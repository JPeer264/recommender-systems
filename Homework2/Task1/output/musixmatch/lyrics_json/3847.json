        "I took myself down to the Tally Ho tavern\nTo buy me a bottle of beer\nAnd I sat me down by a tender young maiden\nWho's eyes were as soft as her hair\n\nAnd as I was searching from bottle to bottle\nFor something un-foolish to say\nThat silver-tongued devil just slipped from the shadows\nAnd smilingly stole her away\n\nI said, \"Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil?\nHe's everything that I ain't\"\nHiding intentions of evil under the smile of a saint\nAll he's good for is getting in trouble and shiftin' his share of the blame\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies\nAching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies\nTurning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying\nHealing as the colors in the sunlight and the shadows of her eyes\nWaking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
