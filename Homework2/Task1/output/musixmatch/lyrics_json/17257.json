        "Hey candy kain brain \nPouring like the rain \nSweeter than any other pain \nI'd even dare name \n\nI kinda sorta need a wind to blow me out \nAnd control the flame \nI kinda sorta need a fuse \nTo light my brain candle - oh yeah \n...\n\n", 
        "It's time to tell the truth\nTo anyone who cares to know\nWhat brought him to this point\nCurled up into a ball\nThey stole the only things that could break his fall\n\nAlmost out of air, far beyond repair, doomed\nTime is wearing thin, the Technicolor is gone\nSee it all numb in black and white\n\nSo now please it's your last drop of air\nSo now breathe and take your very first breath of water\nAllow yourself just one breath of water\nAllow yourself this one last breath\n\nHe ran away from home\nLeaving a trail so friends could hunt\n...\n\n", 
        "You wished all the best for me\nThe best of bad luck that I'll ever need\nKeeping money in your shoes so you look really tall\nAfter reading the fine print,\nI know why it looks so small\n...\n\n", 
        "We don't speak in prose\nSo what's the meaning, no one knows\nI'll lose myself and find no end\nTo make believe I still pretend\n\nI could say I laughed it off\nThen turn around and bump you off\n...\n\n", 
        "Pop culture with a pin\nWatch it wheeze in the air like a dying balloon\nA mistake dawned on me\nAnd the rest of my tribe: \"Your wish is our command\"\nNo really, it's OK\nGive yourself a group hug and a pat on the back\nNo really, it's alright\nPose your best for a shot from the firing squad\n\nChoosing my defence\nI'll stay on the fence\n\nSneak a gun through the gates of heaven\nRaiding tomorrow's prayers with a stained silver bullet\nOh how it kills me waiting to follow through\nOn a dare\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I wasn't around when you were talking\nBut I felt your teeth hit the back of my head\nI'll go outside the first day of winter\nI'll watch the snow change back over to rain\n\nI've got a blister all the way down\nI've got a blister from that sound\nAnd that voice, snow on my shoes\nI've got a blister all the way down\n...\n\n", 
        "Magnetic tapes are old bloodstreams\nFor this recording machine.\nWe're serving all the jaded hearts\nOf those without a place to start.\nAnd washing them of all mistake;\nIll confidence could never fake\nThe notes and bolts that ring this song:\nExpired tales of love gone wrong.\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "(\"Failure\" cover, from album Magnified)\n\nI'll show you a trick with\nants when\nThe sun's high in the sky\nwe can\nBurn them up to crispy\nblack shells\nSee them crunched by\nold, slow, slick snails\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We are here, we were there,\nWe are nearing people everywhere we go.\nPeople catching in their hands\nThe ashes of the Marlboro man.\n\nBurn them down, burn them down\nWith our canteens pouring gasoline;\nIt's never what they're saying\nBut why oh why they say it.\nBurning down the billboards\nTo the ground and not a sound\nWill touch the ears,\nFor the sights to be gained\n...\n\n",
