        "My heart is not lonely or broken\nIt's not of ice or of gold\nNor has my heart ever spoken\nTo me when a love has grown cold\nI felt not the faintest flatter\nWhen you brushed my cheek as you passed\nNor will I willingly clutter\nMy life with these thing that don't last\n\nBe still my heart\nMy heart be still\nBe still my heart\nMy heart be still\n\nIf our eyes should meet then so be it\nNo need to trouble the heart\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
