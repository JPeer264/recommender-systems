In the middle of the jungle where these kids are in a huddle straight up pissin in a puddle keeping xxxxxxx out of bubble. Fell the rhythm of the struggle the vision isn't sutdle but livin in the bubble keeps you distant from the trouble. I'm Choppin it like the captain of the saw mill droppin xxxx puttin patterns in the corn fields after this every town knows that Eso rocks up and pumps the merry-go-round smoke. I love boobs they cushion my hands I love dogs so much I push them in prams but freedom though the pencil is what floods my zone and my pick-up line is take me drunk I'm home. That's right I drink and yell at the bar but at home I have Tinkerbelle in a jar. I shepherd orphans though graveyard livin with vampires my thoughts are ready to play card and piss on camp fires. A mans life is point blank with the beast I wrote it and ruled it. My joints stank up the streets they call me Max Mcfly so damn your crystal ball I've got a license to drive so xxxx your xxx and jam that pistol pork.\n\n[Verus 2:]\nShit. Were not trying to be cool or the cleverest kids but it was probably this crew who drank the beverages. That's why writing time is designed for the whole calendar cause lyrically we killin it like Kilik from soul Caliber. So come on people all aboard the night train first class pass direct to my brain. Wave and laugh at some of the funny people in my memories and how an only child gained bother hood chemistry. I'm just a dreamer with a love for the taste. I keep it hardcore without a gun on my waist. I sit with Bliss and laugh while you're running that race. I'm just a young buck who grew up with mud on his face. So I spread love if you pass the time hearing this sighing out is Eso, Mud and the glassy eyed lyricist.\n\n...\n\n",
