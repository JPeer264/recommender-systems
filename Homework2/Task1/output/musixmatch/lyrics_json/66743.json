        "Send the sky in an envelope\nWell the TV's hanging from the window on a rope\nI didn't mean to say\nWhat I said that time, it's an angry line\n\nStep aboard the train, it's leaving now\nIn a hotel room in a matchbox\nStep aboard the train, it's leaving now\nWell you left me with this ... feeling (?)\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It stretches on for miles\nThere's gold beneath the ice\nHeadlights are the arms\nThe arms of friends\n\nReachin.\n\nChange the locks, the locks\nBefore they come in\nCome in through the floor\n...\n\n", 
        "They're biting at your heels\nCountry lanes lead to fields\nWho was that fox caught in that trap\nLaid with hunters map\nWhen the could rolls back\nback\nback\n...\n\n", 
        "The grass is screaming long\nMidnight cars roll past\nI've been chasing your room\nWhile the summer lasts\n\nSo count it on your fingers\nIf we got it wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't get over how our words are similar\nand I can't make use of all the sense you're making now\nI'd like to leave this town without catastrophe\nWhere the shaking of our hands will hear it's hereditary\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Down here underneath the microscope\nIt's hard to cope\nDon't hide your face in your hands\nCause if your eyes play tricks\nIt's out of my control\nIt's gonna be a long cold winter\nSkeletons and trees\nMy black water child\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a light that follows you\nThere's a light\nLet them in, the hollow you\nBack to back, side by side\n\nIt's the last mile of the day\nHey, everything went white\n...\n\n", 
        "There's nobody out there, it's just the noise of the wind\nThere's nobody out there and nobody is getting in\nI hope that happiness finds it's way to your little house\n\nWhile you were sleeping I, I played a ghost in a sheet\nWhen our frames collide there's nothing left to be\n...\n\n", 
        "There won't be no growing old tonight\nTrail behind at the speed of light\nWhere everything is on beneath the sky\n\nThere you lie, so lovely\nThey pull the body from the river in the early hours\nThere you lie, so lovely\n...\n\n"
