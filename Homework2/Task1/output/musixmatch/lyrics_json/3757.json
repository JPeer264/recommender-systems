        "In a trance of mystery\nThe enigma of your poison is consuming me\nI'm falling so far\nYour scent is so strong\nThe sting of your illusion\nHas broken me down\nYou live in my mind\nSeducing my eyes\nI cannot ignore this feeling that divides\nMy mind\nMy body\nIn all that you have\nScorpio remains delicately sad\n\nScorpio\nSo fragile inside\nThe tragedies of life\nHave forced you to hide\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
