        "There was once truth in what you spoke \nBut teased by doubt alone \nI hear the serpent voice inside me \nSands of time will now dissolve \n\n...\n\n", 
        "In your dark sky \nYou'll see what you always longed to see \nTrying not to be there again \nFrom all silence \nTo the crying voices of the earth \nTrying to believe that you're glad \n\nLifted from the earth realm \nYou will find the place of joy \nCarried by a pair (of) weary hands \nCloaked in silken dresses \n...\n\n", 
        "Darkened Northwind \nFade away from all mankind \nTo the darkness \nIn your heart you feel your dying \nFear the winter \nAnd the cold in which your living \nAlways sadness \nFrom your soul and in your world \n...\n\n", 
        "Darkened Northwind\nFade away from all mankind\nTo the darkness\nIn your heart you feel your dying\nFear the winter\nAnd the cold in which your living\nAlways sadness\nFrom your soul and in your world\n...\n\n",

        "Come heavy sleep, the image of true death \nAnd close up these my - my weary weeping eyes \nWhose spring of tears doth stop my vital breath \nAnd tears my heart with sorrows sight swoll'n cries \n\n...\n\n", 
        "Away the moor is dark beneath the moon,\nAnd rapid clouds have drunk day's last pale beam,\nGathering winds will call darkness so soon,\n...\n\n", 
        "Come, be happy and sit near to me,\nShadow-wested, shadow-wested misery,\nUnwilling silent bride\nMourning in thy, in thy robe of pride\n\nCome, be happy and sit near to me,\nSad as I may seem, sad as I may seem to thee\nI'm happier far than thou,\nLady whose imperial brow is endiademed with woe\n\nHasten, hasten to the bridal bead\n...\n\n", 
        "Waking or asleep, thou of death must deem \nThings more true and deep than we mortals dream \nWe look before and after and pine for what's not \nOur sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught \n\n...\n\n", 
        "You thought you'd be strong \nFar from this place where you've been \nWhen you were in safety so long \nSo sorry you feel \nThat all your strength then was gone \nAnd all hopeful feelings were lost \n\nThis kingdom of yours \nMeans nothing more than a \nSmall tiny point in this universe \n...\n\n", 
        "Many the green isle needs must be \nIn the sea of misery \nOr the mariner who's so worn and won \nNever thus could voyage on \n\nDay and night, and night and day \nAlways drifting on his dreary way \nAlways been drifting on his dreary way \nClosing round vessel's track \n\nWhen dreamers seem to be \nWeltering through eternity \nAnd the dim low line before \n...\n\n",

        "That time, is dead for ever child,\nDrowned frozen dead, for ever\nWe look, on the past and stare aghast\n...\n\n", 
        "Cease, sorrows, now,\nFor you have done the deed,\nLo, Care hath now\nConsumed my carcase quite.\n\nNo hope is left,\nNor help can stand instead,\nFor doleful death\nDoth cut oft pleasure quite.\n...\n\n", 
        "Sorrow, stay! Lend true repentant tears \nTo a woeful wretched wight. \nHence, despair with thy tormenting fears \n0 do not my poor heart affright. \n\nIn darkness let me dwell, \n...\n\n",
