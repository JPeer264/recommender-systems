        "Three important rules for breaking up:\nDon't put off breaking up when you know you want to\nProlonging the situation only makes it worse\nTell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly\nDon't make a big production\nDon't make up an elaborate story\nThis will help you avoid a big tear-jerking scene\nIf you wanna date other people say so\nBe prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected\nEven if you've gone together for only a short time and haven't been too serious\nThere's still a feeling of rejection when someone says she prefers the company of others to your exclusive company\nBut if you're honest and direct and avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you break the news\nThe boy will respect you for your frankness\nAnd honestly, he'll appreciate the kind of straight forward manner in which you told him your decision\nUnless he's a real jerk or a cry baby, you will remain friends\n\nI'm head of the class\nI'm popular\nI'm a quarter back\nI'm popular\nMy mom says I'm a catch\nI'm popular\nI'm never last picked\nI got a cheerleading chick\n\nBeing attractive is the most important thing there is\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Emergency above\nPut on your hard hats and invisible gloves\nWhat's going on?\nI was on the wagon, I thought I was done\nYou have to watch out\nWhen one falls in another can't get out\n\nYou say that I like what you say\nI like what you say\nYou say that I like what you say\nI like what you say\n\nThey say I have to have somebody\nThey say you have to be someones\nThey say if you're not lonely alone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
