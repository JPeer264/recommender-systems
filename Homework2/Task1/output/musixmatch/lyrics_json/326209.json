        "And I watched the sun cross the sky\nA thousand thousand times,\nFrom within this tomb of earth,\nWaiting patiently for the sign,\n\nTo be called by those who would summon us forth to wander once more,\nUnder the waning moon across the bleakness of the fens.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "A brutal banishment,\nA condemnation unfeeling,\nCompels me to wander,\nIn dreadful isolation\nWhy?\nWhy must I leave behind all that once was mine?\nAhead lies only an eternity of vacuum\nNo life awaits here amongst the forlorn soils of the Malediction Fields.\nA people lost,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Uncoiling amongst the stars, my spirit-fight is endless,\nI abandoned the prison of flesh millenia ago,\nParted my veins to shred the last veil,\nShrugged aside the chains that anchored me.\n\nLeft the shattered shell of my corporeal form to descend,\nInto the blackness of this malicious earth,\nAnd as my being merged with the very fabric of this withered planet\nA new pathway was opened before me.\nWith each passing of the moon,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Let these waves take me away,\nLet this tide pull me away.\nLet these waves take me away,\nLet this tide pull me away.\n\nThese ashen waters swallow the grey skies,\nIn this tumultuous churn I gasp and thrash,\nHuman driftwood torn and flung,\nBy the escalating currents of despair,\nAll encompassing bleakness.\n\nI'm under this sea of sorrow,\nI'm under these waves.\nI'm under this sea of sorrow,\nI'm under these waves.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Flayed by the driving rain, of black clouds scud across the sky,\nThe world roars with rage and the very ground trembles.\nI watch as lightening spears the darkness,\nThe stark outline of the trees stripped bare by winters ravaging chill.\n\nWind screams, cutting the knives of sharpened frost,\nAs I raise my arms to embrace the assault,\nAll that lives cowers in the shadow of elemental wrath,\nYet I stand and roar my challenge to the maelstrom.\n\nMountains rear in the darkness,\nColossal megaliths of malediction's promise,\nLooming, immense, all knowing,\nStoic against the fury of the storm.\n\nThe raging tempest shrieks of hatred,\nBunched clouds toil with the need to destroy,\nBut I will remain unmoved in the face of the assault.\nI welcome the pain of nature's vengeance.\nEyes clenched shut,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Alone...\nHollow...\nAshen.\nLife promises only death.\n\nAnd thus I am again sentenced to solitude,\nIn silent contemplation, a vision framed in grey\nFalls upon world-weary eyes and brings torpor.\nThe years behind left drained and colourless.\n\nI look within to fan the embers,\nCharred and enervated beyond recall to flame.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
