        "- For he was the latest result in machine intelligence. The HAL-9000 computer which can reproduce... though some experts still prefer to use the word \"mimic\"... most of the activities of the human brain and with incalculably greater speed... and reliability. We next spoke with the HAL-9000 computer... whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal. Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission. In many ways, perhaps the greatest responsibility... of any single mission element. You are the brain and central nervous system of the ship. Your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation. Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?\n\n- Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer. The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all by any practical definition of the words... fool proof and incapable of error.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
