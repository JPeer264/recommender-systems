        "I'm not tense... it all looks grey, and not quite real... From my ledge I contemplate the fall... Oh. You play with minds, but I feel fine - You know you will not ever break me This is only silence; the violent space between the breakdowns. Sending hot, hot rush of blood heading to the vein. It's not denial... I'm reeling Can't you figure out what you cry about, cause it's nothing that I said.\nThe trip before the fall; the roll before the lightning...\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Don\u2019t you look at me with those eyes\nI hate them, why do they lie?\nRun away from me\nPatient fortunate survivor\nHead for safety within your mind\nPray for safety within numbers\n\nDon\u2019t you look at me with those eyes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
