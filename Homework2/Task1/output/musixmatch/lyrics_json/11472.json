        "My story is much too sad to be told\nBut practically ev'rything leaves me totally cold\nThe only exception I know is the case\nWhen I'm out on a quiet spree\nFighting vainly the old ennui\nAnd I suddenly turn and see\nYour fabulous face\n\nI get no kick from champagne\n...\n\n", 
        "When we played our charade\nWe were like children posing\nPlaying at games, acting out names\nGuessing the parts we played\n\nOh what a hit we made\n...\n\n",
