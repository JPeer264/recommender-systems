        "Far away beyond the horizon,\nabove the shadows of the horses hoofs,\na maiden behind a golden shield\nin a chariot rides across the sky.\n\nTwo ravens are above us,\na long forgotten tale,\nhow it is to reach the utter hail\nand the eyes of a Valkyrjur caress your heart...\n\nWhen a lightning strikes with pride\nand a thunder roars upon us,\nwhen the trees will be beckoned by their dew\nagain\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Once a mighty king ruled in a northern land\nHis enemies he fought with steel and iron hand.\nSo many tales were told, his name a glorious sound,\n\"god-like he is\" they said, and by no christian laws was\nBound.\n\nLong ago in a northern land...\n\nOne day they came across the nordic sea,\nThe man of the cross and camped beside a tree\nWhich was called a sacred one for all thy heathen hearts,\nWhere sacrifices were given to their northern forefathers\nGods...\n\nThe elder and wise men amongst them\nWatched distrustful to all those\nOf the foreign men with their swords in hand\n. and the mighty tree was felled...\n\nSome days gone by and the elder men disappointed,\nThey found a grave with a wooden cross upon.\nSo they all gathered at a place near the sea at night,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "From beyond a twilight horizon where mountains were covered with snow,\nOnce a man on a horse came the way,\nOn an early autumnal morning, when dew lay chill on the ground,\nAnd the sun's first rays heralded the day,\nTo rest at last after riding for more than three days and nights,\nThrough the woods and across the shallow landscapes,\nTo finally reach the village the rumours where talking about,\nAnd where the heathen king lived for many years.\n\nHis golden armour was shining by the light of awakening sun,\nAnd in his hand he held a bronzen shield\nOn which the runes all were written by a blacksmith of wisdom great,\nTo guide him on his way so long.\nHe had come to bring the message the king has given to him,\nTo be conveyed into all heathen countries,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
