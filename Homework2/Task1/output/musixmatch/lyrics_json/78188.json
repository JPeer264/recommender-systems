        "Her dirge still echoes in these woods\nMourning lingers in the vales\nAs the wind cries on the shore\nHer wailing can be heared\n\nMirthless is this wandering through\nHollow days\nLike a pale ghost I waste away in\nThis foul world\n\nWhat sin do I atone for in this\nDreadful way\nWhy the gods snee rat me as I\nKeep writhing in pain\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I'm rushing through the cosmos,\nReaching the light from the beyond the sun\nI see my self dissolving, as universe locks me into its arms\nWhen you dream of the sea of stars\nAnd in the sky the northern lights flame\nSometimes do you remember, hear the silence between the worlds\n\nSwirling surges of plasma, permeate me as i continue my fall\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
