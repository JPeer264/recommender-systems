        "There was a time when men were kind\nWhen their voices were soft\nAnd their words inviting\nThere was a time when love was blind\n\nAnd the world was a song\nAnd the song was exciting\nThere was a time\nThen it all went wrong\n\nI dreamed a dream in time gone by\nWhen hope was high and life worth living\nI dreamed that love would never die\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
