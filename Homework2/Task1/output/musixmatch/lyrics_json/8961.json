        "Feel like Cassandra dancing\nThe last dance of the bones dancing\nIn spite of sudden death as if at last\n\nShe knew in a breath\nWe'll all be dancing on our own\nWith no past, with no regrets\n\nBut Cassandra had problems\nShe denied a God love\n(We are all victims of the dance)\nAnd He ruined her gift of prophecy\n\nShe could see it all\nBut no one believed her, no one believed her\n(We are all victims of the dance)\nNo one believed her when she said\nWe are all victims of the dance\n\nAnd seeing the future\nForeseeing the future\nForeseeing the future's not for us\nIt's unimaginable\n\nOut of the black the faces come faster\nThan the vague slips into sleep eyes rolled\nBack in pain from unconsidered sources\nThe waves of shock when you realize where you've been\n\nFaces you slighted razoring the hours\n(We are all victims of the dance)\nLike you do with that self-marauding\nEdge of ineptitude that calls it all back\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
