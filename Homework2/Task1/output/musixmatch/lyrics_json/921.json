        "Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell\nJimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high\nMama's dancing' with a baby on her shoulder\nThe sun is settin' like molasses in the sky\nThe boy could sing, knew how to move, everything\nAlways wanting more, he'd leave you longing for\n\nBlack velvet and that little boy's smile\nBlack velvet with that slow southern style\nA new religion that'll bring ya to your knees\nBlack velvet if you please\n\nUp in Memphis the music's like a heatwave\n...\n\n", 
        "Every man I meet is in a hurry\nTo find a new romance\nAlways wanna leave the party early\nMaybe I'd like to dance\n\nSlowly, if you really wanna know me\nTake it easy when you hold me\nI might let go\n\nPlay it cool, straight and true\nLook me in the eye\nIf you want to\n(Want to)\nTalk to me\n\nTake your time, don't be shy\nTell me your name\nIf you want to\n(Want to)\nWalk with me\n\nI'm the kind who waits for somethin' special\nInstead of fallin' too fast\nI believe the night is somethin' precious\nThat's why I want it to last\n\nSo slowly, if you really wanna know me\nTake it easy when you hold me\nDon't let me go\n\nPlay it cool, straight and true\nLook me in the eye\nIf you want to\n(Want to)\n...\n\n", 
        "I send a message to you\nI close my eyes and hope it gets through\nIt's in the language of love\nIt's in your touch, there in your mouth\n\nI wonder if you hear me tonight\nSometimes you're so far away\nI wanna have you near me tonight\nDo you belong to me\n\nWho loves you, who you gonna run to\nWho loves you, what you gonna do about it\nWho loves you, who you gonna run to\nWho loves you, what you gonna do about it now\n...\n\n",
