        "Seduced by cranes' call\n\nWhen golden mildness of August nights\nturn into desperate autumn rust\ndoth harvest rot or crop decay\nas the deeds of men trouble them once again\nI inhale the dark depths of fall\nThe last glimpse of day, alas, drifts away\n\nSwans spread their wings and head for the unknown\nrowans side to side bleed from autumnal souls\nThe glow of your eyes and the blaze of your heart\nmy saviour amongst the darkest arts\nIn the starry night thou possess the might over me...\n...\n\n", 
        "When the reeky dreams break\nAnd lead to final condemnation\nWhen the time left behind\nquickens this wicked moment\n\nYou lay as weak as a feather\nunder the heel of the time\nBeyond the grasp of a mortal man\n...\n\n", 
        "My outcast eye tremble from cold\ncan you feel the inner breeze?\nFragments of forlorn warmth are\ndenied by your elusive thoughts\nRelease me from this path of agony\nand bleed all the misery away\nfrom my jaded heart\n\nYou dance into tomorrow's flames\nas I cast lose another dream of you\nYou breed another velvet thought\nand fade it away from my heart\n\nThe night is calm\nI can hear your sigh\nAs one we shiver\nas the rain falls down\n...\n\n", 
        "Seek the truth from my eyes\nCan you see into the depths of my soul? \nCan you see the eternal sin? \nThe morning embracing the sunset\n\nHold your tears in my heart\nLay my arms enchanted tonight\nEnslave your dreams to seek\nFor the throes of the nothingness\n...\n\n", 
        "For the fragile one I will encrypt my thoughts\nThe sinner's tears enthralled by wild agonies\nThe inner deception, betrayal of dawn\nIn the gloom's paradise you will inherit my scars\nA wound of mankind, a spirit in blood, \nThe unfamiliar guest beneath the masquarade\nFight for me to dim the daylight, \nTo suffocate the sun, to justify your needs\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I would come back to say the words\nbut I dream of a little sacrifice\nthat will alter my destiny's place in life\n\nI can see, the autumn leaves have fallen for me\nin the end there's nothing but this solution\nWhen destiny fails, will my pain fade away?\n\nI see no point in going on\nWill my heart encounter the trembling stars?\n\nMy pretended guilt bleeds for eternity,\nfor an obsolete, fragmented mind\nWhy can't I deny my frailty,\na crave for everything that is denied\nTake me away, shattered illusion\n...\n\n", 
        "Hatred is my sceptre, instrument of doom\nArmor made of cruelty, inhuman tortured misery\nDeception's woven into my cape, I wrap betrayal around\nOn my throne I sit and moan and wear the crown of decadence\n\nHave I found myself, have I seen the closer glimpse of truth\nI ain't even slipping yet, I've got white soul to denigrate\n...\n\n", 
        "At times my empty and tangled eyes betray\nTo believe this I need more than mere faith\nIn this cold and desolate ward of mind\nIntoxicated truth I bear inside\n\nAt times this shattered being is lost\n\nFor it all is gone I've sharpened the blade in my dreams\nIn alteration I have broken old entities\nIn a kind of mental subtraction\n...\n\n", 
        "The oath sworn by the faithful\nDecades of decayed thoughts, false belief\nCrushed by one man with the sword of word\nThe chosen one is yet to be come... \n\nWorship the messenger of the true god\nAnd the pain, which flows from heavens\n...\n\n", 
        "Words echo in abyss, the glow of rotten moon\nLights the path I stumble, from one misery to another\nI just want to dream, to see through my destiny\nThe final blaze of heart, the hymn for torn apart\n\n[Chorus:]\nBurning, bleeding passion\nI bear fire in my heart\n...\n\n", 
        "Seduced by cranes' call\n\nWhen golden mildness of August nights\nTurn into desperate autumn rust\nDoth harvest rot or crop decay\nAs the deeds of men trouble them once again\nI inhale the dark depths of fall\nThe last glimpse of day, alas, drifts away\n\nSwans spread their wings and head for the unknown\nRowans side to side bleed from autumnal souls\nThe glow of your eyes and the blaze of your heart\nMy saviour amongst the darkest arts\n...\n\n",
