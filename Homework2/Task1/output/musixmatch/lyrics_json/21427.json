        "In a city of cream, we're floating by\nlike creeps and tars under neon skies\nin colours of green, scarlet and blue\nshe's taking my hand... leading me to'\nA secret room, I can feel her breath\nher body is tanned, my head in a mess\nthe flavour is sweet, God given bright\nMaster of intelligence won't find me tonight\nAll these beautiful faces, taking me places\n...\n\n", 
        "Waiting for a sign, a touch of your grace\nTo carry me home, under these waves... I'm slipping...\nCrying like a child for the day to begin, to follow your breeze, hunted by your skin\nI'm slipping\nSo please, do me right woman\nCause I'm hanging by a thread, far from divine\n...\n\n"
