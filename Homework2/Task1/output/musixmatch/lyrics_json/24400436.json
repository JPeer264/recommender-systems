        "Lowkey, you won't tell none of your friends about me\nYou won't tell them I occupy your dreams and your thoughts\nLook at what we have started\nI feel so good when I leave your apartment\n\nI know, there's no telling how far you can go\nAnd you won't want to hear about my love and my lust\nBabe that I have been feeling\nI kiss you once, then I stare at the ceiling\n\nOl\u00e9, you bring too much sunlight to my day\nAnd only you can chase the pain away\nYou bring too much sunlight to my day, my day\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
