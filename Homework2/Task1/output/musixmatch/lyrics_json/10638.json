        "The night is drawing on but all the strain not told on him\nAnd he won't fall into the sleep of the just\nTo be a tumbler or a lonesome intruder\nHe is as good as gold and searching for trust\n\n(be), to be the harlequin who shines in dead gold\nTo kill those idle thoughts about this stronghold\n(see), see the evening star in this sunset glow\nSailing the splendour ships straight on the port bow\n\n(pre-chorus)\nStrike the sands of ever\nThe lingering sound of dreams\nIn harsh reality\nTurn over a new leaf\nArdently desired\nAnd forever\n\n(chorus)\n...\n\n", 
        "In this illusive game\nLatent worlds are waiting just for you\nSo won't you join?\nDon't ponder over things that might be new\n\nIt's stronger than a vivid dream\nIt is the venture you esteem\nThe art of make-believe\nWhen holding life in your own hand\nAnd there is no way to withstand\nUnravel what deceives\n\n(chorus)\n...\n\n", 
        "He was named nineteenhundred \"TD\"\nIn the ship's belly lies his cradle\nHad no birthday and no land of home\nThe ocean has no bounds\nVirginian sounds\nAnd he faced the world from inside\nThe ball-room of splendid skies\nAnd on the grand piano\nHis hands light as butterflies\nHe played for the rich and for the poor\nThrilling the hearts of all\nThe world could have been beneath his feet\nSearching the call\nThe voice of the sea\n\nOld chandelier tells a story\nOld piano still echoes in here\n...\n\n", 
        "The dew-drop of dawn\nAre glaring in morningly light\nThe silver clouds gone\nThe indian summer so bright\n\nI hear the piper so nigh\nThe westerly wind brings his tone\nThe tree-tops so far in the sky\nI follow those traces unknown\n\n(chorus)\n...\n\n", 
        "Here, I can hear a pin drop, silence is my friend\nHave not found a helping hand\nAnd I, I can paint in gloomy colors that will stain\nBut will one of them remain\n\n(pre-chorus)\nWe are searching for the answers\nAlways take a bearing on\nWe're dancing 'round the golden calf until the crack of dawn\n\n(chorus)\nThe limelights fade away\nOn this revolting stage of our dreams\nWe're just about to leave the scene\nThough we're still in between\nOn the chessboard square of life, the pawn\nSo tell me where the road goes on\n...\n\n", 
        "As sure as fate\nAs all draws to a close\nA momentous weight\nAs an era goes\nHomeward bound am I\nBut will my heart ever be\nThe sands have run out\n\nWoebegone the face\nThe parting hour is near\nThe beauty of this place\nThis flame of passion here\nA bitter errand waits\nIn the wake of memories\nThe sound of my fate\n...\n\n", 
        "A glassy heart is crying\nAnd for all the dreams denying\nNever smiles\nAlways on the move\n\nBy the years it's raked with fire\nAnd the heyday of desire's\nFar to reach\nDown and out it lies\n...\n\n", 
        "Through this old skylight our eyes are open wide\nThe sky bespangled in the rain\nAnd we feel called upon but interests collide\nNot much to lose, a lot to gain\n\nDon't lose your line of sight now\nAnd raise the barricades somehow\nIt's time to leave the lores so blow them skyhigh\nIn sound and fury they will fly\n\n(chorus)\n...\n\n", 
        "When a gentle girl can win\nPrayer from out the lips of sin\nWhen a child gives up tears\n...\n\n", 
        "Time stands still in canterville\nFor ages this curse lays upon\nPass the night walking for fourhundred years\nLonging for this liaison\n\nThe barren almond once shed the leaves\nThe splendour has crumbled away\nThis harm was done and the green-eyed one\nOnce it had led him astray\n\n(pre-chorus)\nHere in the absence of light\nLet a willing ear roam\nAnd far into the night\nA ray of hope will lead you home\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Out in the prairie the bison dared to roam\nThe crying of a lone shot claimed they're forever gone\nHigh in the breezing winds an eagle dared to fly\nFor the white man's sake the covenant was just a lie\n\nOut in the flowing streams the beaver dared to build\nThe never ending ignorance the paleface's guilt\nA single tent was left lonesome in the woods\nWhen the cannons spoke the words\nMurderers took off the hoods\n...\n\n", 
        "Along the banks of austral silence\nThe honey rivers flow\nTime seems standing still before my eyes\n\nThe velvet sound of the ocean waves\nWhite sand underneath\nIn the land of eternity\n\nThe old bridge tells a story\nOf long gone centuries\nAnd the gardens of a king far away\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In my darkest hour I pray\nFor a life seemed gone astray\nSee a flower grow\n\nIn a never ending night\nFar away a colored light\nI can see a rainbow rise\n\n[Chorus]\nI could believe\nIn the love I found so long\nYou're the air that I breathe\n...\n\n", 
        "I remember a past life, a life long ago\nMemories are reveries\nAnd visions fading into grey\n\nI behold the paleness with the glimpse of an eye\nThere's no friend in no man's land\nStreets leading to wild frontiers\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet the torchlight shine above you\n...\n\n", 
        "Clouds passing by\nOn top of the mountains one touch in the sky\nOne touch in the sky\n\nOne reason to linger\nHolding the stars right in my hand\nLifting shadows of the past\n\nCrystal silhouettes\nLonging for me\nTheir eyes full of regrets\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm walking along the river\nRaindrops fall from the sky\nEagle above never wonders\n'bout all the feelings gone by\n\nThe flower-buds open their hearts\nThey're begging for water to fall\nAs they're starting to fill up my senses\nI recognize them all\n\n(chorus)\nFalling far beyond the horizon\n...\n\n", 
        "The sun has set beyond the western sky\nAnd with the coming night you hear 'em cry\n\nFrom the fear they were overrun\nFrom the hurricane they were spun\nThe candle has lost its flame\nCause they play the final game\n\nOut from the dust they danced apart from all\nAll warnings overheard until they call\n...\n\n", 
        "Seems I was sleeping for one thousand years\nThe wheel of time has turned into the age of tears\nHow long I am in there I cannot tell for sure\nBut the flower starts to fade she has to endure\n\n(Chorus)\nTake me back from beyond the horizon\nFor a little while\nLet me feel the idea of a sun dance\nI will hold my head up high\n...\n\n", 
        "The edge of the abyss where the journeys end\nVisible crossroads where mortal lives will bend\nThe moment of truth, the calm before the storm\nThe camouflage of liars abruptly will be torn\n\nAt the end of the tunnel I'm awaiting the truth\nThrough the misty twilight perhaps eternal youth\nDo I feel the pale void, do I feel the seventh sky?\nWhen life runs like a movie as the time goes by\n\n[Chorus]\nDo I fly, do I cry, do I see the light?\nIn blinding colors does it shine so bright\nCan I flee, can I see, can I be something new?\n...\n\n",
