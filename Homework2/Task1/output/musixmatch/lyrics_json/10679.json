It's looking bleak\n\nThey control the treasure of our birthright\nAnd to survive we have to struggle and fight\nThe present confrontation of our mind\nThe flexibility of our vision\n\nWhat is life? I try to see\nWhat is life? It's unity\nWhat is life? I try to feel\nWhat is life? It's really real\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
