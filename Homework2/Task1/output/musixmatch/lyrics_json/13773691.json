        "ost in the midst of an aging crowd\nThe dream is a dream aloud\nOr just a mental illness dreamt of and then sold\nAnd despite which way this conscience sways\nI'm finding it hard to stop or switch pace\nCommunity in common grounds\nHave you ever stepped inside yourself\nTo see the truth is a dream aloud\nAnd there is no telling what is wrong with us\nAnd to all that's wrong with us...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Standing on a balcony\nAt one with the concrete beneath me\nI know nothing of the night\nBlistering under a cruel light\nShone down through cracks in the skyline\nAs I speak circles to you\n\nLook at all the moral sin\nAren't you sick of taking everything by numbers\n...\n\n", 
        "it's three a.\nm.\nand i can't seem to close my eyes.\na piece of me is missing when you're not by my side.\nnobody knows how much i need this.\n...\n\n"
