        "A single voice is joined by multitudes in song\nWith every verse\nthey're finding harmonies that rise to heaven sure and strong,\nRicher and richer the soil on which they thrive\nHigher and higher a hymn of what it means to be alive\nYou've got to give a little more than you take\nYou've got to leave a little more than was here\nYou may be prideful of the strides you will make\nBut keep one thing clear\nYou're just a player in a much bigger plan\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't want to kiss you good night\nI'll just keep on holding you tight\n'Cause baby, I know. You'll change and you'll grow.\nYou'll get bigger with each morning light.\n\nI know that the sky's full of stars.\nAnd dreams call your name from afar.\nI'm anxious to see, all you're gonna be.\n...\n\n",
