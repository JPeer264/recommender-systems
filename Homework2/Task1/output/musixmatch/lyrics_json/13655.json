        "Farewell my child it's time\nTo leave this all behind\nExchanging the river for the sea\nFarewell to saturday's child\nCut loose before his prime\nSet adrift in the city\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Father, Father\nCan you tell me\nWhere the hours go\nWhere time flows?\n\nIt is written in the stars\nUpon the milky way\nWe must burn bright\nBefore we fade away\n\nMother, Mother\nCan you tell me\nWhere the fire goes\n...\n\n", 
        "When all you have left are your memories\nAnd diamonds and pearls for company\nI'll be sailing to St. Lucia on the ocean breeze\nWith the moon and my scars for company\n\nIn your bedroom you keep an iron cage\nWhere a blackbird sings her freedom song\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes when I'm alone\nI imagine that the world is a mirror\nAnd in my mind's eye behold my dark inner nature\n\nI've been wasting time on this time honoured whore\n'Til I get so confused I can't see anymore\nAnd I have crawled where I should have seen the signs\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I am believing words again\nHere I am trying to find your love again\nHere I am down on my knees again\nPraying for a love we used to know\n\nBoth of us know how hard it is to love and let it go\nBoth of us know how hard it is to go on living that way\nBut so few know what it means to fall in love\nAnd so few know how hard it is to live without it\n...\n\n", 
        "The old clock is ticking now\nMarks the space between us\nYour memory enshrouds my heart\nFor I am held a captive\n\nSometimes my soul desires\nTo take leave of this old world\nTo spread these golden wings and fly\nTo the city of angels\n\nBut then if I close my eyes\nI can see you standing there\nYour face in permanence smiles\n...\n\n", 
        "Woke up this morning\nSet off down the road\nLeft behind me all those years\nSearching for a common soul\nI've been looking for a thousand\nAnd one distractions\nTo empty my mind\nOf thoughts of loneliness\nI've been looking for someone\n...\n\n", 
        "All love's lost children\nBehind us... forgotten\nYouth lies broken\nUpon the wheel of the machine\nEach time we kill their song\n\nTime feeds our memories\nWe travel through past lives\nWe... are angels\nPart devil in disguise\nYou sow the seeds of our demise\n\n...\n\n",
