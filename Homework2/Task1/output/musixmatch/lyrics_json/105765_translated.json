        "If I was a bird in your hand\nLonging for a new Fairyland\nYou've opened up my door\nYou've set me free\nAlways would return to your hand\n\nIf I was a pearl on the ground\nOnly deep blue sea all around\nBut you would find my light\nYou'll rescue me one day\nWhen all my calls will resound\n\nBut if I was a flash in your daydream\nOne day you'll see my sign on your way\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We're on the way back in the moment now\nWe're on the way back in the moment now\n\nI stare into space, I'm in your mind now\nI did grieve you, you somehow\nI stare into you, will you bear more pain?\nI know your thoughts drive me insane\n\nI close my eyes alone in my room\nThere is no silence in my head\nI try to see the truth, the way I loose\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Girl of 16\nWhole life ahead of her\nSlashed her Wrists\nBored with Life\nDidn't succeed\nThank the Lord\nFor small mercies\n\nFighting back the Tears\nMother reads the Note again\n16 Candles burn in her Mind\nShe takes the Blame\nIt's always the same\nShe goes down\nOn her Knees\n...\n\n", 
        "Otium cum dignitate\nOtium cum dignitate\nOtium\n\nSun shines bright\nMy heart is laughing\nI'm happy\nWhat I do is nothing\n\nA light heart\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I send a request to your heart \nMy hope is gone it tears my dreams apart \nI lay my head now down to sleep \nThe time is now to find out what I need \n\nI loose my way, I journey far \nOn roads of heaven fills with love \n\n...\n\n", 
        "There's something inside me\nthat pulls beneath the surface\nconsuming, confusing\nThis lack of self-control I fear\nis never ending\ncontrolling...\n\nI can't seem\nto find myself again\nmy Walls are closing in\nI've felt this way before\nto find myself again\nmy Walls are closing in\nI've felt this way before\nSo insecure\n\n[Chorus]\n\nCrawling in my skin\n...\n\n", 
        "Colder than ice\nThe world falls apart\nCold like a stone\nThe spell on the souls\nColder than ice\nYour hand on my hearth\nA world made of stone\nLet tenderness freeze\n\nSave the fairyland we live in\nWhere all failings are forgiven\nFeel like hunted by a griffin\nI fall down\nStraight down\nSave the fairyland we live in\nWhere my failings are forgiven\nFeel like hunted by a griffin\nI'm falling straight down\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Colder than Ice\nThe World falls apart\nCold like a Stone\nThe spell on the Souls\nColder than ice\nYour hand on my Heart\nA world made of stone\nLet tenderness freeze\n\nSave the Fairyland we live in\nWhere all failings are forgiven\nFeel like hunted by a Griffin\n...\n\n", 
        "One day in summer,\nA light comes to me.\nOpens up my heart,\nAnd leads me to\n\nA place where sadness\nMelts like winter snow.\nA place full of faith,\nA little peace of heaven.\n\nThe sun shines high\n...\n\n", 
        "Colder than ice, the world falls apart\nCold like a stone, the spell on the souls\nColder than ice, your hand on my heart\nA world made of stone, let tenderness freeze\nSave the fairyland we live in\nWhere all failings are forgiven\nFeel like hunted by a Griffin\nI fall down, straight down\nSave the fairyland we live in\nWhere my failings are forgiven\nFeel like hunted by a Griffin\nI'm falling straight down\nCatch my daydream\n...\n\n"
