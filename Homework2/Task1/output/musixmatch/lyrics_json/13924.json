        "Hello, hello\nI like your smile\nHello, hello\nShall we talk awhile\n\nWould you like some of my tangerine\nI know I'd never treat you mean\n\nNever knew how I'd meet you\n...\n\n", 
        "We've only just begun\nTo live\nWhite lace and promises\nA kiss for luck and we're on our way\nWe've only begun\nBefore the rising sun\nWe fly\nSo many roads to choose\n...\n\n", 
        "I may not always love you\nBut long as there are stars above you\nYou never need to doubt it\nI'll make you so sure about it\n\nGod only knows what I'd be without you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "To lead a better life\nI need my love to be here\n\nHere, making each day of the year\nChanging my life with a wave of her hand\nNobody can deny that there's something there\nThere, running my hands through her hair\n...\n\n", 
        "Listen baby, ain't no mountain high,\nAin't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough;\nBaby if you need me call me no matter where you are,\nNo matter how far;\nJust call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;\nYou don't have to worry,\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nRemember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n...\n\n", 
        "You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry\nAll you need is for love to go wrong\nYou don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry\nOr to lie awake the wh-o-le ni-i-ght long\n\nWhen you leave me my golden rainbow disappears\n...\n\n", 
        "Why do birds\nSuddenly appear?\nEverytime you are near\nJust like me\nThey long to be\nClose to you\n\nWhy do stars\nFall down from the sky?\nEverytime you walk by\nJust like me\n...\n\n", 
        "To lead a better life\nI need my love to be here\n\nHere, making each day of the year\nChanging my life with a wave of her hand\nNobody can deny that there's something there\nThere, running my hands through her hair\n...\n\n",

        "Sunrise, sunset x2\nSwiftly flow the days\nSeedlings turn over night to sunflowers\nBlossoming even as they gaze\n\nSunrise, sunset x2\nSwiftly fly the years\nOne season following another\nLaden with happiness and tears\nIs this the little girl I carried\n...\n\n", 
        "Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy,\n(My guy)\nnothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy.\n(My guy)\nI'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter,\nlike birds of a feather we stick together,\nI'm tellin' you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy.\n\nNothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy,\n(My guy)\nnothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy.\n(My guy)\nI gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful, and I'm gonna,\n...\n\n",

        "The look of love\nIs in your eyes\nThe look your smile can't disguise\nThe look of love\nIs saying so much more\nThan just words could ever say\nAnd what my heart has heard\nWell it takes my breath away\n\nI can hardly wait to hold you\nFeel my arms around you\nHow long I have waited\nWaited just to love you\nNow that I have found you\n...\n\n",

        "Why does the sun go on shining?\nWhy does the sea rush to shore?\nDon't they know it's the end of the world\nCause you don't love me anymore?\nWhy do the birds go on singing?\nWhy do the stars glow above?\n...\n\n"
