        "At first I was afraid, I was petrified,\nKept' thinkin' I could never live without you by my side,\nBut then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong,\nAnd I grew strong, and I learned how to get along,\n\nAnd so you're back, from outer space\nI just walked in to find you here without that look upon your face\nI should have changed my fuckin' lock, I would have made you leave your key\nIf I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me\n\nOh, now go, walk out the door\nJust turn around, now, you're not welcome anymore\nWeren't you the one who tried to break me with desire\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)",
