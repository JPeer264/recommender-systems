        "Always waiting for something more to come\nAlways waiting for the Summer sun\nTo come lighten my days up\nBefore it is gone\n\nAlways one step ahead in my mind\nAnd as the time goes by\nEveryday seems to cover the meaning\nOf the things that I like\n\n...\n\n", 
        "And the time, yeah, the time will come\nAt least they say it does for some\nUntil then, cheers to better days\nThat will come, that will come our way\n\nSeems like the world's still spinning round\n...\n\n", 
        "The blank stood soberly and watched\nHow my love would collide with their usual fuss\nThey bring you down fast round here\n\nAnd lies weaved endless hopes of you\nI know you won't fool me another time\nAnd I've been outloved before\n...\n\n", 
        "Weave your fingers in mine\nPut your thoughts on the line\nYou say it's sad we can't be\nAll that we're capable to see\nAnd the thoughts that I've had\nOh, you wouldn't believe me\nThey would keep you awake\nForever believe me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If rain keeps falling all day\nIf I'd wake up all bored and alone\nIf days would turn into weeks\nWithout a sound of you coming home\nIt would feel like everything I had was gone\n\nThe rain keeps falling all day\nBut I can feel Spring in the air\nThat would mean nothing to me\nNothing if you were not here\nGuess I really wouldn't be aware\n...\n\n", 
        "Jennie, won't you come home?\nBeen so cold, now you're gone\nI hide my heart so no-one sees\nAll the love that dwell inside of me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The tambourines are shaking but I don\u2019t hear a sound\nIt\u2019s my favorite song but I don\u2019t like the crowd\nWish I was able to see what you see\nTurn all the words into poetry\nSo I close my eyes\nI\u2019m focused on whatever\u2019s spinning in my mind\nAnd I try to find a sign\nBut I never learn to read between the lines\n...\n\n", 
        "In the calm, taking stories from your eyes\nFor me to see\nBut everytime the wind blows back my hair\nI can hear your voice ringing in the air\nYou can win me back, win me back, win me back, win me back\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish I could remember all days in my life\nIf you ask what's on my mind\nI tell you I'll dedicate all of my time\nTo everything that makes me come alive\n\nI like to think there is magic\nStaring out in the blue\nI'd like to think that the Sun and the stars\nShine just because of you\n\n...\n\n",

        "With the falling rain came the scent of our times\nI whipped you off and felt so awkwardly alive\nI pretend to think about my health and what's true\nBut the only one I ever think about is you\n\nWhatever the season I'll be around your block\n...\n\n"
