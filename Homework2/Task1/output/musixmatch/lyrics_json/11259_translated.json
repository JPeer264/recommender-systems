        "This is why I always wonder\nI'm a pond full of regrets\nI always try to not remember rather than forget\n\nThis is why I always whisper\nWhen vagabonds are passing by\nI tend to keep myself away from their goodbyes\n\nTide will rise and fall along the bay\nAnd I'm not going anywhere\nI'm not going anywhere\nPeople come and go and walk away\nBut I'm not going anywhere\n...\n\n", 
        "Polly left on Christmas Eve\nI will know as long as I live that it was all\nYou had in mind\nShe was turning twenty-eight\nAnd I always thought it's too late to tell you\nI never cried\n\nThere was so many ways to hide\n...\n\n", 
        "Mind you believe me and maybe forgive me\nRather than simply run\nWe're getting closer, each time it's over\n'Cause you are the only one\n\nEvery beginning has a new screening\nOf our broken plan\nNext time you depart make sure we're apart\n'Cause love should be entertained\n\nDoes it have to be from far away\n...\n\n", 
        "Close your eyes and roll a dice\nUnder the board there's a compromise\nIf after all we only lived twice\nWhich lies the run road to paradise\n\nDon't say a word, here comes the break of the day\nAnd wide clouds of sand raised by the wind of the end of May\n\nClose your eyes and make a bet\n...\n\n", 
        "He was a sailor\nA sailor at sea and a sailor of love\nAnd he thought he could save her\nSave her from innocence up and above\n'cause he never knew freedom and under the duvet\nHe stayed for a lifetime without any government\nHelp or assistance\n\nShe was a widow\nShe never left home before seven a.m.\nAnd she looked by the window\nShe managed to cry but she never feel blame\nFor the death of her husband who died in a flame by the house of the river\nAlthough he remained\nIn a reasonable distance\n\nAll the children played around the neighborhood\nAll the children played around the neighborhood\n...\n\n", 
        "The pale blue light along the coast\nIs one of those I miss the most\nThere was that day\nYou touched my hair\nAnd said, my love, it's so unfair\nIt's too late to sit in the sun\nAnd lately we've just begun\nOh it's too late to tell everyone\nBut lately we've just begun\nThe one thin light that drove the peer\n...\n\n", 
        "Over and over, you wanted it so fast\nHead on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass\nWait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake\nThen make a sad face and tell me it's too late\n\nRight now and right here\nMy love oh my dear\nI'll try to be clear\nMy love oh my dear\n\nOver and over, you wanted me play\n...\n\n", 
        "Look at me, I'm only seventeen\nThe many years between us have been broken\nLook at me, under the evergreen\nLife is a mellow dream almost unspoken\n\nBy the way, you said you're here to stay\nLet me love you 'til tomorrow\nThen it will last a year and a day\n...\n\n", 
        "Home is like a river of goodbye\nWithout a summer lullaby since you are gone\nNo one rings the bell from what I've heard\nI'm all alone just like a bird without a song\n\nLife is an endless parade, it's no sweet lemonade\n...\n\n", 
        "Darling\nI will remember, darling\nI've been\nMellow and tender\nI've seen water\nBy the cathedral\nUnder the maple\nIt was in April\nYou wore a raincoat\nBy the cathedral\n...\n\n"
