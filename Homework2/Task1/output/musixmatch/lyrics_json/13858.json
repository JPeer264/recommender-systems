        "Always did it my way, on my own, then one day, I realized\nI was blind, nothing I could do on my own\nTurn, we have found a way to see, look up... feel the Almighty\nTake control as we gaze into Your eyes\nWe're just the tool You use to bring this world to You\nOh, Lord, how we love You\nWith Your grace, take away the hurt and the bruises inside;\nReach down, let Your glory reside\nThe cross carried for all of us, paint the image in my mind\nSo I will never think I am something,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)", 
        "Confusing and scared,\nthere is a decision made with this choice\na child has to pay\nShe puts its life in her hands,\nand then she destroys its only chance to become someone in life\nYou should have thought about the baby before you had sex,\nbecause you have destroyed a gift from God\nYou kill,\nyou destroyed\nNever will this baby be able to grow up or show its love\nYou'll never hear it say \"I love you, I love you\"\nGod does not give you the privilege to carry a child for nothing\nWhen you kill,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)", 
        "Her body twitches, unbearable pain\nLord, bring me out of this, why doesn't he stop, love does not exist\nHer insides feel like an unbearable hell\nConfusion runs through her mind\nShe prays so loud, she cries from the inside\nWhy, why, why, why; how could someone do this to me?\nHe has taken this gift from her, fright in her eyes;\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)", 
        "All I wanted was someone to love me...\nI tried to cry out from the inside, but I guess my soul did not pour itself out enough\nBlood on the walls, flaming black, blood on the walls,\nI saw you staring through the cracks\nNo one was to know what was happening in me; I felt no love,\nI felt no reason to carry on with my life\nEverything was wrong, nothing was right, at least that is what I thought\nKids finding laughter at my expense\nThey were killing me on the inside they couldn't give up their pride\nMy heart was bleeding from so much grieving\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)", 
        "I lay as the sacrifice to this unholy altar;\nThe evil inside...\nSatan, Satan...\nSit and watch me die\nDemented screams; tortured beings;\nWhere's your hope; where's your smile?\nThere was none...\nLife of lies...\nGone; gone...\nNo more.\nSo upset; so distraught;\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)", 
        "[Hidden track]\n\nI wait for my true love, but she never came\nI cry for my true love, but she never came\nI leave this world never knowing who she was, departing all alone.\n\nI'd just like to speak for a second and say that, um. I just encourage everybody who hears this album to look towards Christ and not towards people, because people allow you to fall away, people aren't perfect. Theres only one person that's perfect and that's Christ. And I see people every day who are looking at Christ and blow Christ off because something that someone else has failed on. And its just not worth it, Christ has blessed me and every other member of this band more than any other way that I can imagine, or be spoken. Just the way everything worked out tonight was just beautiful. I just pray for each and every one of you, we wouldn't sit here and we wouldn't do this unless we wouldn't put the time into it unless it was trying to touch you, trying to reach your life and I just ask please just give your heart to Christ, and allow him to come in and just accept him. It says, \"If you acknowledge that you have sinned and you ask Christ to come into you life, he will enter you life just believe that he's died on the cross for your and risen on the third day, and Christ can life for you and he with you? and I just pray that you just give him that chance to do that, you don't know what you missed, you don't know what you missed until you haven't had something and realize that its gone, then you realize what you've missed and what hasn't been in your life. And I just ask you please just give the LORD a chance to do that and I just hear a lot of people say that its just, I hear a lot of people say that its just you know, \"Oh? you know, \"this some religious person is trying to force this down my throat.? well that's not our intent our intent's not to force this down your throat. We do this because we love you and we care for the people that do hear this. And I just wish everybody just to look towards it and give it a chance, and not fall out. There is hope, you can find it, and Christ is hope and your never gonna feel a void, your never gonna feel that huge gap and that void in your life until you turn and you look at the truth, even though you may not see it as the truth, I just pray that God will reveal himself to you and you can open your eyes, just as we were in your same shoes and he opened ours, he opened our eyes eyes. just... even though it's this late you can't even speak, I just pray that He'll please just show you his power. This album goes out to just, the victims of rape and suicide, child molestation, people who are broken hearted, people who just cant handle life anymore and just have to fall on their knees every night and cry. There is a better way, and we have found it, please don't give up, there is a better way.\n\nSpirit of, the living God\nCall fresh on, me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
