        "Lost my breath, I'm feeling weak\nMy bones escape my skin\nI don't know how It's been this long\nSince I last let you in\nWishing I could find a way to never have to hear you say\nYou'll never spend another day alone\n\nThinking I might take a drive to go where you have been\nI need to think I need to breathe, I'll never love again\nI thought you knew\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Silly thing, like diamond rings\nFall between other things like you and I\nWe used to have, a coffee pot, we used it a lot\nTo sit around and talk about everything\nWe always want, but we'll never get\n\nBut a dreamer is still a dreamer until you wake them up\nAnd sit them down and explain to them\nThe sky is up and the earth is down amongst other things\nLike human beings, they really aren't what hey seem\nThey will lie cheat and steal to get ahead of you\n\nAnd I'm afraid its true\n...\n\n", 
        "When I see your face\nThe big bright skies above me can't turn grey\nNow I just won't let them keep a stupid grin upon my face\nLately I've been told, the web of lies you spun me turned to gold\nMade a dress for you that day, that's what they say\nPick you up and spin you round, lay you down upon the ground\n\nNow I'm thinking that maybe your not all I need\nThat's what she said, that's what she say\nDarling forgive me now, you've got me down on my knees\nThat's what she said, that's what she say\nThinking about leaving, thinking about getting some sleep\nThat's what I say\nThat's what she say, that's what she say\n...\n\n", 
        "Chills down my spine\nWhen I feel your heart next to mine\nFeel the ground beneath my feet turn into the sky\nFeel this thing so strong and true, It can't be a lie\n\nSo I'll wait,\nJust waiting for the sign that your love is not only mine\nI can't believe this feeling seeping out my smile\n...\n\n", 
        "I saw the sun, blinked once or twice and then babe you were gone\nYou took my hand, led me blindly to run, away from all the things that I lost, I lost\n\nI took your hand, led you to a place that you've never been\nYour turned around gave me such a sweet grin, I knew then that you were the one\n\nRun around hand in hand, chasing smiles and soft white sand\nLooking out for number one, skipping rocks on the river till the day is done\nAnd I'm fully convinced, that you just might find someone else\n\n(And it scares me to death\nWell, it scares me, too)\n\nThen she walked by, you could just tell by that look in her eye\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't wake me up\nTook so long for me\nTo fall asleep last night\nThrough tears I could hardly breathe\nThinking maybe these stupid whiskey dreams\nAre going to kill me soon\n\nTried my best to go out last night\nSaw some people, didn't care\nCouldn't even try\nThinking darling that you should take me back\nBefore I loose my mind\n...\n\n", 
        "walking in the winter\ndown roads of empty sidewalks... I reached in to my pocket, found an old note from you.\nIt read \"babydoll I love you, I can't wait to see you sunday\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Cocaine hurricane forgot to pay the bills\nTwenty bucks well that's enough\nFor a couple cheap thrills\n(Da da dada dada da da) Whiskey shot, I'd rather not\nI already forgot your name\nBack of the bar, its not that far\nYou already know this game\n(Da da dada dada da da) When you go, don't wake me up\nDon't even give me a shake\nGirls like you and guys like me\nWe only make mistakes\n(Da da dada dada da da) And I'm just hoping that this world\nThis world is gonna end\nAin't got no plan now no, no job\nNo money to spend\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Every time I close my eyes I hear your voice and see your smile\nWish I could feel it, spread through my lips\n\nIf you forget to think my name I\"ll send it floating on a wave\nRight into your hands, so you can trace it in the sand\n\nIf I cant swim if I cant float I'd build my love into a boat and sail to you dear\nInstead I'm stuck here\nAll of my thoughts are stranded seaside yet I know it would be alright if you were here\nLying warm soft and near\n\nJust knowing how it feels right, to close my eyes when I'm by your side\nFeel your fingers laced within mine, makes me feel in love again\n\nBut darling know when I wake, open sleepy eyes to your face\nFeel so lonely think I might take off without a note again\n...\n\n", 
        "Wish I could forget the way your fingers feel within mine\nThe thrill of broken promises is crippling my spine\nCan't get the smell of him out of my thoughts and clothes\nAnd I'm afraid the one who loves me might already know\n\nWaiting alone on the porch until two\nMy cigarette ashes because of you\nI'm a clever boy don't ask me how I knew\nBut I think I found you out\n\nDarling, I swear it just isn't true\nHe's just a friend I'm in love with you\nLook in my eyes I'm telling the truth\nNow come lay back down\n\nOoh, Ooh\n...\n\n", 
        "i'll try to make it back soon\ni missed you when i left the room\nyou're my best friend\nyou're my best friend\nwe come along so far now\nlaughing as we watch the clouds\nyou're my best friend\nyou're my best friend\nyou\nyou know you mean the world to me\ni can't think of a better thing then growing old with you\nyou know i need you by my side\nand everything seems better now with you here in my life\ni'll be setting with you\nchasing dreams inside my room\n...\n\n", 
        "(A giant, nuclear furnace! furnace!)\nI'll wait around for days\nThis porch on which I pace\nCuz' I need you mine I need me yours\n\nYou stole my breath away\nYou swore to me you'd stay\nI've found something that I adore\n\nOh how\nHow are we supposed to go on?\nNot knowing if you\nBleed the way I do\nI do, well I did\nAre your bags traveling elsewhere?\nYou need to know I got the bones rolling hard against the floor\nOaoh\nAnd if you left I'd break until the little pieces fell no more, no more\n\n...\n\n"
