        "Wandering about in a universe\nBack and forth - torn\nStrandgoods of the galaxies\nBack and forth - torn\nExhausted, starved, yet still a hunter\nHidden, lurking behind some planets\nin narrow lanes, in narrow lanes\n\nDark star you are the light of my night\n...\n\n",

        "The days gone by, remembered well\nThe sound gone by without your kiss\nThe sound gone by without you...\nThe nights so long in golden rooms\nmy heart so strong in strangest mood\nmy heart so strong in strangest...\nThe voice from heaven far above\nMy eyes look up and touch you...\n\n...\n\n",
