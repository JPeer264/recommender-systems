        "Books and covers and part time lovers\nSpinning in rooms in cities of rust\nI'm stranded, struck out on this line\nThere's smoke and fire and steel and wire\nAnd glass and spire and dust\nOne to the floor at dawn with lips tied and drawn\nSleepless nights spent, with angels heaven sent\n\nStay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side\nStay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside\nLay with me, stay with me, lay with me\nStay, with me\nStay, with me\n...\n\n", 
        "You raise me up\nWhen I'm on the floor\nYou see me through\nWhen I'm lonely and scared\nAnd I'm feeling true to the written word\nAnd you're true to me\nAnd still I need more\nIt would tear me apart\nTo feel no one ever cared\nFor me\nFor me\nFor me\nYou are a tower of strength to me\n\nYou stand firm and proud\n...\n\n", 
        "Cold still waters running deep\nPale before the eyes\nRavaged\nBy the hands that feed\nThunder clouds the skies\nDrifting with the tid\nFloating with the stream\nThe howling winds have gathered strength\nFrom a wisper to a scream\nSell me down the river\nAnd out to sea\nCast me adrift and set me to sail\nJust on last kiss before raising hell\nBeyond the pale\nBeyond the pale\n...\n\n", 
        "Silver and gold and it's growing cold\nAutumn leaves lay as thick as thieves\nShivers down your spine chill you to the bone\n'cos the mandolin wind is the melody that turns your heart to stone\nThe heat of your breath carving shadows in the mist\nEvery angel has the wish that she's never been kissed\nA broken dream haunting in your sleep\nAnd hiding in your smile\nA secret you must keep, love cuts you deep\n\nLove breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel\n...\n\n", 
        "Believe in magic believe in lore legend and myth\nAnd the hand that guides in the cunning if hope in the weaving of dreams\nAnd the lady of the lake takes my hand and leads me\nTo the holy isle and the fairy rings and the circles of stone\nForever and again\n\nGive me, give me, give me, deliverance\nBrother, sister, give me, give me\nDeliverance, deliver me\n\nSurrender to the wisdom of age and the spirits of time\nRemember our souls entwined for eternity\n...\n\n", 
        "Mumbo jumbo, listen to the whispers of madness\nWe have climbed mountains of dust\nWe have seen gold gather rust\nHocus pocus the stampede of my heart\nWe have sailed on the stars through the air\nWe have flown on the wings of a prayer\nInto the blue, only with you\nInto the blue, only with you, into the blue\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Daddy says come and sit on my knee\nDaddy says you're the only girl for me\n'cos amelia, you're daddy's favourite girl\nAmelia, daddy loves his little girl\n\nDaddy comes in the dark of night\nDaddy say don't be scared, it'll be alright\nAmelia, daddy hates to see you cry\nAmelia, you're the apple of daddy's eye\n...\n\n", 
        "Every time I think of you it's like the last beat of my heart\nThe memory of leaving you is tearing me apart\nNo waves, no tears, no backward glance\nBut I'll always hold you dear\nNever regret but I'll never forget\n'cos there's not enough heaven here\n\nHands across the ocean, reaching out for you\nAcross the waves, across the water\nHands, across the ocean\nOcean\n\nAnd every time I'm missing you I just can't let it show\nAnd every time I want to cry, I just can't let it go\n...\n\n",

        "Snow blind, dog tired\nSnow blind, and barb wired\nLast chance in the jungle trance\nAnd the fast step of the monkey dance craze\nWar paint, misty days and dizzy faint\nKeeping the faith, spinning turning\nWatch the flames\nOf bridges burning\n\nTurning colours and shedding skin\n...\n\n", 
        "I see your dancing, laughing, naked, sweet and pretty face\nAnd the promise burning brightly in your crystal-shot eyes\nYour savage and violent flesh, the cut that bleeds, the kiss that stings\nWe're shooting up stars and desperate snows\nThat fall from shimmering skies\n\nSo take my hand and lead me\nTo the garden of delight\nTake my hand and lead me\nTo the garden of delight\n\nRevelation is laid and reflects on the windswept liquid mirror\n...\n\n", 
        "Books and covers and part time lovers\nSpinning in rooms in cities of rust\nI'm stranded, struck out on this line\nThere's smoke and fire and steel and wire\nAnd glass and spire and dust\nOne to the floor at dawn with lips tied and drawn\nSleepless nights spent, with angels heaven sent\n\nStay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side\nStay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside\nLay with me, stay with me, lay with me\nStay, with me\nStay, with me\n...\n\n", 
        "I gave you flowers and you gave me faith\nWe are minds and hearts that move as one\nChameleon, warrior, gypsy and brave\nTurn our eyes to the heart of the rising sun\n\nYou and me, we are blood brothers\nYou and me, we are blood brothers\nBlood brother, lay down your life for me\nLay down your love for me\n\nKiss by kiss, touch by touch\nWe talk of clouds that walked\nYou took my hand and walked me through the rain\nAn act of love, mission and tender mercy\n...\n\n", 
        "There's the crime of passion\nAnd the crime of revenge\nBut the worst crime of all\nIs the crime of regret\nSpeak of the devil\nAnd the devil may speak of you\nWhy can we\nLet sleeping dogs die\n\nDeep, it cuts deep\nAnd the affection it grows\nAnd heaven only knows\nWhat you were to earth\nAnd the giving birth\n...\n\n", 
        "Terror strewn across the floor\nFate creeps under the creaking door\nSay farewell to the solid days\nArms held out for the needle haze\nScars, scars start to show\nBut don't, don't despair for the shame I know\n\nBible for the loving damned\nReligion for the pagan man\nFaith and prayer for the chosen few\nMystic shades of violent hues\nBlood, blood on my cheeks\n...\n\n", 
        "Run you ragged\nTorn and jagged\nSharp tongued, ripped and ragged\nCouldn't find the party line\nGee whiz, it's happy time\nMirror, mirror, reflects me hazy\nThe heat's on, I'm running round crazy\nHere's the road, didn't miss a trick\nWhile you trash the punch and kick\nI'll kiss the lips that sealed your fate\nI'll bring you flowers and place them on your grave\n\nDreaming of colours, swamped in dust\nSweet dreams all covered in rust\nLooking at heaven, gladdest ghosts seen\nTurn to kill this crazy dream\nYou are revered for your work with ink and mirrors\nYou are renouned for bringing me steel and power\n...\n\n", 
        "It's no shot in the dark\nAnd no trick of the lights\nYou tease me, adore me\nTalking dirty, sitting pretty\nLay me down and annoint my wounds\nDust up, bust up, let's get down to the nitty-gritty\n\nYou call on favours promised and sworn\nChanging names and changing places\nThe blade digs deep\nAnd the cut begins to sting\nThere's more to this than reason\nOr the old familiar rhythm and rhyme\nTake me shake me lead me\nTo the floor and hey let's swing\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish for once have back all the gold delivered to those who managed to convince me that it was proof of friendship If someone take her away to what I had not I wish for once forget that I believed it was a joke That always cut a mop of noble linen and silk I wish at least once Explain what no one can understand that what happened yet to come and the future is not what it once I wish for once prove that those who have more than you need to have almost always convinces that has not enough too speak from having nothing to say I wish for once what the simplest be seen ...", 
        "Foreign tongues in familiar places\nSurrender the thrills to the very core\nForever young and blessed with nameless graces\nA love that kills and promises more\nAsh on the carpet and dust on the mirror\nChasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer\nGasping for colour, this perfect heart\n\nScreaming howl and the children play\nSerpents kiss for the words you pray\nWhiskey and the devil and the witching hour\nSerpents kiss on that untouched flower\n...\n\n", 
        "The tried and the trusted talk of plans\nMaster, past and present\nHeartless wordplay, and dreams of revenge\nLiving on the edge, the razor edge, living on the razor edge\n\nOne day we'll look back at this\nAnd laugh and laugh and we'll die laughing\nOne day we'll look back at this and laugh\n\nPillar of wisdom and soul of iron\n...\n\n"
