        "Ever since my heart took such a tumble\nI've wondered if your love for me would last\nWhen landmarks fall and institutions crumble\nWill it be just a memory of the past?\n\nWhen lovers make no rendezvous\nAnd stroll along Fifth Avenue\nWhen this familiar world is through\nWill you still be mine?\n\nWhen cabs don't drive around the park\nNo windows light the summer dark\nWhen love has lost its secret spark\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Night and stars above that shine so bright\nThe myst'ry of their fading light\nThat shines upon our caravan\n\nSleep upon my shoulder as we creep\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "", 
        "Listen to the melody entrancing\nBlending in a soft and sweet refrain\nAs around the floor, dear, we are dancing\nSwaying to a fascinating strain\n\nSweet music soft and mellow\nSoothing and slow\nStrains of a mellow 'cello\nWhen lights are low\nDear, we're so close together I love you so\nWhy think about the weather\nWhen lights are low\nTwo hearts revealing\nMusic hath charms\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
