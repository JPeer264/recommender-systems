        "A stranger came by traveling\nHe went to every door\nHe said he'd lost his people\nHe'd come to look for more\nAnd many did believe him\nAs he talked upon the square\nThe spell he wove upon us\nFills my body with despair\nAnd in his eyes\nWas the flame of the west\nUntil it burns\nHe never rests\nHe had the voice of an angel\nAnd the face of a saint\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213978)", 
        "I feel the way the wind blows\nIt tells me where you've been through\nI watch the way the sun sets\nUntil the night's inside you\nSome days I just don't worry\nI let it pour through me\nSome days I need to bury\nThe very depths of me\nSo I wait out here to the east of Eden\nI let salvation be\n\nI was waiting, I was watching\nWould it ever be there for me?\nWhen I felt that hope and a lucky card\nWere all I had to walk with me... had to walk with me\nI watch the way the crow flies\nAnd though it seems so easy\nBut if I see it in a grey sky\nCan I be sure about the way it leaves me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213978)",
