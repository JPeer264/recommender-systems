        "She's travelling\nPast darwin\n125 miles an hour\nThe weather man has warned us well\nThere's been a lot of pressure building\nClouds dark and static\nFrom the silence you might never tell\nBut we're in for a drama\n\nSci-clone\nTearing down the city\nLike a savage\nShe's a sci-clone\nDust for clothing\nLife for baggage\n\nStay underground\nSafe and sound\n\nBut if I feel like running\nBest you stay out of my way\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Walking down leafy lane\nIn a shady dream\nPeople pass me by\nFinding reason for flight\nBut I don't feel that keen\nWhen the spark in your eye\nStarts to fade\nIt's just what you needed\nLazy acres\nUnder my feet\nNearly found myself wishing\nYou were there\n\nReaching out for me\nWaiting for the breeze\nWaiting for the breeze\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
