        "Is this the time and place?\nThe day I knew would come?\nThe very last embrace\nUnited as we part\n\nThe loneliest of looks\nA smile that I adore\nI turn around to go\nFeel shaken to the core\n...\n\n", 
        "Watch the shore\nAs the tide will never end\nFeel the wind\nAs the clouds will breathe your name\n\nOur faces pale and thin\nEmbraces cold and bare\nWe whisper lullabies\nSo tearful as we glare\n\nWhen old companions say:\n...\n\n", 
        "I find myself sinking\nDrowning in the past\nWhat is the cause of pain?\nAnd what is meant to last?\n\nI sleep in your stories\nHiding in the dark\nI have to calm down again\nLet me please feel save at night\n\nStop pushing me away\nI'm blinded and I'm lost\nToo many lines been crossed\nAnd you're a little late\n\nIn the depth of this moment\n...\n\n", 
        "Echo in me\n\nA creature like you is born for defeat\nYou lure me to places where giants sleep\n\nSchlaf, schlaf...\n...\n\n", 
        "Can you not feel the remorse (you make me hate myself)\nLike a gathering storm (you make me hate myself)\nIt is time to let go (you make me hate myself)\nWhat a tempting remedy (you make me hate myself)\n\nIt is time to let go\nYou make me hate myself\n...\n\n", 
        "A childish dream\n\nSacrifice - surrender\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The sky ranges the past\nEnclosed in ancient walls\nCaptured in memories\nA kingdom to survive\nImmortal silence gathers illusions inside\nI see the desert sand\nWhirled up by the feet of war\nA mournful eye in isolation\nBlinded by a silent spell\n...\n\n", 
        "To the sound of your laughter\nTo the sound of your cries\nDecays within silence\nIn the depth of your eyes\n\nNumb expectations in my shattering voice\n...\n\n", 
        "Ancient sights to slave his longings\nLost and captive between two worlds\nHave you seen this place before?\nHave you seen my fields of joy?\n\nBut within his eyes the beauty fading\nSacrificed my life of lies\n...\n\n", 
        "Have you felt the forgiveness\nHe has spread across the land?\nHave you felt the dignity\nIn each of the people's heads?\nBut have you also seen the pain\nOr did he give you eyes in vain?\nDiseases, wars and shattered pride\nAnd a nation dressed in black\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Viscious words and false belief\nChains around my wrists\nA sad sensation\nThe craving for life is gone\nIntoxicate me in the trot of life\nA yelling laugh decays my dream\nA laugh to fear my deed\n...\n\n", 
        "Eyes in silence\nEyes in the dark\nA life in patience\nTo survive and surrender\nWhatever I feel\nWhatever I see is just\nA sign of hope\nA reflection of my memories\nWords covered with dust\nIn a book to my left\nAn urge to read\nNo permission\nHelpless eyes\nVoices fading\nI regret\n...\n\n", 
        "And I meander in mortal lanes of festering\nBut still my childish instincts bloom\nScreaming out my soul to the rhythm of the pendulum\nDroplets of despair - apparition distorted\n\n...\n\n", 
        "To conquer the angel's laugh\nAn urge implied\nA captious offer in your hands\nMy hymne of praise denied\nDisguising, fading scarlet of your belief\nDrowning gently in commands\nIt's your defeat\n\nMephisto, my fallen angel\n...\n\n", 
        "Monuments of grace\nDischarge my credits\nThe future is my past\nTake a risk - survive\n\nFortunate belief\nEnter - communicate\nContrasts - black and white\n...\n\n", 
        "And have you seen\nThrough the curtain of my life?\nGet down to the rescue -\nFor my shelter - mental incest\n\nArchaic disciples\nOffer their support\nBut who to fuck am I to dare to accept?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Autumn leaves are falling\nA kingdom left behind\nAimless steps in silence\nMy crutches fall\n\nI crawl along this path\nA stare - possessed\nI cannot remain conscious\nI sink to the ground\n\n...\n\n", 
        "O'angels come to guide me in my sacred land\nThine holy glance enlights my chamber\nStranger worlds in fractal thoughts\nA gentle thrill\nI'm crowned with thorns\nWho will remember this?\nQuiet doms of whispering circling in my head\nCollapsing mental boundries\nDraconic lips of mine\nAnd angels still corrupting with a silent word of wisdom\nO'angels find their sacred land\n...\n\n", 
        "Immortal hatred longing\nFor what I've done to you\nA shattered dream of greed\nConfess of a faded bloom\n\nReminded day by day\nThe scars just cannot heal\nStill unforgiven guilt\nAm I a child within your hands?\n...\n\n", 
        "Crucified in my mortal chamber\nBegging eyes deceive my strength\nStumbling feet into horizons\nTear - stained cheeks taint my soul\n\nIn cold deceit\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Enemies adorned by childish innocence\nDictators rule\nGranted words you offer\nI urge to spread wings of decay\n\nBridges fall to split the nation\nWalls enrise for better days to please\nDraining ditch - water from my eyes\nRetaliate\n\nA veil of mystery I feel\nBlindfold in obscurity\nIn the shade of a tree\n...\n\n", 
        "Just give me nails\nTo be my burden\n\nCrucified emotions struggle to survive\nAnd the truth, she has not heard for long\n\nCold and bare, but sacred?\nWho has the guts to spread such lies\n\n...\n\n", 
        "And the place was burning\nWhere once my cradle stood\nMemories still yearning\nFor what my childhood took\n\nIn peaceful shelter I may rest\nJust instincts of salvation\nO'deviate from the within\nBut hate I may not feel\n\nA nations decay within my eyes\nImploring still in vague seclusion\nA tear from a child's eye- obeying still\nBut fate just ties together\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Raindrops fall to cleanse my soul\nThe song of whales tear me apart\nMy eyes still stray along this shore\nA seagulls` plaint adoring mine \nMy tongue too weak to speak a word\nO` was I born to be misunderstood \nFingers touch, but do not feel\nO` tired seem my restless eyes\nSo tired is my smile\nIn my endless depth of guilt \nA cripple of my fear \nAnd the needle serves me well\n...\n\n"
