        "It's such a funny sensation to be\nSo happy that you want to die\nPromises always were crazy to me\nBut never was I so surprised\nMinutes are longer when we are apart\nYour presence more than I can handle\nIt's come to the point where I wonder if I\nCould ever be luckier when\n\nSuddenly I'm back at the core\nThinking of her who had you before\nWere you as good, as good as we are\nDo you remember\nDid you love her the way you love me\nIs there a chance that there might be\nTraces of her that you carry\nUnder the surface\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "You say, we must move forward\nAnd I say, let's not go back\nOnce we were brave explorers\nBut this trail is a worn-out track\nDon't chase that setting sun\nLook what we've become \n\nDon't save me, I'll save you the hassle\nOur little castle is a house of cards\nIt's empty, heartache is pending\nThis is us ending \n\nYou say, you were just kidding\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",
