        "Dark as roses, and fine as sand\nI feel your healing and your sting again\nI hear you laughing and my soul is saved\nOn forgotten graves you cry\n\nCrawl like ivy up my spine\nThrough my nerves and into my eyes\nCuts like anguish or\nRecollections of better days gone by\n\nBut it's alright\nWhen you're all in pain\nAnd you feel the rain come down\nOh, it's alright\nWhen you find your way\nThen you see it disappear\nOh, it's alright\nThough your garden's grey\nI know all your graces\n...\n\n",

        "Words get tangled on your tongue and you stumble on your feet\nWhen you miss somebody\nAnd everywhere you think you see them walking down the street\nWhen you miss somebody\nWhen you miss somebody\nYou tell yourself a hundred thousand times\nNobody ever lives forever so you give it one more try\nTo wave goodbye\nWave goodbye\n\n...\n\n",

        "Sweet Euphoria mine is the heart you own\nYou lost the grace of the hands that harmed you\nIn the daze of a thousand yawns\nLost my love, as it is I'm truly gone\nIn your morning I will sleep\nFire on an open palm\nDeath for Jesus and plastic armies\nWouldn't bring me back again\nSweet as ether eyes I'm blind to them\n...\n\n", 
        "What have you done, my little spark?\nCursing my name 'cause again I put you out\nFalling apart, you tell yourself you are\nDreaming only of the ones who never dream of you\nNever dreaming of you\n\nBut I'm your disappearing one\nVanish when the curtain's drawn\nBut I will come again, and you will let me in\n...\n\n"
