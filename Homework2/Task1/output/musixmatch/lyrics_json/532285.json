        "Yo, Ay man, you know I ain't perfect\u2026 Nobody is. No I stand to be corrected\nI know one thing for certain though, these super men, these supermen don't exist bro\nGod exists\n\nThis ain't no ordinary story, with the hardships and glory\nLet me take you deeper into the mind of a child of a bitch with addictions and a wish-list\nDear Father, can I get a man and a big ol' house?\nLots of money and did I mention lots of money?\nFunny how the world turns on me\nMe and Mama was all alone\nWanted for the life that we once called home\nTrying to get a grip on life gone wrong\nYoung Yelawolf, to tell the truth I came out just fine\nGuess that's why half of the people around me growing up said I lost my mind\nBut I just lost the time with friends instead the victim of crime\nTouched by the demon's lust and lost my innocence before 5\nMolested, forgive my confessions, I'm an open book\nGrowing up to hate pentagrams on my seat in class no open book\nI dreamed of a gangsta life\nAny excuse to let go of this hurt\nMy folks were atheists, so I couldn't let go in the church\nAnybody who wanted it from me I would back down I was scared\nI didn't know how to win\nBack then all I could do was dream about being Superman\n\nOh, Oh you're looking at the sky watching Superman fly\nAround the whole world while it's falling apart\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
