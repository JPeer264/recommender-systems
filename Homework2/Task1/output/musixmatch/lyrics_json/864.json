        "When i first saw you\nYou had on blue jeans\nYour eyes couldn't hide\nAnything\nI saw you\nBreathing, oh\nSaw you staring out in space\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Now I want someone badly\nGot a girl here tonight\nWant someone new, someone new\nBut a little cry wants someone badly\nWanna know if this is a bad lease on me\n\nI want to know\nAm I sure that I heard you right\n...\n\n", 
        "There's the moon asking to stay\nLong enough for the clouds to fly me away\nOh, it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die\n\nMy fading voice sings of love\nBut she cries to the clicking of time\nOf time\n\nWait in the fire\nWait in the fire\n\nWait in the fire\nWait in the fire\nFire\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I heard there was a secret chord\nThat David played and it pleased the Lord\nBut you don't really care for music, do you?\n\nWell it goes like this the fourth, the fifth\nThe minor fall and the major lift\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah\n\nWell your faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\n\nShe tied you to her kitchen chair\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm\nThis body will never be safe from harm\nStill feel your hair, black ribbons of coal\nTouch my skin to keep me whole\n\nIf only you'd come back to me\nIf you laid at my side\nWouldn't need no mojo pin\nTo keep me satisfied\n\nDon't want to weep for you\nI don't want to know\nI'm blind and tortured\nThe white horses flow\nThe memories fire\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost\nFor a life of sin I have paid the cost\nWhen I walk by all the people say\nJust another guy on the lost highway\n\nJust a deck of cards and a jug of wine\n...\n\n", 
        "This is our last goodbye\nI hate to feel the love between us die\nBut it's over\nJust hear this and then I'll go\nYou gave me more to live for\nMore than you'll ever know\n\nThis is our last embrace\nMust I dream and always see your face\nWhy can't we overcome this wall\nBaby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all\n...\n\n", 
        "Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners\nParading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water\nAnd maybe I'm too young\nTo keep good love from going wrong\nBut tonight you're on my mind so you'll never know\n\nI'm broken down and hungry for your love\nWith no way to feed it\nWhere are you tonight?\nChild, you know how much I need it\n\nToo young to hold on\nAnd too old to just break free and run\n\nSometimes a man gets carried away\nWhen he feels like he should be having his fun\nMuch too blind to see the damage he's done\n...\n\n", 
        "It's been such a long time\nAnd I was just a child then\nWhat will you say\nWhen you see my face?\nTime feels like it's flown away\nThe days just pass and fade away\nWhat will you say\nWhen they take my place?\n\nIt's funny now\nI just don't feel like I'm a man\nWhat will you say\nWhen you see my face?\nMy face...\n\nMother dear, the world's gone cold\nNo one cares about love anymore\n...\n\n", 
        "This is our last goodbye\nI hate to feel the love between us die\nBut it's over\nJust hear this and then I'll go\nYou gave me more to live for\nMore than you'll ever know\n\nThis is our last embrace\nMust I dream and always see your face\nWhy can't we overcome this wall\nBaby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all\n...\n\n", 
        "This is our last goodbye\nI hate to feel the love between us die\nBut it's over\nJust hear this and then I'll go\nYou gave me more to live for\nMore than you'll ever know\n\nThis is our last embrace\nMust I dream and always see your face\nWhy can't we overcome this wall\nBaby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all\n...\n\n", 
        "Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch\nAnd remember the smell of the fabric\nOf your simple city dress\n\nOh, that was so real\nOh, that was so real\nOh, that was so real\n\nWe walked around 'til the moon got full like a plate\nThe wind blew an invocation, could have fell asleep at the gaze\nAnd I never stepped on the cracks 'cause I knew I'd lose my mother\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a child sleeping near his twin,\nThe pictures go wild in a rush of wind.\nThat dark angel, he is shuffling in,\nWatching over them with his black feather wings unfurled.\n\nThe love you lost with her skin so fair,\nIs free with the wind in her butterscotch hair.\nHer green eyes bloom goodbyes,\nWith her head in her hands and your kiss on the lips of another.\nDream brother,\nWith your tears scattered round the world.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost\nFor a life of sin I have paid the cost\nWhen I walk by all the people say\nJust another guy on the lost highway\n\nJust a deck of cards and a jug of wine\nAnd a woman's lies makes a life like mine\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm\nThis body will never be safe from harm\nStill feel your hair, black ribbons of coal\nTouch my skin to keep me whole\n\nIf only you'd come back to me\nIf you laid at my side\nWouldn't need no mojo pin\nTo keep me satisfied\n\nDon't want to weep for you\nI don't want to know\nI'm blind and tortured\nThe white horses flow\nThe memories fire\n...\n\n", 
        "Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch\nAnd remember the smell of the fabric\nOf your simple city dress\n\nOh, That was so real\nOh, That was so real\nOh, That was so real\n\nWe walked around til the moon got full like a plate\nThe wind blew an invocation\nAnd I fell asleep at the gate\nAnd I never stepped on the cracks\n...\n\n"
