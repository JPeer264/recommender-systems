        "2015 Hard shove, feel the heavy weight\nIt's the same love that I push away\nIt be the same thing I always debate\nWhy you left me here for another\nThese days I tend to see red\n'cause all the women swimming in my head\nAre not the same ones laying in my bed\nBut I do my best to ignore it\n\nBut you still come up\n\nIt's all in my head, there's not much I can do\nYou set your pace, I'll keep mine too\nEach time I chase, I feel dark blue\nConfuse your face for someone new\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "So sing to me, let me be your harshest critic\nLet me point out your mistakes\nAnd tell you you're a fake\nAnd let the chips fall where they may\n\nIn a perfect world there will be no one to judge you\nYour lack of ink will be the thing that kills you\nFollow the leader to the bank\n\nCongratulate, yourself for fooling everyone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Looking across the park at midnight i see you run away\nYou can't hide your tears from you\nAs i told you, as i said so many times, i'm sorry\nI know sometimes it's not enough, these words cut through like daggers\nEvery single time, they're better left unsaid\n\nWhere are you going\nOur night can't end like this\nLeave it to me to say the wrong thing\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Adolescence spent in your shadow\nNow you wonder why I turned out like this, it's hereditary\nA knee jerk reaction gives way to another argument\n\nAnother endless fight\nI don't care who is wrong or right\nThe role passed down I'm not assuming\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
