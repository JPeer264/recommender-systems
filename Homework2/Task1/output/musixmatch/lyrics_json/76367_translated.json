        "When I was young I mimicked my father\nI followed his shadow in the street\nI would lie awake for hours\nListening to Flow's (?) Creek\n\nI was hynotized by his deep voice\nand the way him and my mother would speak\nIn quiet hushed voices\nIn words I don't understand\nTalking well into the warm dark night\nTouching my head with their hands\n\nNow I'm older\nand I'm affected\nI'm not as genuine as I let on\n\nAnd I lie to her like it's nothing at all\nSome call it leading her on\nWell we talk late at night\nI tell her I might be in love\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I walked through walls to be with you\nIn the early nighttime morning came so soon\nAnd on Thursday night New York glowed\nI was in your arms black water flowed\n\nAnd if you were told\nWould you ever know\n\nDo you see me tonight\nWith the coins on my eyes\nLove's sweet surprise\nThe light upon your face\nAnd all the lovers at war\nThat roll down the line\nLove felt so fine\nThe light upon your face\n...\n\n", 
        "Late in the summer children run without clothes\nChill of the winter not far down the road\nAnd in the windows are silhouettes of husbands and wives\nWatching in silence till the evening arrives\nAnd there all around insects scream in the trees\nThe promise of rain can be heard on the breeze\n\nOh lord we break so easy\nOh lord we shatter like glass\n...\n\n", 
        "I walked through walls to be with you\nIn the early nighttime morning came so soon\nAnd on Thursday night New York glowed\nI was in your arms black water flowed\n\nAnd if you were told\nWould you ever know\n\nDo you see me tonight\nWith the coins on my eyes\nLove's sweet surprise\nThe light upon your face\nAnd all the lovers at war\nThat roll down the line\nLove felt so fine\nThe light upon your face\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah like an ugly James Dean, I was waiting for you\nBut I was never what you were looking for\nYeah I remember all the days I tasted you on my lip\nI was in a haze, I was in a haze\n\nOh you know it's so hard to let you go\nI'm feeling so down, yeah I was low\nI leave it to die and then divide\nKiss me goodbye, kiss me goodbye\n\nNow baby make the bed, just destroy it again\n...\n\n", 
        "We're back there and the heartbreak came\nYeah it hit me pretty hard\nI waved hello and goodbye\nTo the ghosts on the boulevard\n\nWell oh, oh my baby\nYour so sweet it makes me cry\nWell oh, oh my baby\nYour so sweet it makes me cry\n\nYour so sweet, your so sweet\nYour so sweet, i wanna cry\n\nLa, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la\n\nLa, la, la, la, la,\nLa, la, la, la, la\n\nWell i dealt with the dog face hunny\nJust try to sympathize\nWell he turned and looked at me\n...\n\n",

        "Oh, let me carry your bags\nLet me lighten your load\nAnd let me mellow your mind\nAs we drive down the road\n\nYeah oh, Lady Memphis let me ride\nYour beautiful slide guitar suicide\nYou know, I'll find you baby, don't try to hide\nYou know, love is true and it ain't no lie\n\nTell me how it feels\nYou tell me how it feels\nYou tell me how it feels\nYou tell me how it\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Behind The Frontlines\n\nBlue light of morning palm trees in rows\nThe end of my affair with the west coast\nI was already dressed when she opened her mouth\nAnd decided to give up the ghost\nHelicopters the coast guard and radar screens\nAll the haunted and lonely technology\nI'll cut all my times with the dead and the dying\nI have been wasting my time\nIn need of a substance to steady my hands\nI'm gonna make the most of this day's plans\nFalling in love with the shivering engines\nFalling in love with the prettiest sound\n...\n\n", 
        "You started over yesterday\nIn dirty rain, the sky was so gray\nYou listen to the engine sing\nAnd you forget about everything\n\nLet the sun shine\nLike it's never shined\nAcross a blue sky\nAnd watch the time fly\n\nFree all the lonely boys who loves no one\nAnd dream on through the years\nAnd leave the light on\n...\n\n", 
        "No love\nNo love\nStop right where you are\n\nYeah, there's no use pretending\nThere's nothing left to see\nBelow, love\nBelow, love\nOur little window\nYeah, there's the sound of shouting\nExplosions in the street\n\nSo sleep well tonight, my dear\n...\n\n",
