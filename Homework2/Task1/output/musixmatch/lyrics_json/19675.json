        "Talking: The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle\nof the night and somebody in yo room. Yo heart starts beating so fast\nyou can hear it pumping. The veins in yo temple pulsate as you stare at\nthe intruder. Then after a few minutes you realize he ain't moving. So\nfinally you let 'em hang and turn on the light and the killer turns into\nyo coat throwed over the chair.\n\nThe feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning and two or\nthree motherfuckers cross the street. Yo senses heighten, reflexes\nsharpen vision's enhanced adrenaline flows as they rush across the\nstreet you leave the print from the heater grip in yo palm then yo heart\nrate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just\ngoin' to the store.\n\nMany of us mistake Phobia for true fear. Whereas fear is a gift from\nGod to be used for self-preservation. Phobia are obstacles strategically\nplaced in society by opposers of positive existence. Through\nstereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification they'll\nturn your fear switch to a permanent on. We can change this by changing\nthe small truth within' the lie. Death is a small price to pay for\nrespect. Death is a small price to pay for respect. You know who it is.\nYou know what it is.
