        "This lovely day will lengthen into evening\nWe'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had\nAlone where we have walked together\nI'll remember April and be glad\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Old black magic has me in its spell\nOld black magic that you weave so well\nThose icy fingers up and down my spine\nThe same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine\nSame old tingle that I feel inside\nThen the elevator starts it ride\n\nDown and down I go\nRound and round I go\nLike a leaf caught in a tide\nI should stay away but what can I do\nI hear your name and I'm a flame\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't worry I'm not looking at you\nGorgeous and dressed in blue\nDon't worry I'm not looking at you\nGorgeous and dressed in blue\nI know it drives you crazy\nWhen I pretend you don't exist\nWhen I'd like to lean in close\nAnd run my hands against your lips\nThough we haven't even spoken\nStill I sense there's a rapport\nSo whisper me your number\n...\n\n", 
        "Miles Davis - flugelhorn\nBernie Glow - Lead trumpet\nErnie Royal - Trumpets\nLouis Mucci - Trumpets\nTaft Jordan - Trumpets\nJohn Carisi - Trumpets\n...\n\n",
