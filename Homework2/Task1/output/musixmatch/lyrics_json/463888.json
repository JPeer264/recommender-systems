        "Here we stand\nWorld's apart, hearts broken in two, two, two\nSleepless nights\nLosing ground\nI'm reaching for you, you, you\n\nFeelin' that it's gone\nCan change your mind\nIf we can't go on\nTo survive the tide love divides\n\nSomeday love will find you\nBreak those chains that bind you\nOne night will remind you\nHow we touched\n...\n\n", 
        "There's no use in crying\nAll my tears won't drown my pain\nStreaming from your sorrow\nI can't grieve you again\n\nI watched you let yourself die\nAnd now it's too late to save you this time\n\nYou bury me alive\nAnd everybody's gotta breath somehow\nDon't leave me die\nToo consumed by your own emptiness and lies\n\nAll I did was love you\nNow I hate the nightmare you've become\nI can't let you fool me\n...\n\n",

        "I can feel your fingers\nWhen I close my eyes\nTake your poison love inside\nI fall into dreaming\nI've been waiting for your touch to bring me home\nSleeping death will come and lead me out of the sunlight\n\nShadows pulling me to lie with you\nWhen the moonlight sings\nThe darkness brings me back to die with you\nI'd give it all away to be with you\nMy hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Falling to my knees before you,\nSo ashamed to see my weakness fill your eyes,\nNeedlessly, I let myself stray before you,\nNow I face the consequence of my betrayal.\n\nMy paradigm, my sweet love I breathe,\nIt's you I rely on,\nShelter me from cold, I die in paradigm.\n\nDo we sacrifice, let our story die?\n...\n\n", 
        "You won't go away,\nThese aching memories still dance around me,\nSpilling over everything with beauty,\nI see your face in everything before me\nYour voice is hunting me.\n\nOh I belong with you now,\nOh please give in to me,\nAnd stay forever,\n...\n\n",

        "Tonight I'll wait for you,\nThe raindrops are falling,\nThe kindle is burning,\nFor you, I'll be waiting here.\n\nIf all of the days, have no more light,\nAnd all of our dreams are lost tonight,\nThe stars cannot fall,\nAnd everything turns to grey,\nI will stay.\n\nGraceful and loving\n...\n\n",

        "Memories fade into the silence\nHaunting me tonight\nWith hopes last breath\nI take this moment in\nIt will be the last\nWhen morning breaks and sunlight takes the pain away\n\nEver after never came, and I'm still waiting\nFor a life that never was\nAnd all the dreams that I laid to rest\nAre ghosts that keep me\nAfter all that I've become\nI am only one\nI am only one\n\n...\n\n"
