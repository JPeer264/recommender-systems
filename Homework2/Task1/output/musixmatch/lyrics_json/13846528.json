        "I've been crushed beaten down\nAnd I'm frozen to the ground\nLike a fool I've trusted you\nStill I'm hopelessly in love\n\nI never thought that I would be this helpless\nI can't believe I'm giving in for you\nI've been crushed, I've had enough\n\nNow I wanna leave but I'm lost\nSo now I can't break away\nAlthough I've made up my mind\nMy heart is refusing me\n(heeey yeaah eeeey eeeey)\nMy heart is refusing me\n...\n\n",
