        "There's no sense, the fire burns\nWhen wisdom fails, it changes all\nThe wheel embodies all that keeps on turning\n\nBlood red skies, I feel so cold\nNo innocence\nWe play our roll\nThe wheel embodies all\nWhere are we going?\n\nAll in all\nYou expect the wise to be wiser\nFallen from grace and\nAll and all I guess we should have known\nBetter 'cause\n\nWhat about us\nIsn't it enough\nNo we're not in paradise\nThis is who we are\nThis is what we've got\nNo it's not our paradise\nBut it's all we want\nAnd it's all that we're fighting for\nThought it's not paradise\n\nYou and us, or I and them\nThere comes a time to take a stand\nThe wheel is watching all\nIt keeps on burning\n...\n\n",

        "I'm the one who leaves shadows\nIn your room at night\nI'm the reason you're listening\nEnlightening your eyes\n\nWhen Pan meets Apollo\nDown with the sin\nThey will send tears of angels\nThough kindness won't win\n\nLost Northern star\nBuried in sorrow\nI'll guard your mind\nLet demons howl outside\n\n...\n\n",

        "It's getting hard to breathe\nDarkness in my head frightens me\nThere's a little devil in my mouth\nWriting ugly words for you to shout\nThe virgin soul that lived in me\nIs raped by insecurity\nI need you to sing\n\nSing for me my love\nSing the right from wrong\nHere inside my mind\n...\n\n",
