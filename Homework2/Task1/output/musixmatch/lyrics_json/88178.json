        "So cold, So Cold, so lonely Inside of me\nBut a fire is burning to set me free\nWhere is the shelter that will warm my soul\nWho can save me before I am lost\nWho can save me before I am lost\n\nMisted by desire we chase the wind\nA pearl in the oyster of the night\nOur soul rides the wave of light\n...\n\n", 
        "\"The Ancient Dance Of Qetesh\"\n\nWish there were another world to choose\nWish all hatred could just disappear\nWish the shade that covers my hopes\nWould not be there\n\nThe dance of Qetesh\nMoves like a snake\n...\n\n", 
        "Mordor\nJoin in the dream\nFeel the magic\nWise man`s words find the sunstone\nMake the night to day\nAlong the way a sword with a spell\n...\n\n", 
        "Everyday ends\nand the time surrenders\nLost dreams forgotten\nFeelings got faded\nTry to sail peaceful\nthrough the night\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Lost in the eyes filled with greed\nHeart is bleeding\nAll help needing\nWind is blowing\nThe sun is burning\nTheir way is a lie\n...\n\n", 
        "Take me to paradise let me be free\nLead me through fire\nSailing on the open sea\n\nIn the rising sun a promise\nhad been done to be kept\nWith the wings of an angel\n...\n\n", 
        "The day has come and the world\nis waiting in the open\nA timeless stream of violence is written on the walls\nThe endless has reached\nout its final destiny\nAnd the hope of man has gone\ninto a dreamers mind\n\nCan you see those eyes of falling faith\nCan you sense the smell of non believe\nWill you realize when it`s time to die\nCan you feel the need to stay awake\n\nInto the point of no return\nThe day is new and the world appears\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a secret garden in the morning mist\nFilled with red roses\nHope the sun will clear the shades\nSo the secret garden of love can show its beauty\n\nWind through the trees you sang\n...\n\n",
