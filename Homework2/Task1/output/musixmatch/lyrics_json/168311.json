        "You are the reason why I despise the world\nBut still you're the only reason why I'm still in it\nTime never healed my wounds\nIt just made them more infected\nThey talk about their heartache\nBut I got a fucking heart-attack\n\nI can't reach my mind\nI can't reach my heart\nWhy can't I leave you behind\n...\n\n", 
        "Walking the Elysian fields \nfrom the tree the snake watches you \nCan you feel your dying heart \nit can no longer stand the temptation \n\nWipe out the flashbacks \nfrom the depths of my caved in heart \nTrample my utopia \nMemories force my mind to tear apart\n\nWe both ate from the serpent's tree \nI cannot blame us for burning all the bridges \nClose that coffin, strike the last nail\nand tell me why is my soul this frail\n\nYou said you'd be far away\n...\n\n", 
        "Solitude brought us together, guidanced by the hand of fate\nToo blind to see what this alignment would utterly create\n\nFrantic searching for the star I couldn\u00b4t find\nTainted hearts pound even harder to remind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "A forsaken threat\nGod failed to foresee\nCrossing forbidden boundaries\nThey'll siege the key\nBrooding in the rift\nWhere hellfire licks\nThirst for ancient vengeance\nThe end of their grievance\n\nMarching across the purgatory fields\n...\n\n", 
        "Blasphemy in your eyes, spare me your pathetic lies\nSympathy I despise, just give me your chaos cries\nOne night he came to me and spoke the words of heresy\nOne day I will prevail, in other words your last day\n\nYou and I are living a lie\n...\n\n", 
        "You cut my wings and throw me out\nOut to the land, my soul was harvested from\n\nI have never done anything to you\nYou never made my dreams come true\nBut this deceit will cost you all\nI have never, never believed in you...\n\nIf you are my Abel\n...\n\n", 
        "The artifact within my grasp\nLiberator of your mind\nLeft behind from the past\nA relic of doom\n\nTerror of the soul, sleeper awake\nRebreed into power, a mind crime beyond belief\n\nNephilims hear my cries\nReturn of the exiled breed, back from oblivion\nThey will bring\n\nDamnation upon the world we're living in\nAnnihilation beneath the banner of Hell\nIncinerate all innocence\n...\n\n", 
        "Searching in the ruins of me,\nlooking for answers\nEven though I'm all alone\nlike an terminal cancer\n\nI raise my fist into the sky\nAnd realize it was all a lie\nYou never told me, always lying\nThe truth was that you were dying...\n\nFather is she with you?\nBeware I'm coming too...\n\nIt's always hard to lose someone that you love\nBut in the end you will always be free to meet the ones above\n...\n\n", 
        "She was the night, night of retribution\nA persona not right, blood of pollution\nHe was the day, day of solution\nShaped like clay, he was led astray\n\nI WOULD DIE FOR YOU, IF YOU CARE FOR ME\nTOMORROW THERE'S ANOTHER CRIMSON DAWN\n...\n\n", 
        "I feel the eye staring through my restless dreams\nIn the end a shade of dark blue always gleams\nI don't know if it's just me\nBut I feel you watch me every night\n\nBlack leaves with shades of blue\nThe flower we found long ago\nAt your grave it withered away\nHand in hand with my soul's decay\n...\n\n", 
        "Solitude brought us together, guidance by the hand of fate\nToo blind to see what this alignment would utterly create\nFrantic searching for the star I couldn't find\nTainted hearts pound even harder to remind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Searching in the ruins of me, looking for answers\nEven though I'm all alone like an terminal cancer\nI raise my fist into the sky\nAnd realize it was all a lie\nYou never told me, always lying\nThe truth was that you were dying...\n\nFather is she with you?\nBeware I'm coming too...\n\nIT'S ALWAYS HARD TO LOSE SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE\nBUT IN THE END YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FREE TO MEET THE ONES ABOVE\nDAMAGE IS DONE BUT NOTHING IS IN VAIN\nYOU WILL WALK TOGHETER AGAIN AND FORGET THE PAIN\n...\n\n", 
        "She was the night, night of retribution\nA persona not right, blood of pollution\nHe was the day, day of solution\nShaped like clay, he was led astray\n\nI would die for you if you care for me\nTomorrow there's another crimson dawn\nI'll watch it alone upon the lost throne\n...\n\n"
