        "The shallow voice of the wind cries between these ebony wings\nThe shallow cries of the wind sing a swansong for mankind\n\nShine on morning skyfire\nablaze this final day\nThe autumnal end, the dawn of man\n...\n\n", 
        "She is the dark one...\nAs a bird I watched her from my cold tower in the heavens\nand when she fell from the northplace, I flew down and embraced her\n...\n\n", 
        "Agalloch\n...\n\n", 
        "Kiss me coldly and drain this life from my lips\nLet the cold blood flow on it's own...\nKiss me coldly and fall away from the soul\nLong forgotten...\n\nFrom which of this oak shall I hang myself?\nThese ebon halls are always dark...\nFrom which frostbitten bough shall I die?\n\nAs dark as the winter, as black as her ghastly veil\nAs cold as her whisper and chilling gown\n...\n\n", 
        "There lies a beauty behind forbidden wooden doors\nA beauty so rare and pure, it would make human eyes bleed and burn...\n\n...She killed herself in the fall...\n\nI am the unmaker, I bring death to the beautiful dawn\nWith pillor, cold, and a legion of dying angels...\n\n...I killed myself in the spring...\n...\n\n", 
        "It was in this haunted place under a moonless cloak of ebony\nI was drawn to the glow of a young spiritess weeping in the woods\n\nThe blackest ravens and ice-veiled boughs\nHave spoken of you, goddess of these bleak woods\nI yearn for your embrace, spiritess of the melancholia\nShow me, again, your sweet face\nEnchant me with your rich, cinder burnt ether\nLure me into your arms and bless unto me eternal death\n\n...\n\n"
