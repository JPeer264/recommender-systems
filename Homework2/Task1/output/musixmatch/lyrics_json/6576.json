        "Walking out of England thinking you were king\nTaking on this world, on that bus that goes through Mexico\nA killer love finds a sweet Mexican girl\nBut in Mississippi we rushed into the room\n\nDown in Dixie you were crying for dope\nDown in Alabama, they like home cooked fare, yeah\nSo we're gonna strap you to the frying chair, yeah\n\nBut I don't know what love is\nIs there something else giving me the chills?\nBut if my hands are the color of blood\nThen baby, I can tell ya, sure I can tell ya\nLove kills, kills, love kills, kills\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Dal e mi soula, y me incuerdo\nDid you see my family?\nWe had a sweet simple glory\nWe had a gallant who works for me\nFor I was once an immortal\nWith General Walker's gringo army\nYeah, I was once an immortal\nWith William Walker's gringo army\nMust be seven years that I followed him\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Chop down the cherry trees on Mango Street\nThat's the council for you every week\nI'm just the kind of seafaring guy\nWho waits for the tide and the town to get high\nI don't like to do a drop of work\nDrive a cab nor paint the church\nIt's been the same since I don't know when\nSo I'm going island hopping again\nBeen the same since I don't know when\nBut I'm going island hopping again\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Nobody really thinks about you when you're gone... no no no no\nNo kind memories linger on\nIn fact far better to get up and go out in the morning\nYou know, choose another funky downtown cholo vest\nGoing out in the morning\n\nAnd there's somebody making sandwiches in the deli\nAnd you're wondering to yourself how many pickles can you put in\nIs it really really really so bad\nIhe intellectual daft that you dug\nThat you wanna let it call yourself in\nThat's what I said\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
