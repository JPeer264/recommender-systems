        "I borrowed, I borrowed, I begged for, forgiveness\nI borrowed, I begged for, forgiveness\nI borrowed, I begged for, forgive...\n\nThe taste of blood in my mouth, is telling me to stop,\nand walk away, stop and walk away,\nAnd I don't think this thing will end,\nNot until one, of us is dead, one, of us is dead,\nBlow for blow, I take it in,\nOne last step, that extra mile\n\nPull no punches, half-hearted glances,\nLook to kill, coz you won't see this chance again,\nPull no punches, half-hearted glances,\nCoz the day we quit, is the day we die\n\nPull no punches, half-hearted glances,\n...\n\n", 
        "A thousand times I've waited,\nI've burned out.\nFlushed with hearts\nI turn back after the fall\nYeah we'll watch them burn\n\nAshes slip through your fingers\nWhile you try to grasp what once was yours\nBut your cries fall on deaf ears\nPlay with matches and people burn.\n\nA thousand times I've waited,\nI've burned out.\n...\n\n", 
        "Rain down! Rain down!\nLet it cut to the bone\nRain down! Rain down!\nJust like my words to you\nRain down! Rain down!\nLet these wounds never heal\nRain down! Rain down!\nYeah my heart always bleeds\n\nThrough the rain and tears\nYour eyes hide from me\nBecause they now see\ntruth in disbelief\nSo I take my knife\nfrom your bleeding heart\nturn it on myself\nand I slit my throat\n\nTo bleed like you breathe\nSlowly drowning\nTo feel the rain\nCut deep\n...\n\n", 
        "I can see a war, burning in your eyes\nI've whored myself for less than this,\nYou gotta sh-sh-shake on it.\nWe will never fall, never stand aside\nI've whored myself for less than this,\nYou gotta sh-sh-shake on it.\n\nWe've come to far,\nYou'll never take our souls alive\nI've come for you\nWe will, WE WILL SURVIVE!\nI've come so far,\nSo take your poison dressed in wine\nI've come for you\nWe will, WE WILL SURVIVE!\n\nI've seen your kind before, feeding off the lies\nI've whored myself for less than this,\n...\n\n",

        "Is this worth fighting for\nYou're worth fighting for\nAs I face the crowd and take a bow\nThis time its up to you\nTime is up for me\nCause I've been biting my tongue for far too long\nI know that I'm too blame\nBurst into flames (you're beautiful)\nYou're worth fighting for\nI'm worth fighting for (don't say goodbye)\nYou're worth fighting for\n\nWoah ohh\nWoah ohh\nI apologize for the summertime\nWoah ohh\nWoah ohh\nI apologize for the summertime\n...\n\n"
