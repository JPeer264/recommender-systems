        "I've been staring at the edge too long\nWondering if my legs are gonna push me off\nThe feeling on the back of my neck\nWhen I trouble trust in the person I become\nI've been digging in the ground too far\nAnd it looks too deep to make it out of here alone\nBut I know the painful truth\nI could climb right out if I really, really want\nBurn what you need of me\nI'll give you a fire to light your soul\nTo be your coal when you need it\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I've been called, to testify\nA hired gun you could abandon,\nAll these fools who tried to sermonize,\nIf my misery is measured, scored with a system,\nA cold and callous case of a calculated lie,\nbut in place of pain or praise,\nJust leave me to the same mistakes,\nI've always made, and I'll always make.\nI don't want love, but I don't need hate,\nJust a simple middle of the road to keep my bearings straight.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Give me a sign that something is going to change\nbefore too long.\nOoh\nTurn on the light, this tunnel is far too dim to carry on.\nOoh\n\nAnd though it hurts to be alone, I just don't know anymore.\nIf it's worth the hurt to the feel this way.\n\nIt takes so much to see you smile, lately.\nIt's driving me up the walls, so don't ask why I'm crazy,\nThis crutch is slowin to a crawl.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Apathy\nWas a game I never played\n\nCause agony\nIs a feeling I've been steeped in slow\n\nSwapping all my smiles for a scowl\nAnd sheltering my shortcomings from every prying eye\n\nBut I'm letting the old demons out\nBringing down the walls around\nAll the denial and the doubt\n\nI won't be satisfied, till the sacrings faces fate\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I was 22 when I first died\nBut in the darkest dark I saw no light\nAnd it was blinding just how dim it got\nIt was a cold I thought could never come\n\nAnd I had hurt before but not like this\nIt was the strangest struggle I had ever hit\nAnd I was useless to the world around me\nTo barely gather up the strength to say:\n\n\"Save me\nWhen the rivers run dry\nBring me where the waters run deep\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Son, you never really have to show\nLovers what they don't really need to know.\n\nI favor sincerity,\nBut somewhere it just occurred to me\nThat you've got more to gain from a lie.\nYeah, you've got less to lose if you deny\nThe simple truth ringing in my ear, begging to be let out,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Awoken, soul slept stiff, bodies strewn askew\nIf you cut me, I swear you'd see, circles running through\nBut nowhere are the roots, there's no room for the branches born to\nrise up and claim the sky\nSo get up, we only have this time to\nmake life what we want to\nWe're stuck inside this shell\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "You say you're lonely,\nI'm lonely too.\nYou say you need me,\nI need you.\nWith all the false prophets,\nyou deserve a chance to speak.\nGot a problem and I'll solve it,\nand erase this suffering.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I've been misplaced in so many ways.\nBroken battlegrounds hiding veils of delicate deceit\nYet here I breathe, teeth still gleam from holy water,\nWhile millions of lambs migrate to the slaughter\nMy head in a bag, and my hands are bound to my feet.\nAnd voices sing,\n\"Were we laced like common thieves?\nTossed in a cell to feast with fleas.\nAll because we never admitted a word\"\nWhat will I see tonight in these eyes? And what will I know when the morning comes?\nMust we remind of exchanges existing so long ago?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
