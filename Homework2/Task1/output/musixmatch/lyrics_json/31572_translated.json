        "I'm so happy 'cause today\nI found my friends, they're in my head\nI'm so ugly but that's okay 'cause so are you\nThey broke our mirrors\n\nSunday morning is everyday\nFor all I care, I'm not scared\nLight my candles in a daze\n'Cause I've found God\n\nI'm so lonely, that's okay\nI shaved my head and I'm not sad\nAnd just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard\nBut I'm not sure\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hello, is there anybody in there?\nJust nod if you can hear me\nIs there anyone home?\n\nCome on, now\nI hear you're feeling down\nWell, I can ease your pain\nGet you on your feet again\n\nRelax, I need some information first\nJust the basic facts\nCan you show me where it hurts?\n\nThere is no pain, you are receding\nA distant ship's smoke on the horizon\n...\n\n",

        "Cheer up, honey, I hope you can\nThere is something wrong with me\nMy mind is filled with silvery stars\nHoney, kisses, clouds of fog\nShoulders shrugging off\n\nCheer up, honey, I hope you can\nThere is something wrong with me\nMy mind is filled with radio cures\nElectronic surgical words\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Long distance runaround\nLong time waiting to feel the sound\nI still remember the dream there\nI still remember the time you said goodbye\n\nDid we really tell lies?\nLetting in the sunshine\nDid we really count to one hundred?\n...\n\n", 
        "I know your eyes in the morning sun\nI feel you touch me in the pouring rain\nAnd the moment that you wander far from me\nI wanna feel you in my arms again\nAnd you come to me on a summer breeze\nKeep me warm in your love and then softly leave\nAnd it's me you need to show\n...\n\n", 
        "So this ain't the end, I saw you again today\nI had to turn my heart away\nSmiled like the sun, kisses for real\nTales, tales, it never fails\n\nYou lying so low in the weeds\nI bet you gonna ambush me\nYou'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees\nNow wouldn't you, Barracuda?\n\nBack over time we were all trying for free\n...\n\n", 
        "Someday I won't come runnin'\nWhen you call\nThe way you hurt me\nIt's a wonder I'm still here at all\n\nSomeday you'll wake up\nAnd you'll find yourself alone\nLock, stock and teardrops\n...\n\n", 
        "Once upon a time\nBefore I took up smiling\nI hated the moonlight!\nShadows of the night\nThat poets find beguiling\nSeemed flat as the noonlight\nWith no one to stay up for\nI went to sleep at ten\nLife was a bitter cup\nFor the saddest of all men\n\nOnce upon a time\nMy heart was just an organ\nMy life had no mission\nNow that I have you\nTo be as rich as Morgan\nIs my one ambition\n...\n\n",
