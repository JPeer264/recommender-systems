        "The black paper between a mirror breaks my heart\nThe moon frayed through dark velvet lightly apart\nSteal softly through sunshine, steal softly thru snow\nThe wild goose flies from winter\nBreaks my heart that I can't go, energy flies through a field\nAnd the sun softly melts a nothing wheel\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "He said hold a dollar bill up to the mirror\nAnd I'll show you something funny\nIt's only a fast buck, but\nIt's so hard to make that kind of money.\n\nNow it's hard to get serious when the joker\nIs laughing\nAnd by now the joker is wild\nIt's hard to keep laughing when a rich man's\nReflection\nLooks like a gun that's gonna smile\nWhat's going on, I ask you\nWhat's going on, can you see?\nWhat's going on, I ask you and\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
