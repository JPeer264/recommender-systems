        "I am a man with a heavy heart,\nAnd I dare not tear the pages\nFighting with automatic self destruction\nI...\n\nIt's a blind faith\nA cruel waste\nOne bitter taste\nSo I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation\n\nListen, music that we play somehow gets glued to your brain\nI'm the future when I'm in the booth done like I'm living in 3008\nThis music gave me a lane to ride in, but there ain't cars in the sky yet, so hold tight\nBecause I'm in flight like a plane with a lift of a light\nYou know why? Because I got cold bars hard like crowbars\nYou can't gamble with no cards\nWhat d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge\nMusic mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar\nTo find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark\n\nSweet sensation\nThe music that we play\nWill ease your mind\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
