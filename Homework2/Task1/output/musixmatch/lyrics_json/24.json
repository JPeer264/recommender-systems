        "In the time that remains the stars will fade\nDoesn't take what's wrong and make it right\nIt doesn't change what's come before\n\nA lot of people want to turn their heads\nAnd wave a flag and claim a moral fight\nWhen there's nothing right about it\nOne of the little lies of time\n\nJust because you're after all the men\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "At my house I have got no shackles\nYou can come and see if you want to\nIn the walls youll see the mantles\nWhere the light shines dim all around you\nAnd the streets are paved with gold and if\nSomeone asks you, you can call my name\n\nYou're just a thought that someone\nSomewhere, somehow feels you should be here\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "When I think about he and she\nIt's far away enough for me to see\n[mystery line] hard to say\nI think about you and me with a little more frequency\nbut aside from that it's about the same.\nJust like the F train, you're not waiting\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",
