        "Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel.\nMy heart's in overdrive, and you're behind the steering wheel.\n\nTouching you, touching me.\nTouching you, God, you're touching me.\n\nI believe in a thing called love.\nJust listen to the rhythm of my heart.\nThere's a chance we could make it now.\nWe'll be rocking till the Sun goes down.\nI believe in a thing called love.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I know that absence might\nMake the heart grow fonder\nOr is it \"out of sight\nout of mind\" I wonder\nAnd do you yearn for me\nWhen the nights grow cold\nTil death us do part\nTo have and to hold\nI wanna give you my love, my love, my love\n\nBut is it just me or am I all on my own again\nYou're up at John O'Groats, I'm down in Land's End\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Prawn cocktail black forest gateau, eggs and gammon with a bottle of lambrusco,\nThis is opulent luxury, I'm as happy as a pig in shit could be!\nYou keep your cordon bleu, and your seedless grapes,\nYou know where you can stick your brown eggs!\n\nBridge: I just want what every man wants,\nA nibble on your vol-au-vents... and a pint!\n\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "*snorting*\n\nIt was a dusty old night\nAnd I'm the first to admit it\nI'm sure I upset someone\nBut my memory has chosen to omit it\n\nA tiny voice was telling me\nI really should cool it\nChewing my face off\nTalking absolute rubbish\n\nThe first line hit me like a kick in the face\nThought I better have another one just in case\nNext thing I knew my heart was under attack\nBought a one way ticket to hell... And Back\n\nOne way ticket to hell and back\nBought a one way ticket to hell and back\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
