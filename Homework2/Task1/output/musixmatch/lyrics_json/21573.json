        "Don't you get me all that JIVE about things you wrote before I's\nalive,\nCause this ain't 1823 ain't even 1970\nNow I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know,\nSo every year, just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme:\nGonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good,\nGonna rock shock rock through your neighborhood.\nGonna ring it, gonna sing it till it's understood.\nMy rap's about to happen, like the knee you was slappin;\nOr the toe you been tappin' on a hunk of wood.\n'Bout a red suited dude, with a friendly attitude and a sleigh full\nof goodies for for the people on the block. Got a long white beard,\nmaybe looks kind of weird, and if you ever seen him he could give a\nquite shock. Now people let me tell ya about last year when the\ndude came flying over here, Well the hawk was out the snow's on the\nground, folks stayed into party down. The beat was thumping on the\nblcok, and I was dancing in my sockS, and the drummer played at a\nsolid pace, and a taste of the base was in my face. And the guitar\nlaid down a heavy layer of the funky junky rhythm of the\ndisco Beat. And the guy with the 88 started to participate, and I\ncould Sure appreciate it sound so sweat.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
