        "Individually, and collectively, we can raise the consciousness of the people of this planet, so that each of us will be viewed as members of the same family, who are here to claim their birthright of unconditional love and oneness. If we don't do it, who will?\n\nRelax. For is now time to cleanse your body of negative emotion of anger, fear, jealosy and hate. To accomplish this cleansing, the next breath that you take will increase the size of your body, actually expanding, from 3 to 6 inches, larger than it is right now. Expand your body out even further, maybe from 6 to 12 inches. Just let it expand in your mind and in your imagination. And now, to cleanse the body of negativity, experience that rising from the floor and moving out to this expanded consciousness of the body, is a viable transporting plane. And you can experience this finally getting to radiate, radiate, radiate out of the body. And wherever the plane moves, the negative emotions of anger, fear, jealosy and hate, are getting consumed and transfered, into the higher vibrations of love and unconditional acceptance. Higher in vibrations. Higher in vibrations. Higher, higher, radiate, radiate, radiate.\n\nAllow the plane to dive down. Place your awareness in your heart, and visualize it as a great cathedral, with bad high ceiling, high..., and long passage ways. Scroll along this halls, and see them permeated with the color pink, and I'll return to you in one moment's time.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
