        "Drugs oppress the people every day\nSellin' dope, servin' weed we had to hustle to hustle just to eat\nAin't no hope in the streets, you broke you sell dope\nAll my young niggaz outside hustlin' coke\nKnow the drama, if you ain't sellin' crack then it's ganja\nI been through it dun, hittin' niggaz two for one\nPullin' guns out and bustin' my shits too\nWhat? I ain't give a fuck\nI used to get a rush when I bust mine\nBackin' up my nickle and dimes\nGoin' thru difficult time\nWritin' my life story in rhyme\nBut when I look at all the niggas\nThey hit with mad time\nIn proportion' with the big kingpins it don't fit\nYou could get caught with barely a half a slab\nAnd the judge sentence you like you ran the ave\nI ain't plan to get rich fom sellin' that shit\nIt was survival my game plan was not to get knocked by 5 0\nBut who am I just a young nigga caught in the mix\nAnd if this weed don't sell I'm'a cop me a brick\nSellin' dope, servin' weed, we had to hustle to hustle just to eat\nSellin' dope, servin' weed, we had to hustle to hustle just to eat\n...\n\n",
