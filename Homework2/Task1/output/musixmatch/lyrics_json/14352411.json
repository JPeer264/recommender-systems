        "Swallow, lose weight, and shake the demons out\nI kept the little rules and broke the big ones\nAn ugly voice singing of the commons with such an intense hunger\nThe tallest tree with reservations to grow\nTry to grit your teeth\nWe just chew on the bit\nCould I hate you enough\nTo expose you to these walls so cold\nCrafted expressly for you\nA cage does not suit you at all\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "One drop was all it took\nThrowing rocks through ice\nHow is our footing chosen wisely?\nDo you hunch over?\nYou know my shrug\nAnd I can't pass\nThe past if it keeps coming back but\nWe were great\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I am a bird afraid of heights, I am afraid of everything\nAnd for the first time in my life, I can't be alone\nThrough seasons you learn to weather\nSmall pewter statues as reminders\nOf who we should have been\nCold and stoic we will stand\nTo face our trials and fail\nOh the pain of constantly wishing to be someone, anyone else\nYou were lost at sea, but a stones throw away and the shore told me not to remember\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        ".and I miss home, and I miss the closets, the windows, the hallways\nAnd when we are gone, who will keep up the garden?\nLike a mother calling her boy, I am, I am so unsafe\nBut she can't do it alone\nBut there's nothing stronger than her prayers.\nNothing stronger than the smell of reds.\nMy fathers reds\n\nUnder bridges waiting to look forward, waiting for rushes ends\nLiving in the moment is the homeless mantra, they know the busiest streets\nAll we have, all we have, all we have is letting sleeping dogs lay\nAll we have, all we have, all we have is letting sleeping dogs lay\nYour face lit up and for once, i enjoyed where i was\nThe truth is jade plants die, the truth is muscles atrophy\nSoftening your skin and hardening mine\n\n\"I don't know where to begin\nI've thought about this day so much and thought of so many things I've wanted to say\nBut now, now I can only look at you like the pictures I spend hours staring at\nI don't think I've ever smiled so wide as when you were holding me up\nI was given a picture the other day of a past birthday\nWe were together on our back deck\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Too seldom sanguine,\nAlways crying over closed doors\nYou should feel like you should,\nYou should feel like you should adapt well with a wistful heart\nI could never take it, but ill give you your breath back\nInfants and whales still have the holes there, never proving to be born on time\nYou keep your eyes to the light between finger and thumb and the sky just laughs as i stare at the grass,\nThe sun, the green, i want the snow years ago\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "You cant see but youre the best at hearing the friends we could be\nInsipid but still charming the hair off of our tongues, singing of dying early just to be loved\nIm ignoring grasp\nDecorating your walls with our senses,\nI'll tease you with a breeze in the heat\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
