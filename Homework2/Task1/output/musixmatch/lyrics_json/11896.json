        "Hide in your shell cos the world is out to bleed you for a ride\nWhat will you gain making your life a little longer?\nHeaven or Hell, was the journey cold that gave you eyes of steel?\nShelter behind painting your mind and playing joker\n\nToo Frightening to listen to a stranger\nToo Beautiful to put your pride in danger\nYou're waiting for someone to understand you\nBut you've got demons in your closet\nAnd you're screaming out to stop it\nSaying life's begun to cheat you\nFriends are out to beat you\nGrab on to what you scramble for\n\nDon't let the tears linger on inside now\nCos it's sure time you gained control\nIf I can help you, if I can help you\nIf I can help you, just let me know\nWell, let me show you the nearest signpost\nTo get your heart back and on the road\nIf I can help you, if I can help you\nIf I can help you, just let me know.\n\nAll through the night as you lie awake and hold yourself so tight\n...\n\n", 
        "When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful\nA miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.\nAnd all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily\nJoyfully, playfully watching me.\nBut then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible\nLogical, responsible, practical.\nAnd they showed me a world where I could be so dependable\nClinical, intellectual, cynical.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "And if my heart's had wings,\nI'd be the bird that sings,\nI'd fly where love isn't shy\nAnd everyone is willing to try.\nAnd if we had the time,\nAnd time's so hard to find,\nI can't believe what you say,\n...\n\n",

        "Had a dream, I was born to be naked in the eye of the storm\nand now it's standing right in front of me\nwhat's it going to do to me, who knows\nHad a dream, it was time to be taken to the front of the line\nwell that is not a place you wanna be\nsleeping with the enemy, you know.\n\nI don't care what the future brings, give a damn about anything\nI'd be fine if they'd just leave me alone\nBut it's time, gotta take a stance 'cause I won't get a second chance\n...\n\n",

        "I'm hooked on a problem, it won't go away\nSo many opinions, I don't know what to say\nCan somebody help me, what they trying to do\n\nLife used to be simple, life used to be fun\nbut it's all catching up on me, tell me what have I done\nCan somebody help me, what they trying to do\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "It's feeling like it's time to ring the changes\nIt's feeling like it's time to be reborn\n'Cause here we go again, proclaiming it's the end\nWe're reaching out for something to bring it back again\nWe're living on good fortune, we're cheating all our friends\nSo tell me, oh tell me, now where's it going to end\nI hope it's not too late to see the danger\nI'd really like to wake and see the dawn\n'Cause here we go again, we're trying to pretend\nWe're blaming one another for what is ours to mend\nWe're fighting for the future, we're ringin' out the past\nIt feels good, it feels good but is it going to last\n\nChorus:\nGive me love, give me love, give me joy, give me pain\nGive me light, give me starting again\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh what a way to go, we're goin' down slow\nWe're movin' to the rhythm, we're letting it flow\nWe're steppin' out of time, it's freaking your mind\nWe're livin' in the body, and we're doin' just fine\n\nChorus:\nTell me, tell me that you love me\nTell me, where's you milk and honey\nYou know we're doin' alright\n\n...\n\n", 
        "And so we sail towards the dawn, joining those who gently mourn for you\nIt's only because of you\nFriends may come and friends may go, the only friend I need to know is you\nIt's only because of you\n...\n\n", 
        "Put it in the right place, oh get into the right space\nMove it at the right pace, don't you turn into a head case\nOh you drive me crazy\n\nChorus:\nDon't say that you'll never be lonely, baby\nDon't say that you'll never take chances, lady\nFee, fi, fo fum everyone wants it baby\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell me what you like, I'll print it all\nYou need laughs, 'cause you don't need misery\nJust tell me what you need, I'll tell it all\nScrew the facts, I can give you fantasy\n\nMy magazine, I'm talking about my magazine\nMy magazine, I'm talking about my magazine\nMy magazine, I'm talking about my magazine\nMy magazine, I'm talking about my magazine\nI'm talking about\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish I was in London, walkin' in the rain\nI wish I was in London, ooh I really miss the rain\nOh, just take me home again\n\nI wish I was in England, I really miss the Queen\nI wish I was in England, ooh I really miss the Queen\n...\n\n", 
        "Alright, you make me love you, it's alright, you make me love you\nI said alright, you make me love you, it's alright, you make me love you\n\nWhen the winter wind is a-blowin', well you never know where it's goin'\nFor the land is cold and the night is closing in\nYou can feel your heart is getting older,\nyou can feel the world is getting colder\nAnd it feels so good with you standing next to me\n\nOh baby alright, I think I love you,\n...\n\n", 
        "The sun goes up, the son goes down, and still my life is just spinning around\nIt builds me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground\n\nHai hai, hai hai, hai hai\n\nThe race is on, the stakes are high, they want your body better dance or die\nThe game is up, the die is cast, this roller-coaster may well be your last\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Who believes in magic, Who's Afraid of the wolf\nWho believes it's tragic living life by the book\nI see daylight coming, in the eastern sky\nOh my love awaken, oh my love don't die\nWho's Afraid of madness, Who's Afraid of the moon\nWho's Afraid of sadness, afraid of being alone\nI can feel it coming in the eastern sky\nOh my love don't hurt me, oh my love don't die\n...\n\n", 
        "Did I tell you I need your love a little more each day\nDid I tell you I'm feeling old since you went away\nDid I tell you my love was cold like the desert night\nDid I tell you my heart was dry like the desert sky\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Please don't turn me away, please don't leave me alone\nOh I'm not asking for paradise, I just got to find me a home\n\nI said land-ho, will I be sailing forever\nOh-oh I gotta find some shelter from the cold\nLand-ho, will I be searching forever\nOh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul\n\nWell you may think I'm a fool, and think I'm running away\nBut I've had enough of the city lights, oh I've got no reason to stay\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a house on the corner, lives a man who went to war\nAnd it tries to give him shelter from the pain of what he saw\nThere's a child out the window painting faces in the snow\nAnd they smile a sad reminder of a life he used to know\n\nThere's a house on the corner, lives a man with empty eyes\nFor his heart has been broken for he was sold a pack of lies\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Why did you leave me all alone, why didn't you tell me you were going home\nEverything changes now you're gone, making me wonder how to carry on\nOver and over you gave to me, I wish I had told you what you meant to me\nWhy does it always have to end, losing a loved one is so hard...\n\nOh my Lord, is it right? By the light of the darkest night\nYou're never gonna see, you're never gonna see me crying\nWhere's the warmth of the sun? Was there something that I should have done?\n...\n\n"
