        "Simona\nYou're getting older\nYour journey's been\nEtched on your skin\n\nSimona\nWish I had known that\nWhat seemed so strong\nHas been and gone\n\nI would call you up every Saturday night\nAnd we both stay out till the morning light\nAnd we sang, \"Here we go again\"\nAnd though time goes by\nI will always be\nIn a club with you\nIn 1973\nSinging \"Here we go again\"\n\nSimona\n...\n\n", 
        "One day your story will be told.\nOne of the lucky ones\nwho's made his name.\nOne day they'll make you glorious\nbeneath the lights of your deserved fame.\n\nAnd it all comes round.\nOnce in a lifetime like it always does.\nEverybody loves you 'cause you've taken a chance.\nOut on a dance to the moon,\ntoo soon.\n...\n\n", 
        "Ooh, these feet carry me far\nOoh, my body oh so tired\nMouth is dry\nHardly speak\nHoly spirit rise in me\n\nOo, here I swear\nForever is just a minute to me\n\nAnd I'll take everything\nMmm, mmm, mmm\nIn this life\nI'll join everyone\nOoo, when I die\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Saw the world turning in my sheets\nAnd once again, I cannot sleep\nWalk out the door and up the street\nLook at the stars beneath my feet\nRemember rights that I did wrong\nSo here I go\n\nOo oo oo oo oo oo\n\nI'm not calling for a second chance\nI'm screaming at the top of my voice\nGive me reason, but don't give me choice\nCause I'll just make the same mistake again\n\nOo oo oo oo oo oo\n...\n\n", 
        "Trouble is her only friend and he's back again.\nMakes her body older than it really is.\nShe says it's high time she went away\nNo one's got much to say in this town.\nTrouble is the only way is down.\nDown, down.\nAs strong as you were, tender you go.\nI'm watching you breathing for the last time.\nA song for your heart, but when it is quiet\n...\n\n", 
        "Me and my guitar playing my way\nIt makes them frown\nThe little pieces by the highway, bring me down.\n\nMine is not a heart of stone\nI am only skin and bone now\nThose little pieces are little pieces of my own\n\nWhy don't you give me some love\nI've taken ship load of drugs\nI'm so tired of never fixing the pain\nValium said to me, I'll take you seriously\nAnd we'll come back as someone else\nWho's better than yourself\n...\n\n", 
        "Many prophets preach on bended knee\nMany clerics wasted wine\nDo the bloodied sheets on those cobbled streets\nMean I have wasted time\n\nAre there silver shores on paradise\nCan I come in from the cold\nI killed a man in a far away land\nMy enemy I'm told\n\nI really want you to really want me\nBut I really don't know if you can do that (I really want you)\nI know you want to know what's right\nBut I know it's so hard for you to do that (I really want you)\nAnd time's running out as often it does\nAnd often dictates that you can't do that (I really want you)\nBut fate can't break this feeling inside\nThat's burning up through my veins\u2026\n\nI really want you\nI really want you\n...\n\n", 
        "Are you calling for our last dance?\nI see it in your eyes ... in your eyes\nI could use the same old lines ... but I'll sing\nShine on, just shine on\nClose your eyes and they'll all be gone\nThey can scream and shout\nthat they've been sold out, but\nit paved the cloud that we're dancing on\nSo shine on, just shine on\nWith your smile just as bright as the sun\nCause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made\n...\n\n", 
        "Annie, you had your name in the bright lights\nI thought I saw your photograph having such a laugh in a magazine\nDid it all come tumbling?\n\nAnnie, you were made for the big time\nThey said you're a star to be in the NME\nBut the walls came tumbling down, down\nWill you go down on me?\n\n'Cause Annie you're a star\nThat's just not going very far\nAnd all the world will know your name\nAnd you'll be famous as you are\n'Cause I'll sing for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Is it a warning?\nIs it an evil sign?\nIs it a people who have lost their mind?\nIs it the Darkness?\nIs it a man resigned?\n\nIs it a best friend leaving you behind?\nIs it ever gonna stop?\nWill they ever let you go?\n\nYou're in a rush, they don't care enough 'cause their lives are very slow.\nTime is ticking on.\nYou don't get a second shot,\nAnd when you sell your soul for a leading role, will The Lost Souls be forgot?\n...\n\n", 
        "So while I'm turning in my sheets\nAnd once again, I cannot sleep\nWalk out the door and up the street\nLook at the stars beneath my feet\nRemember rights that I did wrong\nSo here I go\n\nHello, hello\n\nThere is no place I cannot go\nMy mind is muddy but\nMy heart is heavy, does it show\nI lose the track that loses me\nSo here I go\n\nOo oooooo ooo ooo oo oooo...\n\nAnd so I sent some men to fight,\nAnd one came back at dead of night,\nsaid \"Have you seen my enemy?\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Simona\nYou're getting older\nYour journey's been\nEtched on your skin\n\nSimona\nWish I had known that\nWhat seemed so strong\nHas been and gone\n\nI would call you up every Saturday night\nAnd we both stayed out till the morning light\nAnd we sang, \"Here we go again\"\nAnd though time goes by\nI will always be\nIn a club with you\nIn 1973\nSinging \"Here we go again\"\n\nSimona\nWish I was sober\nSo I could see clearly now\nThe rain has gone\n...\n\n", 
        "One day your story will be told.\nOne of the lucky ones who's made his name.\nOne day they'll make you glorious,\nbeneath the lights of your deserved fame.\nAnd it all comes round.\n\nOnce in a lifetime like it always does.\nEverybody loves you 'cause you've taken a chance.\nOut on a dance to the moon, too soon.\nAnd they'll say told you so.\n...\n\n", 
        "She said to me, \"Go steady on me.\nWon't you tell me what them Wisemen said?\nWhen they came down from Heaven\nSmoked nine 'til seven\nAll the shit that they could find\nBut they couldn't escape from you\nCouldn't be free of you\nAnd now they know there's no way out\nAnd they're really sorry now for what they've done\nThey were three Wise Men just trying to have some fun.\"\nLook who's alone now\nIt's not me. It's not me.\n\nThose three Wise Men\nThey've got a semi by the sea.\nGot to ask yourself the question\nWhere are you now?\nGot to ask yourself the question\n...\n\n", 
        "There are children standing here\nArms outstretched into the sky\nTears drying on their face.\nHe has been here.\nBrothers lie in shallow graves.\nFathers lost without a trace.\nA nation blind to their disgrace\nSince he's been here.\n\nAnd I see no bravery\nNo bravery in your eyes anymore\nOnly sadness\n\nAnd I see no bravery\nNo bravery in your eyes anymore\nonly sadness\nonly sadness\n\nHouses burnt beyond repair.\n...\n\n", 
        "Judging by the look on the organ-grinder,\nHe'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit.\nIt's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder.\nHe's waiting for the day when he gets me,\nBut I don't need no alibi - I'm a puppet on a string.\nI just need this stage to be seen.\nWe all need a pantomime to remind us what is real.\n...\n\n"
