        "So I sing you to sleep\nAfter the lovin'\nWith a song I just wrote yesterday\nAnd I hope you can hear\nWhat the words and the music have to say.\n\nIt's so hard to explain\nEverything that I'm feelin'\nFace to face I just seem to go dry.\n'Cause I love you so much\nThat the sound of your voice can get me high.\n...\n\n", 
        "More than a ripple, less than a splash\nThe heir to a long line of glory\nGive me the morning and I'll give you a song\nIt's so good being part of the story\n\nThis moment in time\nThis right time of day\nOh I love being with you\nAnd watching my life at play\nMy love in your eyes\nIs lighting my dreams\nAnd the feelings you choose\nHave touches of blues and greens\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey baby\nSomething's wrong, won't you tell me\nWhere's the sparkle that filled your eyes\nDon't you love me anymore\n\nNow I can see\nYou've been slipping away from me\nOnce you promised me no goodbyes\nDon't you love me anymore\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby cried the day the circus came to town\n'cause she didn't like parades just passing by her\nSo she painted on a smile and took up with some clown\nAnd she danced without a net upon the wire\nI know a lots about her'cause you see\nBaby is an awful lot like me\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't look so sad, I know it's over\nBut life goes on and this old world will keep on turning\nLet's just be glad we had some time to spend together\nThere's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning\n\nLay your head upon my pillow\nHold your warm and tender body close to mine\nHear the whisper of the raindrops\n...\n\n", 
        "Never thought I'd fall but now I hear love call\nI'm getting sentimental over you\nThings you say and do just thrill me, through and through\nOh, I'm getting sentimental over you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "This night has music the sweetest music\nit echos somethin within my heart\nI hold you near me, oh darlin hear me\nI have a mesage I must inpar\n\nYours till the stars lose there glory\nYours Till the birds fail to sing\nYours till end of lifes story\n...\n\n", 
        "And now the purple dusk of twilight time\nSteals across the meadow of my heart\nHigh up in the sky the little stars climb\nAlways reminding me that we're apart\nYou wander down the lane and far away\nLeaving me a song that will not die\nLove is now the stardust of yesterday\nThe music of the years gone by\n\nSometimes I wonder why I spend\n...\n\n", 
        "Long ago and far away\nI dreamed a dream one day\nAnd now that dream is here beside me\n\nLong the skies were overcast\nBut now the clouds have passed\n...\n\n", 
        "Each time I look at you is like the first time\nEach time you're near me, the thrill is new\nAnd there is nothing that I wouldn't do for\nThe rare delight of this sight of you, dear\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Girl, there's a secret in your eyes\nA look this man can not ignore\nGirl, I don't know what's on your mind\nSo you must know I want you more\nLike a trip to paradise\nYou're so beautiful\nBut I think you're really mine\n...\n\n", 
        "So I sing you to sleep\nAfter the lovin'\nWith a song I just wrote yesterday\nAnd I hope you can hear\nWhat the words and the music have to say.\n\nIt's so hard to explain\nEverything that I'm feelin'\nFace to face I just seem to go dry.\n'Cause I love you so much\nThat the sound of your voice can get me high.\n...\n\n", 
        "You're just too good to be true\nCan't take my eyes off of you\nYou'd be like heaven to touch\nI wanna hold you so much\nAt long last love has arrived\nAnd I thank God I'm alive\nYou're just too good to be true\nCan't take my eyes off of you\n\nPardon the way that I stare\nThere's nothing else to compare\nThe sight of you leaves me weak\nThere are no words left to speak\n...\n\n", 
        "another time, another place\nher candles flicker in the fading light\ni sit alone and watch that lonely night\ni see you everywhere and i try desperately to hide\n\nchorus:\nanother time, another place, i see that old familiar face\nand i try hard to catch your eye\nanother road, another mile, i see that old familiar smile\n...\n\n", 
        "Love me with all of your heart\nThat's all I want, love\nLove me with all of your heart\nOr not at all\nJust promise me this\nThat you'll give me all your kisses\nEvery winter, every summer\nEvery fall\n\nWhen we are far apart\nOr when you're near me\n...\n\n", 
        "And I love you so\nPeople ask me how\nHow I've lived 'til now\nI tell them I don't know\nI guess they understand\nHow lonely life has been\nBut life began again\nThe day you took my hand\n\nAnd yes I know how lonely life can be\nThe shadows follow me\nAnd the night won't set me free\n...\n\n", 
        "You are the sunshine of my life, That's why I'll always be around.\nYou are the apple of my eye.\nFor ever you'll stay in my heart, I feel like this is the beginning,'Though I've loved you for a million years.\nAnd if\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey, did you happen to see\nThe most beautiful girl in the world today?\nAnd if you did, was she crying, crying?\n\nHey, if you happen to see\nThe most beautiful girl that walked out on me?\nTell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby\nWon't you tell her that I love her?\n\nI woke up this morning\nRealized what I had done\nI stood alone in the cold gray dawn\n...\n\n", 
        "Take the ribbon from your hair\nShake it loose, let it fall\nLay it soft against my skin\nLike the shadow on the wall\nCome and lay down by my side\nTill the early morning light\nAll I'm taking is your time\nHelp me make it through the night\nI don't care what's right or wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday\nI knew the games to play\nI thought I knew the way\nLife was meant to be\nBut now there's you\nMy foolish games are through\nNow at least I have found\nJust what makes this whole world turn around\n\nLove is all I have to give\n...\n\n",

        "There goes my only possession\nThere goes my everything\n\nI hear footsteps slowly walking\nAs they gently walk across a lonely floor\nAnd a voice is softly saying\nDarling, this will be goodbye forever more\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Walk through this world with me\nGo where I go\nShare all my dreams with me\nI need you so\n\nIn life we search\nAnd some of us find\nI've looked for you\nA long, long time\n...\n\n", 
        "I have a band of men and all they do is play for me\nThey come from miles around to hear them play a melody\nBeneath the stars, my ten guitars will play a song for you\nAnd if you're with the one you love, this is what you do\n\nOh dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars\nAnd very soon you'll know just where you are\nThrough the eyes of love you'll see a thousand stars\n...\n\n", 
        "Dommage, dommage\nOur love was once exciting\nNow it's just a game we play\nTo bad but nothing last forever\nAll at once we've lost our way\n\nHello, goodbye,\nAnd suddenly it's over\n...\n\n", 
        "What now my love?\nNow that you left me\nHow can I live through another day?\nWatching my dreams turning to ashes\nAnd my hopes into bits of clay\n\nOnce I could see\nOnce I could feel\nNow I am numb\nI've become unreal\nI walk the night\n...\n\n", 
        "Come over here, come over here\nCome over here, come over here\nLet me tell you, come over here\nThat I love you, come over here\nAnd everything, come over here\nIs going just all right, come over here\nCome over here, come over here\nAnd be with me tonight, come over here\nAnd everything will be all right\nCome over here, come over here\n\nYeah\n\nCome over here, come over here\nI want to let you know\nI want you so bad, come over here\nThere must be a reason, come over here\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight\nAll over the world you can hear the sounds of lovers in love\nYou know what I mean\nJust the two of us and nobody else concerned\nThere's nobody else, and I'm feeling good holding you tight\n\nSo listen very carefully, closer now\nAnd you will see what I mean (see what I mean)\n...\n\n", 
        "Why is my heart so light\nWhy are the stars so bright\nWhy is the sky so blue\nSince the hour I met you\nFlowers are smiling bright\nSmiling for our delight\nSmiling so tenderly\nFor the world, you and me\nI know why my world is smiling\n...\n\n", 
        "I spend such a long, long time\nLooks like I get you off my mind\nOh, but I can't\nJust the thought of you\nTurns my world\nA misty blue\n\nJust the mention of your name\nTurns the flicker to a flame\nI think of things we used to do\n...\n\n"
