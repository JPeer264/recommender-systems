        "Don't you know I care\nDon't you know that I'll be there\nAs soft, as wide as air\nClimb to the stars\nShine high up there\n\nAnd fall into your stare\n...\n\n", 
        "Like jumping in the breeze, falling in the sea\nYou live up there...\nLike things you try to keep, moments as you sleep\nYou live up there...\nAnd you were angels in her hair,\nAs warm as summer air... you live up there\nLike jumping in the breeze, falling in the sea\nYou live up there...\nIt feels like fields in June and spring\n...\n\n", 
        "if I could keep\nthis moment here\nlive away\nget away\n\nand now I feel you\ncross my heart\nshining shining\nlike a jewel\n\nooh\nput me high on a wall\n...\n\n", 
        "There she goes\nFar, far far away\nThere she goes\nAnd everything she once had is gone\nEverything she had, everything she loved\n...\n\n", 
        "We're like a boat drifting\nIn a lonely sea\nAnd the stars and moon shine\nDown on me\n\nDown, down the river we go\nHolding on for dear life\n...\n\n", 
        "I look around here as I start to undress\nIt's all upside down and I must confess\nMy heads going round and I sleep less and less\nMy days are wasting and my life is a mess\n\nTears on my face in my eyes in my hair\nI call out your name but there's no one there\n...\n\n", 
        "There are feelings you know\nThat sometimes I can't show\nIt's too painful you know\nCos it does hurt me so\n\nOther times it all flows\nCan't control where it goes\nAnd it pours and it pours\nLike it will never stop\nAnd I try but it's not enough\n...\n\n", 
        "It's quiet now now\nSo won't you sleep\nJust close your eyes and fall in deep\n...\n\n", 
        "MP3 Downloads\n\n\nGive me rainbows\nto fill up my eyes\nGive me colours\nso that I won't cry\n\nGive me flowers\nas I go walking by\nIn these hours\n...\n\n", 
        "I dream of times\nWhen days are fine\nAnd seas are tall\nAnd love is all\nSolutions blind\nHere in my mind\nWhen seasons fall\nTrue love will call\n\n...\n\n"
