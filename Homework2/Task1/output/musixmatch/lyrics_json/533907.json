        "When I got out of my bed this morning\nI noticed that it didn't have a right side\nAnd my head feels like it's filled to the top\nWith pop and rocks and cyanide\n\nThere's an earthquake coming and you think you know\nWhere it started, but it started very long ago\nI need a mongoose baby, and some calgon to take me up outta here\n\nSome days just chicken bones\nYou'd better fuck off now, you'd better leave me alone\nCos I'm about to explode, just like a wonderbread bomb\nAnd I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong\nSome days just chicken bones\n...\n\n", 
        "I wanted to change the world\nBut I could not even change my underwear\nAnd when the shit got really, really out of hand\nI had it all the way up to my hairline\nWhich keeps receding like my self-confidence\nAs if I ever had any of that stuff anyway\nI hope I didn't destroy your celebration\nOr your Bar Mitzvah, birthday party or your Christmas\nYou put me in this cage and threw away the key\nIt was this 'us and them' shit that did me in\nYou tell me that my life is based upon a lie\nI casually mention that I pissed in your coffee\nI hope you know that all I want from you is sex\nTo be with someone who looks smashing in athletic wear\nAnd if your haircut isn't right you'll be dismissed\nGet your walking papers and you can leave now\n...\n\n", 
        "Boy you knock me on my ass so hard\nHow could I know that you was holding that ace card\nWhen I saw you my jaw hit the floor\nNow I don't want them other boys no more\nYou sent a laser beam of love to my soul\nYou made me shake so hard I lose control\nMy sweet director won't you give me the part\n'Cause you're the one who jump started my heart\n\n'Cause you're my supernatural defibrillator\nYou are my heavily re-animator\n...\n\n", 
        "You cannot trust me I will stab you in the back\nI'll sell your grandma on the street to buy some crack\nIf crack is not available I'll buy (?)\nYou have to take things as they come that is my motto\nI'm laying groundwork for your ultimate demise\nBut you can't see that if you look into my eyes\nI have been fucked over a thousand times or two\nAnd now I feel that I must take it out on you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Your Beauty is Unstoppable, your confidence unspeakable*\nI know you know I know you know, that I know that you know\nI'm willing to do anything, to get attention from you dear, even\nThough I don't have anything that I could bargain with\nThis is like a well-oiled machine, could I please see that smile again?\nIt's all that makes me feel like I am living in this world, I see you closing\n...\n\n",

        "For Tc and his Honeybear, the world will not moving\nFor rendezvous and longing stares and hearts that won't stop burning\nBefore that Honeybear had given up, He felt so sad and lonely\nThen one night he looked up and he saw, he saw his One and Only\nWhen Tc came onto the scene, He entered in on golden wings\nAnd with him he brought butterflies, of crimson red and emerald green\n...\n\n", 
        "One two three four...\n\nBittersweet strawberry marshmallow butterscotch\nPolarbear cashew dixieland phosphate chocolate\nMy tutti frutti special raspberry, leave it to me\nThree grace scotch lassie cherry smash lemon free\n\nI wanna go to Marz\nWhere green rivers flow\n...\n\n",
