        "I stepped into the elevator\nWith Mattie Safer\nAnd Milk-Eyed Mender\nWhen there was a blackout\nA blackout, a blackout, oh, oh\n\nWe stepped out to the pavement\nUnmanned cars were\nCrashing into unmanned cars\nIn the blackout\nThe blackout, the blackout, oh, oh\n\nWe'll never, ever go back\nTo the time when\nWhen we'd shake, shake, shake, shake it all down\nIn the blackout\nThe blackout, the blackout\n\nYou never, ever find us\nWe go out in the cold, cold fire\nYou never, ever, cold, cold liar\nNow we shine\n\nAnd you never, ever find us\n...\n\n", 
        "Behind the waterfall, that's where your lost loves have all gone.\nThey're bored and waiting for you, so put on your shoes and\n\n(chorus:)\ngo, don't stay, you know, you know that it will be alright.\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey now now, they'll find you when you're sleeping, now now\nThey'll reach in and grab what you're dreamin', now now\nCut it up and slip it back in\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know it\n\nHey now now, the smallest things are crushing me now\nThe crush, crush, crush is so comforting now\nDid the earth just slam in the sun?\nAnd I know, and I know and I know it\n\nWon't undo their past by walking and talking backwards\n\nHey now now, we're goin' down, down\nAnd we ride the bus there, pay the bus fare\nWe find a new reason, a new way of living\nAnd we breathe it in and try to dream again\n\nHey now now, we're goin' down, down\nAnd we ride the bus there, pay the bus fare\nWe find a new reason, a new way of living\nAnd we breathe it in and try to dream again\n...\n\n",
