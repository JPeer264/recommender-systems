        "I'm a travelling man, a-moving\nYou name it I've been there\nAnd night and day I strive to sell my wares\nGot nothing I can show you\nNothing you can wear\nBut hang around a while and lend an ear\n\nWhile travellin' on a freight-train\nOn the Rocky Island line\nMy young love said to me\nMy mother, she don't mind\nAnd through twelve gates of the city\nI came into my prime\nI was singing songs of wild mountain thyme\n\nSing little birdie\nFrom the greenwood side-o\n...\n\n", 
        "Put on your cloud stepping shoes, and dance\nShake off the lonely bad blues, take a chance\nSeek out and find a green jade pool\nHide behind the moon\nDon't let the judges sing your name\nRemember from where you came\n\nHe rolls and tumbles and he laughs, when he speaks\n...\n\n",

        "There comes a time babe when we've gotta go\nOur time has been\nGreat up till now but we've gotta go love\nHit the road and start another show\nOne too many mornings we've been lazing\nAnd one too many\nNights of foolin' round babe not caring\n...\n\n", 
        "Strolling down the highway\nI'm gonna get there my way\nDusk till dawn I'm walkin'\nCan hear my guitar rocking?\n\nWhile I stroll on down\nOn down the highway\n\nPeople think, I'm a crazing\nThe Lord above ain't lazing\nThe sunshine's all day long\n...\n\n",

        "To be exposed\nIn all my strife\nYou gaze upon\nMy troubled life\nBut it don't bother me\nWhat you see\nNo, oh no\nIt just don't bother me\n\nYou take my name\nAnd hang it high\nYou paint my picture\nWith colored lies\nBut it don't bother me\nWhat you do\nNo, oh no\nIt just don't bother me\n\n...\n\n",

        "I strolled in a bar downtown to lose my blues\nRest my weary feet, dust my shoes\nAsked the bartender there, \"Please,\nGive me one large glass of ruby wine.\"\nSeemed like a movie scene out of the West\nWalls made of paper card false like the rest\nStill the wine seemed real cheap\nAt one dollar a glass in nobody's bar\n...\n\n", 
        "When I was in service in Rosemary Lane\nI won the goodwill of my master and did I\nTill a sailor came there one night to lay\nAnd that was the beginning of my misery\n\nHe called for a candle to light him to bed\nAnd likewise a silk handkerchief to tie up his head\nTo tie up his head as sailors will do\nAnd he said my Pretty Polly will you come too\n\n...\n\n",
