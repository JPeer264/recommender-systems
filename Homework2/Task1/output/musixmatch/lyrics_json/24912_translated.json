Black as night, I spread my wings, and to bring you to finally, HOUSE ... ...", 
        "They say that home is where there's\nSomeone waiting, waiting for you.\nI think I've got none then if these words\nShould be really true.\nWhere is that candle in the window\nLeading me on my way.\nWhere are those open doors that open\nArms that tell me to stay.\n\nI can see your eyes.\nThe empty nights remind me\nThat I should have tried.\nAs you're the one to see...\n\nThe little big man, The little big man I am\nThe little big man, The little big man I am\n...\n\n", 
        "I&#39;ve been bleeding too long. Heavily laden with guilt. Because sleep is lighter than battles, have I lulled myself. Here you lie woven.
