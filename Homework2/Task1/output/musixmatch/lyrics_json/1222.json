        "Struck down by a vision of beauty\nSaid I was struck down by a long legged archer\nOh, the city was hot but my blood ran cold\nOh, the city went dark, keep calm and carry on\nI was a young man, only 19 years old\nSaid I was a young man so very far away from home\nShe got me, struck down\nRight through the heart, struck down\nShe shot me, struck down\nRight through the heart, struck down\nKeep calm and carry on\nReefer madness quiets the falling bomb\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",

        "Above the colour of amber stained evening\nAn audience danced\nLed by a showering hand that brings water\nAn audience danced\nLed by a showering hand that brings water\nTo both sea and land\nUnlock the door of night\nNebulous bright\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
