        "I'll be waiting on your train\nWhen you come back\nThrough the western state\nWhere I left you on the platform\nLife gets so hard\nBut I know that you'll be fine\n\nStations make me think of my own travels\nAll the people\n...\n\n", 
        "Dream, are you a dreamer?\nAre you a dreamer?\nDo you dream?\nSleep, are you a sleeper?\nAre you a sleeper?\nDo you sleep?\nWhen your brown eyes close\nDo blue skies open up?\nWhen your breathing slows\nYour mind run fast and free?\nWill you sleep\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm not questioning the way I move\nI left here for Wisconsin on a Sunday\nWith practiced inability\nTogether what comes close to me\nI always choose to leave\n\nDreaming but indifferent at best\nI laid down in the kitchen\nWith the pain across my chest\nDesire to be simplified\nThe way your stoneholds heat at night\nThere's nothing left to prove\n\nAnd this is how I learn to be alone\nStory of my life is yours to share\n...\n\n", 
        "You spent your whole night out with friends\nI spent my night inside with a book\nI hope that this one never ends\nIf we don't tell each other where to look\nPut your favourite music on the stereo\nI put my favourites on there, too\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a dream I have\nIt comes back when all the days turn into one\nI'm in a coat and hat\nAnd I'm standing on the coast of England\nWith a castle and cathedral on the sand\nI reached down to touch the water with my hand\nThen you turn and say to me\n...\n\n", 
        "This was the first year\nOf our years together\nYour mother got sick\nAnd your sister got married\n\nAnd this was the first year\nOf our songs together\nSimple cords are lovely\nSimple words are heartfelt\n\nIts the best friends that need you\nIn my case believe you\nIts the best friends lives kiss you\nIn my case miss you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear you calling me by name\nYou come around the corner smiling again\nAnd I know you're feeling better\n\nAnd so the sun might turn to rain\nThe clouds will come together over us again\nAnd they will soak us to our bone\n\nComfort our thoughts when we're feeling down\nSay what we need until we come around\nAs a matter of fact\nAs a matter of these times\nWhen we're all feeling\n...\n\n", 
        "Taking myself back to the time\nWhen we were in your room you looked straight through\nThe life that I've led, things that I've said\nMade you tired\n\nBut you could always find the best in me\nYou can allways sense the times that I've been falling apart\nThe shape of my heart shows it's marks\n\nIt's a lonely life\nWe both know that\nThings are gonna change\n\n...\n\n", 
        "All of the words keep coming\nFor me to settle down\nBut I think I heard us falling\nBefore we hit the ground\nSo much for my dark takes\nOf how we got this far\nIt's funny that we can make a thing\n...\n\n", 
        "Downtown in the fall\nAcross the sidewalks\nLeaves will all make fossils left behind\nBalancing your life\nThis way against mine\nI know you're in me somewhere\nI have the marks to prove of this\n\nCloser to the sun\nOut in the open farm\nTo the reason of this growing I will come\nAnd you will be near\n...\n\n", 
        "What will stay?\nWhen everything is going, what remains?\nWhen everything is leaving, when all has slipped away\nWhat will stay?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We'll get in my car around 10: 30 that night\nFor the New York city skyline, destination of our sights\nIt's the biggest healing session that I've had for some years\nThe laughter and the driving and the letting go of\n\nShe seems to have a way\nOf making me feel\nYou always have a way\nOf keeping me real\n\nHold me, my world is closing\n...\n\n", 
        "I look out my window\nI'm catching the view\nWhere Queen Streets meets Chestnut\nOne block west of you\nThe strange conversations will set your heart free\nOur strange conversations lift burdens from me\nMy friend\n...\n\n", 
        "I remember thinking\nThat someday you'd leave\nPraying in your bedroom\nBefore I fell asleep\n\nI still feel the moment\nYou came alive\nLike a poem about springtime\nNothing to hide\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I need to take a look before you go away\nBefore I spend my time with what I need to say\nBut you're so free around everyone but me\n\nIt's the city lights, and it's a New York sky\nYou don't want to hear, 'cause I'm not ever right\nYou should be with anyone but me\n...\n\n", 
        "How you found me out\nI still never understand\nThoughts you can't take with you when you go\nYou were waving flags that bear the colors of your love\nI didn't know\n\nOrange for the vineyards\nBlue is for the rivers\n...\n\n", 
        "My room has a big white bed\nPictures on the mirror\nBooks that last a year\nEverything but sleep\nDon't you know\n\nNothing won't fit under there\n(Nothing won't fit under there)\nThe maker's ghost\nThe heavenly host\n...\n\n", 
        "Can you hear the ringing of the bell tower?\nCounting off the days we can't replace\nI would like to think it's not that way\nAll the songs that find you in the city\nPull you from your bedroom to the streets\nPushing all your sadness underneath\n\nThere's a song I've been singing\n...\n\n", 
        "Dream, are you a dreamer?\nAre you a dreamer?\nDo you dream?\nSleep, are you a sleeper?\nAre you a sleeper?\nDo you sleep?\nWhen your brown eyes close\nDo blue skies open up?\nWhen your breathing slows\nYour mind run fast and free?\nWill you sleep\n...\n\n", 
        "Skipping like a stone\nAcross the bluest pools of what I know\nDon't know where to go\nEach one leaves a mark\nCircles through the dark and sinks into\nThe place I need you most\n\nAs far as the east from the west they say\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a dream I have\nIt comes back when all the days turn into one\nI'm in a coat and hat\nAnd I'm standing on the coast of England\nWith a castle and cathedral on the sand\nI reached down to touch the water with my hand\nThen you turn and say to me\n...\n\n", 
        "Lately I've been waking to\nthe blueset dawns that i once slept through.\nThe morning hangs like open chords\nthat I fell in with my own thoughts and words.\n\nI used to worry all the time,\nBut I slowed down to live my life,\n...\n\n", 
        "Mary, you are the bird inside the hand\nOf St. Francis, in the garden where he stands\nHandwriting, a birth mark and a quilt\nMother to my mother and to me and to me\n\nMary, you are the mason jars in spring\n...\n\n", 
        "This is what it's like\nFinding your feet again\nHe part of you that couldn't\nFinally thinks you can\n\nYou're taking off some time to do this\nA small apartment bedroom rearranged\nTo know that you are loved\n...\n\n"
