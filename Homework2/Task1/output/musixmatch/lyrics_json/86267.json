        "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of someone gently rapping, tapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door-\nOnly this, and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in a bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nPresently to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-\nMerely this, and nothing more.\"\n\nOut into the darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"-\nMerely this, and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
