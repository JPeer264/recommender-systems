        "There's blood in the sink and he's plunging his wrists in\nA hangover halo is washing away\nMechanic-school dropout stares into the mirror\nStands up in his derelict daydreams\n\nAlways too tall, always walked around wearing\nA smile that was never quite sure of itself\nPlanning a future of failures inflicted\nIn phone calls from strip clubs and bail bonds\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Her body is a difficult sister, and she loves her\nAnd hides her somewhere in herself, safe from harm\nShe's barely coasting into a paycheck, stuck on empty\nHer blue eyes frozen green in the low-lit ATM\n\nI need a way to measure the distance\nI need a way to say why\nOut of breath or out of key\nHer voice resonated in me\n\nWish on everything\nPray that she remains\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
