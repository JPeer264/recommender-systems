        "Old John Brown left Kansas before the blood had dried\nAnd as he rode his head did shine like the sun in mid-July.\nIn a tiny farm house by Brunswick piano\nHe warmed his boots by the fireplace and read aloud from Samuel.\nDavid rose to beat the Philistines with five smooth stones and a sling.\nOne October morning his army did approach\nThe armory that sat between the Potomac and Shenandoah.\nThe engine house flung open with report of several guns\nWhen it was done he looked upon the bodies of his dying sons.\n...\n\n",

        "If knee-deep in cat nip\nAt the old icebox\nI recommend you whistle\nAnd give the box three knocks\nShould you be so lucky\nTo hear whisperin'\nIt is an invitation\nFor you to leap in\n\nMay you go marching in three measure time\nDressed up as asses, drunk to the nines\nSwing from the rafters\nShouting those songs\nGone unsung for far too long\n\nIf boxing your shadow\nAt the wall full of moss\nAnd antlers approach you\n...\n\n",

        "You look so good while you're riding\nOn your pterodactyl\nStorming castles with abandon\nAnd rainbows by fistfuls\nNow lets go dancing madly backwards\nWhile on a sea of air\nEveryone I hear is saying\nCaptain Peon will be there\nWhen we go carelessly careening quickly\nScreaming all the way\nGravity is such a drag\nAnd we will not obey\nCarelessly careening quickly\nScreaming all the way\nGravity is such a drag\n...\n\n",
