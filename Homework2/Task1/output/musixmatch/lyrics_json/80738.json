        "I said, blue drag,\nIt sure is draggin' me down:\nI'm almost scraping the ground\nWhen I hear that blue drag.\nSlow drag,\nIt's got that new lazy swing;\nI crave that new crazy swing;\nI must have my blue drag!\nOh that rhythm, blue rhythm, has brought me\nA peculiar phase;\nOh that rhythm, blue rhythm, has brought me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
