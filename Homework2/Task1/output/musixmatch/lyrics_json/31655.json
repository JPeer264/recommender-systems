        "Wake up in the morning with a head like \u2018what ya done?'\nThis used to be the life but I don't need another one.\nYou like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns.\nSo how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?\n\nSo I'll play along when I hear that special song\nI'm gonna be the one who gets it right.\nYou'd better move when you're swayin' round the room\nLooks like the magic's only ours tonight\n\nBut I don't feel like dancin'\nWhen the old Joanna plays\nMy heart could take a chance\nBut my two feet can't find a way\nYou'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway\nBut I don't feel like dancin'\nNo sir, no dancin' today.\n\nDon't feel like dancin', dancin'\nEven if i find nothin' better to do\nDon't feel like dancin', dancin'\nWhy'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?\nDon't feel like dancin', dancin'\nI'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn, with you\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
