        "A blacksmith courted me\nNine months and better\nHe fairly won my heart\nWrote me a letter\nWith his hammer in his hand\nHe looked quite clever\nAnd if I was with my love\nI'd live forever.\n\nBut where is my love gone\nWith his cheeks like roses\nAnd his good black billycock on\nDecked round with primroses\nI'm afraid the scorching sun\nWill shine and burn his beauty\nAnd if I was with my love\nI'd do my duty.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My love said to me\nMy mother won't mind\nAnd me father won't slight you\nFor your lack of kind\nThen she stepped away from me\nAnd this she did say,\n\"It will not be long, love\nTill our wedding day\"\n\nShe stepped away from me\nAnd she moved through the fair\nAnd fondly I watched her\n...\n\n", 
        "Where dips the rocky highland\nOf Sleuth Wood in the lake\nThere lies a leafy island\nWhere flapping herons wake\nThe drowsy water-rats\nThere we've hid our faery vats\nFull of berries\nAnd of reddest stolen cherries.\n\nChorus:\nCome away, O human child\nTo the waters and the wild\nWith a faery hand in hand\nFor the world's more full of weeping\nThan you can understand.\n\nWhere the wave of moonlight glosses\nThe dim grey sands with light\nBy far off furthest Rosses\nWe foot it all the night\n...\n\n", 
        "Dear thoughts are in my mind\nAnd my soul soars enchanted\nAs I hear the sweet lark sing\nIn the clear air of the day.\nFor a tender beaming smile\nTo my hope has been granted\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish I was in Carrighfergus,\nOnly for nights in Ballygrant\nI would swim over the deepest ocean,\nOnly for nights in Ballygrant.\n\nBut the sea is wide, and I can't get over.\nAnd neither have I wings to fly,\n...\n\n", 
        "Here's a health to you bonny Kellswater\nWhere you get all the pleasures of life\nWhere you get all the fishing and fowling\nAnd a bonny wee lass for your wife.\n\n\nOh it's down where yon waters run muddy\nI'm afraid they will never run clear\nAnd it's when I begin for to study\nMy mind is on him that's not here.\n\n\nAnd it's this one and that one may court him\nBut if any one gets him but me\nIt's early and late I will curse them\nThe parting lovely Willie from me.\n\n\nOh a father he calls on his daughter\nTwo choices I'll give unto thee\nWould you rather see Willie's ship a sailing\nSee him hung like a dog on yonder tree.\n\n\nOh father, dear father, I love him\nI can no longer bide it from thee\nThrough an acre of fire I would travel\n...\n\n", 
        "As I walked out one morning\nAll in the month of May\nDown by a flowery garden\nI carelessly did stray\n\nI overheard a young maid\nIn sorrow did complain,\nAll for her absent lover\nWho plows the raging main.\n\nI boldly stepped up to her\nAnd put her in surprise.\nI know she did not know me\nI being in disguise.\n\nI says, \"Me charming creature,\nMy joy, my hearts delight,\nHow far have you to travel\nThis dark and dreary night?\"\n\n\"I'm in search of a faithless young man.\nJohnny is his name.\n...\n\n", 
        "Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free\nAnd stand where the peaks meet the sky and the rocks reach the sea\nWhere the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun\nAnd cares of tomorrow must wait till this day is done.\n\nCome by the hills to the land where life is a song\n...\n\n", 
        "O for a voice like thunder, and a tongue\nTo drown the throat of war! - When the senses\nAre shaken, and the soul is driven to madness,\nWho can stand? When the souls of the oppressed\nFight in the troubled air that rages, who can stand?\n...\n\n", 
        "All hail to the days that merit more praise\nThan all the rest of the year,\nAnd welcome the nights that double delights\nAs well for the poor as the peer!\nGood fortune attend each merry man's friend\nThat doth but the best that he may,\nForgetting old wrongs with carols and songs\nTo drive the cold winter away.\n\nTis ill for a mind to anger inclined\nTo think of small injuries now,\nIf wrath be to seek, do not lend her your cheek\n...\n\n",
