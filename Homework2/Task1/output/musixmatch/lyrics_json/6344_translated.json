        "Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation\nDarkness stirs and wakes imagination\nSilently the senses abandon their defenses\n\nSlowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor\nGrasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender\nTurn your face away from the garish light of day\nTurn your face away from cold, unfeeling light\nAnd listen to the music of the night\n\nClose you eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams\n...\n\n", 
        "Somewhere in time I know,\nDarling you'll come back to me.\nRoses will bloom again,\nBut Spring feels like eternity.\nIn your kiss it wasn't goodbye.\nYou are still the reason why\n.\nI can hear you whispering in the silence of my room,\nMy heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon.\nI can barely stand this aching, burning endlessly.\n\"Love me now forever,\"\nWere the last words you said to me.\n...\n\n", 
        "And so many things I'd forgotten,\nIn a world that we shared,\nWith so many things for the asking.\nNever asked for the madness there.\nStrange how I find myself\nSo often on a distant shore.\n\n...\n\n",

        "There's no time for us,\nthere's no place for us,\nwhat is this thing that builds our dreams,\nyet slips away from us.\nWho wants to live forever,\nwho wants to live forever, ...?\n\nthere's no chance for us,\nit's all decided for us,\n...\n\n",

        "What is life revealing but base reality\nTake it how you want to nothing comes for free\nWe go all around believing in perfect harmony\nWho tells us that's the right way? Just open up and see\n\nLike living on an island, I'm lost no land in sight\nLike living on an island, I'm drifting without end\nSomehow believe in this dream of life like living on an island\n...\n\n",
