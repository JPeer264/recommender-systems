        "Me oh my, my oh me\nI fought the night and the night fought me\nKnocked on the door, used its key\n\nHe and I, I and he\n...\n\n", 
        "Did you wake in the morning with the sun in your eyes?\nBut you don't have a song to sing for your love\nI rock the beat, but I don't have time\nAnd I don't have a song to sing for my love\nSad sad feet and sad sad eyes\nI'll go blind to save you, not gone looking to take it back\n...\n\n", 
        "I\u2019ve got a love - I\u2019ve got a love\nOpen my hand and make a jump\nI\u2019m on a train it\u2019s overrun\nI fought like it\u2019s not the only one.\nWhy could you go, where could you stay,\nI\u2019ll die on my feet an\u2019 I\u2019ll pass away\n...\n\n", 
        "Get out and run like a street fight is on\nAnd I'm willing to see what you have\nIt's not the last time I've looked at him\nAnd it's not the end\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Make frightening plans\nAnd see them with your hands\nIt's the measure of the man\nThe weight of these words\nFalls like feathers in the sand\nAnd so till me from the land\nTill me from the land\nTill me from the land\n\nSpread fire through the grounds\nObliterate the towns\n...\n\n", 
        "Beauty rare I don't want to share\nShe says that hands fill holes\nEyes so bright, they just steal the night\nAnd she rows where she rows\n\nMy sister young, my sister strong\nShe sparks in ebbs and flows\nI ride behind, keeping hounds in line\nBut I cast my shadows low\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't ever want to dig your hideaway\nI don't ever want to find them in the ground\nIf I could die, we could get so far away\nI loved the sun and you loved to sun\nAnd ah I dig all night with tired eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "I want to burn until the end\nSee all my friends tie up loose ends\nI'll find asylum in the sun\nFeel the light when she comes\n\nFind another ghost\nGo settle down but love me most\nSplit the time in two\nHalf for me and half for you\n...\n\n", 
        "When the tide comes in\nAnd splits the land between\nMy love counts on me\nBut skip the land and row\nWhere it's bound to blow\n...\n\n",
