        "Over the top of a lager in wineless wine bar\nI can see the sunset over Blackbird hill\nIt's only the cocaine comaradarie\nKeeping the thugs from moving in for the kill\nFriends desert me through choice and pressure\nI know the faces but I'm not safe\nA kiss torn curl blows through your hair\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Aun recuerdo la primera vez\n Cada beso que te robe \n Abrazados al atardecer\n Con los sueos siempre a flor de piel\n \n Aun recuerdo aquella cancion \n Que era un himno para los dos\n Cada vez que algo anda mal\n Me basta con volverla a escuchar\n \n Jamas, jamas, jamas\n Jamas yo te dije adios\n \n Aun te llevo dondequiera que voy\n Como un tatuaje dentro del corazon\n No, no, no, no, no\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Each day I walk along this lonely street\nTrying to find, find a future\nNew pair of shoes are on my feet\nCos' fashion is my only culture\n\nNothing ever change, oh no...\nNothing ever change\n\nPeople say to me just be yourself\nIt makes no sense to follow fashion\nHow could I be anybody else\nI don't try, I've got no reason\n\nNothing ever change, oh no...\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "You can say whatever you like I'm not listening anymore\nIt makes no odds whatever you say I'm not listening anyway\nYou can scream until you are blue in the face\nI'm not listening anymore\nSo don't bother - save your breath - I'm not listening anymore\n\nJUST SHUT UP!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
