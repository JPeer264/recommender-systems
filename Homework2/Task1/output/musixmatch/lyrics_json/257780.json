        "We crept from the room\nThe moonlight spilled down the hall\nAnd I tiptoed with you\nThen we climbed out the window\nAnd there in the yard\nOur nightclothes blowing in the breeze\nAnd you looked up at the sky\nAnd said the moon would be ours\n\nAnd all this time I hear those words like bombs in the distance\nAnd oh my mind, I can still smell the rain in the air\n\nBut time's gone by\nAnd I'm not the kid I was on that evening\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I tied your shoes while you sat and watched the rain\nHands folded across your lap, and the dull work of paints across your face\nMom down the hall Bible pressed to her chest\nWhen she swore the Devil hides in everything, and her room was the only safe haven left\nShe watched you scrub through our new paints\n\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething's in the way\nYou had held my hand while the wind whistled our dreams ending time\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Back when I used to wander, I was always out looking for signs\nBut they were never there, so I'd pull 'em from the air\nWe all believed in something, but like you I can't say why\nIt's just a whisper in our ear, or a bottle for our fears\n\nHold me to light, let me shine\nCome hold me to the floor and say it's alright\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
