        "Doing the mess around\nPush me down into the ground\nTaste the hands that drink my body\n\nFight me in the dark\nWrestle your bones over mine\nInto our moonless march come the wizard\n\nCome, the wizard comes\nThe wizard comes\nThe wizard comes\nThe wizard comes\n...\n\n", 
        "Got woken in the night,\nby a mystic golden light.\nMy head soaked in river water.\nI had been dressed in a coat of armor. They called a horse out of the woodland.\n\"Take her there, through the desert shores.\"\nThey sang to me, \"This is yours to wear. You're the chosen one, there's no turning back... now.\"\n\nThe smell of redwood giants.\n...\n\n", 
        "The trophy that I made for us\nIn fur and gold\nGot into the wrong pair of hands\nIn truth was sold\nThey bought it for oh so much less\nThan it was worth\nAnd every man that touched it\nFound a heaven on earth\nHeaven is a feeling I get in your arms\nHeaven is a feeling I get in your arms\nHeaven is a feeling I get in your arms\nHeaven is a feeling I get in your arms\n\nThe queens and the court jesters\nClapped, adored\nTheir hearts swelled to\nOverdrive and mercy soared\nMercy this and mercy that\nLet justice prevail\n...\n\n", 
        "Community saw the best in me\nExchanging the common heart for the salt in the sea\nChildren of the sun on a highway of hope\nThe beauty of coming together\nIn sorrow\n\nTahiti we don't got no name\nTahiti we don't got no home\nTahiti we don't got no money\n...\n\n", 
        "We walked arm in arm\nBut I didn't feel his touch\nThe desire I'd first tried to hide,\nThat tingling inside was gone\nAnd when he asked me:\n'do you still love me?'\nI had to look away\nI didn't want to tell him\nThat my heart grows colder with each day\n\nWhen you've loved so long\nThat the thrill is gone\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't like the things you don't say\nLeaving it for such a long long time\nWhy do you show me those sad sad eyes\nEach time you decide to pass on by\n\nAnd when you smile those sad eyes\nLook sadder and sadder still\n\nAutumns hue in those sad eyes\nMakes me love and love them more\nI'll have a bath, i'll make the dinner and then I'll go away for a long long time\nBut still you haven't passed my door\n...\n\n", 
        "Doing the mess around\nPush me down into the ground\nTaste the hands that drink my body\n\nFight me in the dark\nWrestle your bones over mine\nInto our moonless march come the wizard\n\nCome, the wizard comes\nThe wizard comes\nThe wizard comes\nThe wizard comes\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a girl that wants to start\nBeen thinking about having a couple of kids\nComb a brush around their heads in the morning\nTo be needed, simply and be needing\nHer name is Karen\nBeen on the road for so long\nShe wants to live in a place that has a number in a name\nFind lovers and anchor before the courage is gone\n\nShe really loves him, Prescilla\nShe really loves him, Prescilla\n...\n\n",
