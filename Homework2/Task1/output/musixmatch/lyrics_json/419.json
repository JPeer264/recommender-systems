        "Earspot in a cornfield\nWe got a girl in an army coat\nPull up the Gran Turino\nAnd play some music for the holy ghost\nGo go go\nYeah baby smoke them bones\nPraise me the Bullgod\nShe got fleas stuck all over her skin\nTake a dive in the nose bleed\nAnd let the snake dance begin\nShe licked a sheet of water\n...\n\n", 
        "Place the stones in a circle of twelve\nGive my night to brother of the bell\nRise from the light\nThat swallows me whole\nDig yourself\nDig yourself\nSun comes up\nOne great day\nFoil of the cobra\nDries the sweat off my face\nRighteous meek\nRighteous brown\nYeah\nDig yourself, baby\nDig yourself, baby\n...\n\n", 
        "Bought another copy of fragile\nSeeds were bustin' up the spine\nI think I cracked my skull doin' airplanes\nNot too many but it's just fine\nPussy scratching sniff in a playboy\nChrist i'm a good looking man\nFifteen miles to cop on a stingrays\n...\n\n", 
        "The shape of a zodiac lung\nIs beckoning like a bad christ\nIt hovers above your head\nIt's pulling the world over my life\nIf you don't hear a word I'm saying\nYou can't cover it with your hair\nYou can't hide it in your army coat\nYou've got the miltown demon stare\nYou forgot all the letters that you wrote\n...\n\n", 
        "You're a long way from home\nAnd you can't sleep at night\nGrab your telephone\nNow something ain't right\nAnd that's evil\nEvil\nGoing home baby\nI said I'm warning you brothers\nYou'd better watch your happy home\nLong way from home\nAnd you can't sleep at night\n...\n\n", 
        "Oil of love, swimming in a zodiac\nLion's den, pig juice, crown on the dingo king\nI got a line to the stars, I got wire to myself\nI'm gonna use all you pigs for something else, yeah yeah\n\nSufi's in the penthouse nailed to a wall of flesh\n...\n\n", 
        "Saw your face last night on the tube\nStrong fine snake in a sucker's vacuum\n15 clicks and it's time to say bye\n15 trips and a love that won't die\nMe and myself killed a world today\nMe and myself got a world to save\nBroadcast dead revolution don't pay\nStrapped up freaks on the Lazarus plane\nI can tell just by the climate, and I can tell just by the style\nI was born and raised on Venus and I may be here a while\nCause every supersonic jerkoff who plugs into the game\nIs just like every subatomic genius who just invented pain\nI will deny you\nI will deny you baby\nI will deny you\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm gonna plant your man\nOut in the fields\nHe ain't tapped like me, baby\nAnd I can use the wheel\nI'm gonna cop me some peace\n\nI wanna take it slow\nI wanna tighten your evenings, baby\nOut on the crystal road, alright\nTime is gone and life is short\n\nI gotta go\nI'd love to get to loop ya somehow\nYeah\n...\n\n", 
        "My hands up to the maker\nMy head's down in the bomb\nI swim in bloated vision\nAnd I kiss you on the phone\n\nMy heart beats so atomic\nAnd I spill the sweat of drones\nA mouth screams to a hundred\nAnd my lips split all alone\n\nSometimes I think this pig will just explode\nSometimes I hope this torture just goes on\nWell, I'll stuff myself in a pit of darkness\nAnd I'll slam 'til I can't see home\n\nWould you like to hope for Eden\nThat I keep a steady hand?\nDo you want to milk the syrup\nOf a thousand year old man?\n...\n\n", 
        "Well my buddy Jo gave me a laughing pill\nWell it tasted like shit and it gave me the chills\nI saw his girlfriend's face in a bucket of water\nHe said a buck for the snatch and a nipple's a quarter\n\nWell I'm telling you freaks, I've eyes in the back of my head\nAnd I can hear you laughing at me when I'm lying in bed\nYou better be righteous when you're cutting me up\nCause you'll be doing it (wrong) and I'll be fucking you up\n...\n\n"
