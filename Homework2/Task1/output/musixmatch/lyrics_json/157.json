        "Strikes across the frontier and strikes for higher wage\nPlanet lurches to the right as ideologies engage\nSuddenly it's repression, moratorium on rights\nWhat did they think the politics of panic would invite?\nPerson in the street shrugs -- \"Security comes first\"\nBut the trouble with normal is it always gets worse\nBut the trouble with normal is it always gets worse\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Sun climbs toward high noon,\nGlints metallic off the bowl of the spoon\nSliding through the air toward parted lips\nWatch the expression when the straight taste hits\nFace crumples, tongue's quickly withdrawn\nI hate to tell you but the candy man's gone\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Tokyo jetlag evening walking\nOut of my throat appears this chuckle\nA true 20th Century sound\nA little crazed and having no tonal centre\n\nThe echoes of this laugh fade for a long time\nSnaking among those jumbled pedestrians\nFollowing that struggling Cedric taxicab\nSliding over the seeming infinity of white light and neon\n\nWith no warning, mind's eye winks like a lifespan\nAnd opens again on memory flash of prairie Indian\nDancers -- they're on a stage, all jigging motion\nAnd flare of bright feathers, surrounded by white faces\nFloating on a sea of mind\nHoop dancer struts in front -- drum and voices blend with endless rain\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Body lines fluid in static heat\nThoughts buzzing like flies around meat\nLand here -- land there --\nQuick circles in the air\nI'm riding smooth but just a little slow\nWaiting for the moon to show\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Away from the river\nAway from the smoke of the burning\nFearful survivors\nSubject of government directives\nOne sad guitar note\nEchoes of the wall of the jungle\nSeen from the air they're just targets with nowhere to run to\n\nChildren of rape\nRaised on malnutrition\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Moon across the valley\nSquatting on the roof\nOf the dirty gray bank\nLike a cop with no proof\n\nWe were lying in bliss\nLove was cooling into sleep\nThere was a dream on the horizon\nAnd a punch-up in the street\n\nWe were lying on the mountain\nby the satellite dish\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Don't need the everlasting trade expansion\nDon't need the cold white heroin breath\nDon't need Pizzarro or the Inquisition\nNo berserk worship of a hero's death\nDon't need reactionary politicians\nDon't need the gunfight at the O.K.\nDon't need no Reverend Paisley hate-masturbation\nDon't need no Jihad or no IRA\n\nWe need to put our hearts together\nSet up a rhythm in combination\nAnd if we put our hearts together\nWe get a rhythm that will shake creation\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I need a helmet to protect my head\nI need earphones to hear what gets said\nI need a miracle to keep this little thread from snapping\n\nI know a lot about alienated man\nBut we've all heard as much about that as we can stand\nIt's just what happens when you let the time span catch you napping\n\nTwo forward and one back\nBlind fingers groping for the right track\nWhat's to do when a stab and a pat on the back look like the same thing?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
