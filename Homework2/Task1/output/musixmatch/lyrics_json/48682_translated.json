        "Spaceless mistaken thoughts about -unerreichbar- Breathless you running behind -hoffnungslos- How black water rushes past the time she pulls up with drops you I burn, rip me, go on the reality it is the downfall for me Forgive the time in &quot; morning &quot;we do not find us ...", 
        "When you fell into my arms\nAppearing so frail, if you ever were\nAnd you told me a thousand things\nI've never dreamt about\nWhen your eyes fell grey\nCould it be I made them shine for awhile?\nNow you're gone, as if you ever meant to stay\n\nBe my rain\nBe my rain\n...\n\n", 
        "When you fell into my arms\nAppearing so frail, if you ever were\nAnd you told me a thousand things\nI've never dreamt about\nWhen your eyes fell grey\nCould it be I made them shine for awhile?\nNow you're gone, as if you ever meant to stay\n\nBe my rain\nBe my rain\n...\n\n", 
        "When you fell into my arms\nAppearing so frail, if you ever were\nAnd you told me a thousand things\nI've never dreamt about\nWhen your eyes fell grey\nCould it be I made them shine for awhile?\nNow you're gone, as if you ever meant to stay\n\nBe my rain\n...\n\n", 
        "In your room\nWhere time stands still\nOr moves at your will\nWill you let the morning come soon\nOr will you leave me lying here\nIn your favourite darkness\nYour favourite half-light\nYour favourite consciousness\nYour favourite slave\n\nIn your room\nWhere souls disappear\nOnly you exist here\n...\n\n", 
        "The sunlight reflects in your eyes\nYour tears ceased to flow\nYou're back in balance\nThe fallacies leave you alone\nAnd your nightmares are replaced by reality\n\nYou're floating away\nRight up and over the barriers and borders\nBoundless and free is your mind\nIt took ages for you to feel this way again\n...\n\n", 
        "In the beginning it was just a glimpse\nFar too fleeting to care about\nBut I can still remember the initial traces of your change\n\nThen you became so adaptable\nNo deviation from your ways\nLike the world in your eyes is just spinning inside of you\nThere's only you and you and you . . . \n\n...\n\n", 
        "We're walking along the infinite path\nWhile we are shaking from the fear inside\nIt's rising gently and thin\nBut we sense nothing, we don't feel a thing\n\nIf I know what you would say next\nWhat I could tell you - you know too\nSo we stopped talking,\n...\n\n", 
        "At a second glance \nYou thought you recognised despair\nFor a fraction of a second \nYou were searching for a reason\nYou pretended cheerfully, \nBut instead you tried to hide away\nWhen everybody's laughter \nSeems to rip you all apart\n\nAnd your life carries on the same\nAnd your life will be the same\n...\n\n", 
        "In your room\nWhere time stands still\nOr moves at your will\nWill you let the morning come soon\nOr will you leave me lying here\nIn your favourite darkness\nYour favourite half-light\nYour favourite consciousness\nYour favourite slave\n\nIn your room\nWhere souls disappear\nOnly you exist here\n...\n\n", 
        "Again you stand here so still, every day And nothing happens around you All is silent around you The rain does not bother you Your gaze remains silent and empty and you are looking for the memory but what brings you the memory ...", 
        "When you fell into my arms\nAppearing so frail, if you ever were\nAnd you told me a thousand things\nI've never dreamt about\nWhen your eyes fell grey\nCould it be I made them shine for awhile?\nNow you're gone, as if you ever meant to stay\n\nBe my rain\n...\n\n", 
        "Dimensions are shifting\nBurning holes in my direction\nThe habit of lightness disintegrates\nReconciliation fails, \nI'm passing by within a whisper\nEverything appears a false delight\nBut in vain, I turn away\n...\n\n", 
        "An unbelievable distance\nThat you can't overcome\nYou thought you could bear to the end\nEverything that was precious\nYou had lost at once\nYou thought you could keep it all your days\n\nThe day has come to stop pretending\nSo tempting that you can't resist\n...\n\n"
