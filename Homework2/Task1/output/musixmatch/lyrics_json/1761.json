        "Three friends are made, three lives are laughs and tears\nThrough years of school and play they share\nAs time stands still the days change into years\n...\n\n", 
        "The bell rings\nAnd all things\nAre calling\nThe days past\nThe play's cast\nRemember\nSeptember\nWhen we were\nTogether\nTogether\nTogether\n\nSchooldays the happy days when we were going nowhere\nSchooldays the happy time when we were feeling no care\nSchooldays when three said that we'd better be friends forever\nHow long is ever isn't it strange\nSchooldays together why do they change\nHow long is ever isn't it strange\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Working all day, I'm digging up the roads, just working all day\nDig for my pay and spend it where I like. I've nothing to say\nDrown in my sweat but money buys escape. I've got no regrets\nWorking all day\nWorking all day\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Free from the start -\nLeft to depart -\nFinding the pleasure and the pain in his art\nLost in the hush -\nNo need to rush -\nTime waits for him, him who creates with the brush\nColour the brush\n\nHigh in the air -\nHis dreams are there -\nSearching for answers he will look everywhere\nThinks he has won -\nA place in the sun\n...\n\n", 
        "Look around my rooms and see the prizes I have showing\nWorking hard to build my life and plan the way I'm going\nHouse and car and pretty wife \u2013\nThey've all been won by knowing\nAll been won by knowing\nAll been won by knowing.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Once three friends\nSweet in sadness\n...\n\n", 
        "The birth of a realisation;\nThe rise of a high expectation;\nEmerging successful, defiant;\nTogether the parts make a Giant.\nSee the world in the palm of his hand,\nStriding steps that will cover the land.\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm sorry to have been so much of a bore\nBut in my own funny way I find I learn much more\nI realise what you think from your eyes,\nBut in your own funny ways I find I learn much more\n\nMy ways are strange\nThey'll never change\nThey stay, strange ways\n\nI'm sorry to have been so close from the start,\n...\n\n", 
        "Lying still;\nAm I dreaming\nFeel the chill\nBreath of fear\nEvil fingers\nHover, linger\n...\n\n", 
        "Isn't it quiet and cold walking all alone, alone?\nHappened I missed the bus and found I had to walk, alone\n\nWhat was that?\nOnly me\nHear the echo of my feet\nFootsteps\nAre they mine?\nHear the echo of the street\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Now she sits by the riverside\nWatching the waters glide by,\nWith a sigh\nAnd the things she put faith in\nAre ripples just waving her by\nWith a sigh\n\nShe sees lovers pass by with much more than a kiss\nAh this - little girl who had everything\nfind she's nothing at all\n\nNow the wind seems so cold\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't sing a tune to yourself\nYou might believe this one\nTry not to sew it yourself\nThe threading won't stretch none\nDon't give me none of that line\nWhy not?\nGot to sing something\nLove's song there's nothing to find\nWhy not?\nDead before playing\n\nDon't sing a tune to yourself\nYou might believe this one\nTry not to sew it yourself\nThe threading won't stretch none\nWho says the things that go in\nThe song is only saying\n...\n\n",
