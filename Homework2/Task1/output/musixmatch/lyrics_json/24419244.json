        "Im wondering how, we fell through,\nGot a little too much in my head, like I miss you,\nEach passing light, reminds me,\nNothing could lift me from the dark, till I found you,\nAnd everyday goes, running with the same flow,\nBut theres always something washed away,\nI dont know how, we fell through,\nGot a little too much in my head, like I miss you,\nA million lights, behind you,\nIm a little too much in the dark, here without you,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Too much of anything can make you sick\nEven the good can be a curse\nMakes it hard to know which road to go down\nKnowing too much can get you hurt\n\nIs it better?
