        "The imitation picks you up like a habit\nRiding in the glow of the TV static\nTaking out the trash to the man\nGive the people something they understand\n\nMistake a nervous flash for a fine-line smile\nJunk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a stock\nRich man in a poor man's clothes\nThe permanent installment of the daily dose\n\nAnd you tell me, \"fool, you tell it like it is\"\nYour wall's gone wider than your head trip is\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",
