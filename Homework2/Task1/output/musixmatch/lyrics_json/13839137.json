        "All the world can't hold a candle to you\nCause' all the world is in the dark\nI'll tell you why I'm so sure\nOoh! I took a shine to you\n\nAnd all them ladies can't change your mind\nAnd all them girls can't turn your head\nAnd all them lions in the jungle at night\nI don't worry 'bout my baby\nDon't worry 'bout you baby\n\nCause I know why I don't worry\nI sing me no sad songs\nHappy! Never sad for long\nDon't you call me anything doll, but your baby\nI know...\n\nAll them girls might wanna rip us apart\nIf they wanna fight, they done fucked with the wrong heart\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "You aint alone, so why you lonely?\nthere you go on the dark end of the street\nare you scared to tell somebody how you feel about\nsomebody? are you scared what somebody's gon think?\nor...\nare you scared to wear your heart out on your sleeve?\nare you scared me?\n\nCause i'm scared the bomb gonna take me away...\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
