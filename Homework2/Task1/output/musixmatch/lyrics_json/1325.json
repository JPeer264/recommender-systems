        "When it's kill or be killed baby\nI sometimes wish we ate our young\nIf fear was clear, then just maybe\nAll your sweet dreams will make you strong\n\nBabe, you need some help\nBabe, not by yourself no\nHey, a plea for mercy\nHey, your winter's here to stay\n\nDig a hole, dig it deep\nBury yourself alive\nSay a prayer, say one for me\nThen kiss your ass goodbye\n\nAll out of time, your luck's on empty\nYour pain if flows like falling rain\nIt's never ending\nYour faith comes from the damage done\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't think I'll hang around here\nMaybe I could\nFlying so high, no landing gear\nDon't do nobody good\nYou slide around this sleazy town\nNose pressed to the sky high\nYou slide around this funky town\nThinking you'll never die\n\nLies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies\nAnd when you're falling down\nWatch out as you hit the ground\nLies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies\nAnd when you're falling down\nWatch out as you hit the ground\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm not content to be with you in the day time\nGirl, I want to be with you all of the time\nThe only time I feel alright is by your side\nGirl I want to be with you all of the time\n\nAll day and all of the night\nAll day and all of the night\nAll day and all of the night\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Dancing on a tightrope\nWalking with the moonshine\nSneaking up the wrong road\nMaking up an alibi\n\nClawing, scraping, living ain't easy\nLooking for a friend\nDancing madly backwards and forwards\nSearching for the bend\n\nKeep on rollin', let it flow\nGot a feelin' I want you to know\nRock the river, shake the lake\nWe're gonna do whatever it takes\n\nMaking no apologies\nOut of mediocrity\nI'm feelin' like a dynamo\nWith no particular place to go\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Flying far from the scene of the crime now\nNothing more that I want to be part of\nGonna break the chains that been holding me down\nGonna spread my wings and I'll fly now\nGonna set my sights on the velvet moon\n\nI can hear my train is a comin'\nI can feel my blood is a boilin'\nI see my fate on the wings of a cloud\nWings of a cloud Wings of a cloud\nWings of a cloud\n\nYou can keep your vision of a perfect world\nIt's just a matter of time, it's gonna crash and burn\nShooting stars are gonna be my only friends\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear a black cat moaning\nIn the middle of the night\nLike a smoke stack lightning\nThat's burning bright\nI went down to the crossroads\nWhere I met a man\nHe said: I'll show you the way\nIf you take my hand\nI ain't superstitious, but maybe I should\nI'd cast a spell on you if I could, if I could\n\nOh no, here it comes\nLooks like I'm in trouble again\nBad luck ain't heaven sent\nLooks like I'm in trouble, trouble again\n\nStanding in the shadows\nIn the middle of the night\nKnee deep in quicksand\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me tell you a story, not gonna take too long\nJust sit on down and listen under the sun\nPapa, he was a drinking man, Mama wasn't very strong\nHe liked whisky and women, drank all night long, all night long\n\nThat night he had a nasty feeling, if he stayed in town too long\nThe life that he'd been leading takes him down to the bone\nThe moon was full around midnight, the sheriff took my\nPapa down, down, down\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby walks, baby talks\nBaby got them voodoo thoughts\nBaby pants, baby chants\nBaby does the back street dance\n\nShe swoons in the moonlight\nShe screams in the sunlight\n\nYou got voodoo - Voodoo Brew\nYou got voodoo - Voodoo Brew\n\nMojo moves, cajun grooves\n...\n\n", 
        "In the darkness your heart is breaking with no one there\nThere's a sadness, you shed a tear but no one cares\nKeep on running from the shattered dreams you can't repair\nLook for comfort, your empty life's so hard to bear\n\nIn the middle of the night when you think you can't go on\nCan't you take it\nIn a broken state of mind, will you make it\nWhen the waves of loneliness rush to tear your life apart\nWill they drown you\nIs it freedom that you want\n\nTake me away, Monday morning breakdown\nYou can't escape, early warning cry\n...\n\n", 
        "Mama, mama, mama, mama yeah all right\n\nCan't take a look in the mirror, it's gonna bust the beast\nBut I am alive\nI only flirt with danger until I feel the heat\nThat's how I survive\n\nThe slave that I can't master\nEternal life thereafter\nSick of it all\n\nLive! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts\nGive! Give! Give and take all you deserve\nDo what you do till your black and blue\nLive! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts\n\nAnd when my body hungers I feed my passion first\n...\n\n",
