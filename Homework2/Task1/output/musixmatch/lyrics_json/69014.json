        "Wind me up, put me down\nStart me off and watch me go\nI'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know\nA little off center, and I'm out of tune\nJust kickin' this can along the avenue\nBut I'm all right\n\n'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done\nYou can't stop now, it's already begun\nYou feel it runnin' through your bones\nAnd you jerk it out\nAnd you jerk it out\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Well you really had me stuck like a rabbit in your headlights\nYeah, you had me in a corner, and I didn't even put up a fight\nBut now everyone knows it's over between you and me\nIt's right plain in sight of anyone, can't you see?\n\nYou've been tryin' so hard to find me\nBut I was lost right from the start\nThe longer we stay together, baby\nthe further we drift apart\n\nIt was mystic romance, you know I never really stood a chance\nSuch a sucker for you, you had me dancing like as in a trance\nBut now eveyone knows it's over between you and me\nIt's right plain in sight of anyone, can't you see?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "All my life I've been fall- fall- falling apart,\nBeen tumbling down quick first right from the start\nI never learned just get up and go on\nUntil I'm just knocked right off of my feet\n\nBut it's not the fall that hurts\nIt's when you hit the ground\n...\n\n",
