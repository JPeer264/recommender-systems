        "Found a hole that fill inside myself\nThis emptiness by my own hand\nSo constricted, self inflicted\nIt's more than I can stand\n\n(Chorus:)\nGot to break free from this disease\nAnd I know without a doubt I just want more\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't remember the last time I could say\nI was where I wanted to be\nstill you see through this mask\nhiding all my flaws\nyou see something down deep in me...\n\nBring me back so that I can feel you again\ntake me to that place I was before\nall I want is to hold my head up high\nso take this life and set aflame again\n\nStill I linger around\n...\n\n", 
        "You're time is done, I'm moving in\nI've come to fight or lose, so go ahead and try me\nYou know I've just begun, just begun\n\nYou've never seen a fight like this before\n(Like this before)\nI take you down and leave you there wanting more\n(More)\nYou've crossed the line that I cannot ignore\n(Cannot ignore)\nYou've never seen a fight like this before\n(Yeah)\n...\n\n", 
        "I take a walk in the bitter cold, \nI try to see your face, \nThe way it used to be, \nThe sky was never grey, \nThere was a time when I let you in, \nYou turned my night to day, \nBut I turned you away \n\nBurn back the sun, \nBring back the fire once \nBlazing inside this hollow cage \nBurn back the sun, \nYou were the only one \nTo love me with passion's quiet rage \n\n...\n\n", 
        "Ten thousand miles from home,\nAnd still I know that you're right here with me,\nThey say,\nI must deny the truth, if I want to live\nBut I won't turn from you\n\nChorus:\nUntil I live my final day,\nI'll speak your name\nI won't be afraid,\nUntil I draw my final breath,\nI'll breathe for you,\n...\n\n", 
        "Pull the trigger now, end me,\nMark me for the kill,\nLike I marked your hands your feet,\nI spilled all your blood, flowing deeper,\nTo suffocate the sin, till I'm drowning you again\n\n(Chorus:)\nI am so alive, since you took my life\n...\n\n", 
        "Your signal across the sky,\nIs trying to bridge the distance,\nAnd all of the reasons why,\nI'm so far away,\nI know you can move the time,\nAnd the space that falls between us,\nI know you can cross the lines,\nAll I can say is,\nBreak them down\n\n(Chorus:)\nYou are what's turning my world around,\nMoving me close in the moment with a single motion,\nEven when all of my stars are falling,\n...\n\n", 
        "Where could I go to escape from you? \nBreak from you? \nIf I move beyond eternity, \nYou would be... \n\n(Chorus:)\nI fall everytime, into another place, \nWhere I always find, your single saving grace, \nWhether I have climbed, or fell into the blue, \nI'm never lost from you, \nNever lost from you \n...\n\n", 
        "I never knew just what to do,\nWhen I came to life and all those promises,\nAlways earned every word that came along the way,\nNow I know that what I sow, will always be the way things really just grow,\nForever now, please show me how,\nTo fight these feelings, they're still reeling\n\n(Chorus:)\nNo longer will I have to remind the past,\nThose I've come to glimpse of it, (Yeah)\nNo longer will I carry this weighted past,\n...\n\n", 
        "If yesterday was here I,\nI could turn and face all my fears\nWhen tomorrow calls my name I,\nI won't be afraid\n\n(Chorus:)\n...\n\n",

        "Every time I try to fight You\nI always end right beside You\nStuck in my ways, it's not too late\nAll the waves crashed around me\nLike all the little notes You left me\nI'm not too late, I'm not too late\n\nI'm not alone but feeling cold\nWith all the pressure burning inside me\n\nI'm wasting away and it's all I can take\nI'm ready to change, I'm not gonna break\nI'm wasting away and it's never too late\n...\n\n", 
        "Every time you come around again\nFeeding lies, feeling trapped again\nYou will not make it, we'll complicate it\nThe time is now\nYou're going down\n\n[CHORUS:]\nWhen I'm in over my head\nGotta find another way out\nI should have been the one with the strength\nTo turn from you when I was in doubt\nI'm not the willing one\nSo back down, or give up now\nIt's time to pack it up and move on\nThis battle's already been won\n...\n\n",

        "Like shooting star\nHow brief we are\nI wish this moment could last forever\nHere with you\nI am made new\nI want to live like every breath matters\n\nYou are not so far away\nJust hear me when I say\n\nChorus:\nI want to love what U love\nI want to see what U see\nI want a heart that burns like a fire in me\nI want your light in my life\nI want my heart renewed\nHere I am forever with You\n...\n\n"
