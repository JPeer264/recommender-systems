        "It's four AM, I'm waking up to your perfume\nDon't get up, I'll get through on my own\nI don't know if I'm home\nOr if I lost the way into your room\nI'm spiraling into my doom\nI'm feeling half alive but I know one day\nYou and I will be free,\n\nTo live and die by our own rules,\nFree.\nDespite the fact that men are fools.\n\nI'm almost alive, and I need you to try\nAnd save me.\nIt's okay that we're dying,\nBut I need to survive tonight, tonight.\n\nWell excuse me while I get killed softly,\nHeart slows down and I can hardly tell you I'm okay\n...\n\n", 
        "In the moonlight, your face it glows\nLike a thousand diamonds, I suppose\nAnd your hair flows like the ocean breeze\nNot a million fights could make me hate you\nYou're invincible, yeah its true\nIt's in your eyes where I find peace\nIs it broken? Can we work it out?\nLet's light up the town, scream out loud\nIs it broken? Can we work it out?\nI can see in your eyes, you're ready to break\n...\n\n", 
        "Share with me the blankets that you're wrapped in\nBecause it's cold outside, it's cold outside\n(it's cold outside)\nShare with me the secrets that you kept in\nBecause it's cold inside, it's cold inside\n(it's cold inside)\n\nAnd your slow shaking finger tips show\nthat you're scared like me so\nLet's pretend we're alone\nAnd I know you may be scared\nAnd I know we're unprepared\nBut I don't care\n\nTell me, tell me\nWhat makes you think that you are invincible?\nI can see it in your eyes that you're so sure\nPlease don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable\nImpossible\n...\n\n", 
        "Waiting for your call, I'm sick\nCall, I'm angry\nCall, I'm desperate for your voice\nListening to the song we used to sing in the car\nDo you remember, Butterfly, Early Summer\nIt's playing on repeat\nJust like when we would meet, like when we would meet\n\nI was born to tell you I love you\nAnd I am torn to do what I have to\nTo make you mine\nStay with me tonight\n\nStripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh\nI am feeling so ambitious\nYou and me, flesh to flesh\n...\n\n", 
        "Didn't you want to hear the sound of all the places we could go\nDo you fear the expressions on the faces we don't know\nIt's a cold hard road when you wake up\nAnd I don't think that I\nHave the strength\nTo let you go\n\nMaybe it's just me, couldn't you believe\nthat everything I said and did, wasn't just deceiving\nAnd the tear in your eye, and your calm hard face\nmakes me wish that I was never brought into this place\n\nThere goes my ring... it might as well have been shattered\nAnd I'm here to sing about the things that mattered\n...\n\n", 
        "Speak with your tongue tied\nI know that you're tired\nBut I just want to know\nWhere you want to go\nI may be sad, But I'm not weak\nThis situation is bleak\nAnd your puffy eyes never lie\nYour tears come from inside\n\nUntil Sunday I'll be waiting for an answer\nI guess that yesterday's not good enough for you\nYou know that I hate this song\nYou know that I hate this song\nBecause it was written for you\n\nDrown your fears with me\n...\n\n", 
        "With every appearance by you, blinding my eyes\nI can hardly remember the last time I felt like I do.\nYou're an angel disguised.\n\nAnd you're lying real still\nbut your heart beat is fast just like mine.\nAnd the movie's long over\nthat's three that have passed, one more's fine.\n\nWill you stay awake for me?\nI don't wanna miss anything\nI don't wanna miss anything\nI will share the air I breathe\nI'll give you my heart on a string\n...\n\n", 
        "The night smells like December\nAnd we're deep undercover\nStaking out what could be better than all the money in the world\n\nAnd I am watching you and I am waiting\nFor the perfect time to start participating\nAnd you signal me to stay\nBut I open my mouth anyway\n\nNow it's over, we're goners\nIt's out of our control\nAnd if there's one thing that I know\nIt's that it's best to let it roll\nSo lets just let it roll\nLet's just let it roll\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish my life was this song 'cause songs they never die\nI could write for years and years, never have to cry\nI'd show you how I feel without saying a word\nI could wrap up both our hearts, I know it sounds absurd\n\nAnd I saw the tears on your face, I shot you down\nAnd I slammed the door but couldn't make a sound\nSo please stay sweet my dear, don't hate me now\nAnd I can't tell how this last song ends\n\nThe way that I feel tonight, so down, so down\n...\n\n",
