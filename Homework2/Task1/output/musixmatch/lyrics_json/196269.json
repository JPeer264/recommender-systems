        "Feel like a superhero, what type of dreams are these\nI'm as high as a eagle, I'm taller than the trees\nAnd I can't turn back, I tell my heart relax\nLate at night, in the dark, I close my eyes\nAnd suddenly everything is gone\nI'll be lifted, lifted, lifted\nReach up for the light\nI'll be lifted, lifted, lifted\nDevil can't catch me tonight\nI'm not afraid, and I'm not alone\nEven if I'm dancing on my own\nI'll be lifted, lifted, lifted\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Some people stand in the darkness\nAfraid to step into the lights\nSome people need to help somebody\nWhen the edge of surrender's in sight\nDon't you worry!\nIt's gonna be alright\n'Cause I'm always ready\nI won't let you out of my sight\nI'll be ready (I'll be ready)\nNever you fear (no don't you fear)\nI'll be ready\nForever and always\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
