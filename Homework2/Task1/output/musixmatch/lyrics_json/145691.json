        "Come fly down, like a singing bird\nSings your name, I am still the same\nBlack and white, no you're not to blame\nHolly sweet, put me down to shame\n\nLights in the car in the park\nI'm falling on my face I know who we are\nAnd I ain't looking down for the rest of the night\nA bullet in my head ended late last night\n\nJack and coke, please take off your coats\nCome and dance, shuffle with a glance\nCome and smile, please stay here a while\nWhen you're gone, bring in for the dawn\n\n...\n\n",

        "In the light of the sun\nIs there anyone?\nOh, it has begun\n\nOh, dear, you look so lost\nYour eyes are red when tears are shed\nThe world you must have crossed, you said\n\nYou don't know me, you don't even care\nOh yeah, you said\nYou don't know me, and you don't wear my chains\nOh yeah\n\nEssential yet appealed\nCarry all your thoughts\nAcross an open field\n\nWhen flowers gaze at you\nThey're not the only ones\n...\n\n", 
        "Wait dear, a white horse is walking down my street here\nYour words are creeping at my feet\nI fear, sunrise will come to soon and you'll disappear\nInto the haze of this city and go south\n\nLook out, they're coming after us with big guns\nThey're only gonna tell you all the bad things I've done\nEven if they words they say aren't true they've won\nNow I'm left here dying in the sun\n\n...\n\n",

        "Now I'm sitting on a plane, lonely flight back to LA\nDon't come back with me\nSo I'll drink myself to sleep, cut my skin until I bleed\nHold my breath all the night\n\nCause it's 5 o'clock, the hour stops the sunlight\nAnd the buildings shade the masquerade and kill time\n\nHear the sound, she was naked on the ground\nTill I whispered in her ear\nCome away, watch the dawn break through the day\n...\n\n", 
        "I swear I never watched you sleeping\nWell honey, I'm an honest man\nI guess it always gets me drinking\nShe makes me sad\n\nSweet, sweet and cold\nClean up the mess and sleep the day away\nWhen you call\nI might be here, I might be gone\n\nBut here at the sound of the bells you cry\nYou've lost your mind\nBut dear, don't be sad\nIt's just a dream you dreamt you had\nBut I ain't seen you look so good\nSo honey\n\nI guess it always gets me drinking\nWell Holly, she makes me sad\n...\n\n", 
        "When she's sleeping on the sofa\nWhen she's laying in her Sunday best\nWhen she's turning over Friday\nI could swear I'm sleeping less and less\nAnd the ocean's getting warmer\nAnd California's on her mind\nLos Angeles is tired, but we always seem to feel alright\n\nAnd I won't\nNo I won't...\nNo I won't...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "California's burning, burning, burning to the ground\nAnd my head is turning, turning, turning round and round\nAlie's stomach's churning, churning, like a storm today\nAnd your mother's crying, crying, closing up the safe\n\n...\n\n",
