        "Jack was born towards the end of the 19th century\nHe married his sweetheart at the age of 23\nShortly before the birth of their first child he answered the call of duty\n\nHe carried English bayonets, in an English way\nHe smoked German cigarettes on Christmas Day\nHe never made it past 25, he died at Passchendaele\nFighting for the cause in the war to end all wars\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't go down to the park\nI don't go down after dark\nI don't go down on my own\nI can't bear to be alone\n\nTell the heathen I believe in everything they say\nWake the sleeping, time is keeping demons far away\nI've been thinking about getting out of here\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I cannot see the day for night\nI feel the clouds closing in\nI cannot put a single foot right\nI don't know where to begin\n\nThey bring me down, they push me around\nThey kick my face into the ground\nAnd I know this because I was there\n\nAnd then there's Leni with the love in her hands\nWhen she's around I find it hard to understand\nShe winds me up and down again, again and again\nShe might as well leave me for dead\n\nThere are times when I will need you\n...\n\n",
