        "Oh, mighty lord of the evil realm\nOpen the gates to your dominion\nSave me from this holy light\nThat makes me suffer like a pig\nSatan, lead me to your throne\nAnd make me one with Hell\nI kneel before you, dark lord\nAnd swear the unholy oath\n\nUnholy master Satan, make my wish come true\nOpen wide your kingdom where all the evil rule\nLord of Hell, possess my soul\nWith thousand mad and insane demons\n...\n\n",

        "Unholy master Satan, take my blackened soul\nShow me the secret gate where the lord of darkness rules\nTake away my life, take it far away\nTake it to the shadows, I must die\n\nInto realms of darkness where eternal shadows fall\nMy soul shall be free, departed from the dying world\nEmbraced by the dark lord, my soul shall be immortal\nForever and ever I follow my master Satan's call\n\nIn the sign of the horns, come and take my life\n...\n\n",
