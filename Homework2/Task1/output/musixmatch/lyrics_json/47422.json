        "When your hand brushed against mine, I thought I'd collapse\nI'm no rolling stone, I gather too much moss\nMaybe it's 'cos I'm gettin' a little bit older\nBut oh, how your neck flows to your shoulder\nIt draws me, it draws me to your flame\n\nI wanna be near you and blink in your light\nAnd toast marshmallows on a cold dark night\n(By your flame)\nI wanna be near you and blink in your light\nAnd toast marshmallows on a cold dark night\n\nYour flesh it melts in my mouth like Holy Communion\nBut you don't really care for Jesus now do you?\nA photograph of this love hangs on my wall\nI would dare to speak its name, if I knew what it was called\nI would dare to speak its name, if I knew what it was called\n\nRattle the one whose shadow you're standin' in\nUnder the branches after it's been rainin'\n(By your flame)\nRattle the one whose shadow you're standin' in\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
