        "Zeigeist - Bunny from The Jade Motel\n\nDon't you look at me and think you've got a chance\nA tank-toped-muscled-boy can never show romance\nCause I will move along to dance floor bodies\nand you can stay and watch as you do with movies as I dance\n\nA tank-toped seeked my eyes as well the other night\nI let him touch my razorblade and sent him off to die\nNo regrets at all moved to dance floor masses\nBetter proof yourself or you\u2019ll burn to ashes as I dance\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Winding is this road of yours\n(Walk on your own)\nConfident of early scores\n(They will be gone)\nWaiting is my favorite bore\n(Maybe you ll see)\nThwarted love will hurt me more\n(Reconcile me)\n\nA million of worse things\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
