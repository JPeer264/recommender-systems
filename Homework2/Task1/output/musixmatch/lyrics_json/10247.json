        "Against All Odds\"\n(feat.\nMariah Carey)How can I just let you walk away,\nJust let you leave without a trace,\nWhen I'm standing taking every breath,\nWith you, ooohhh,\nYou're the only one who really knew me,\nAt all.How can you just walk away from me,\nWhen all I can do is watch you leave,\nCause we shared the laughter and the pain,\nAnd even shared the tears,\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
