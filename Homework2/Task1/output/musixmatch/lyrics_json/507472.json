        "There is no freedom\nThat can be found\nWhen you got the feeling\nYou're down for the count\nThis Ol' World will be you up if you let it\nAnd this time it's really knocked you down\nDon't throw in the towel now, you'll regret it\nCatch your breath and go another round\n\n[Chorus:]\nBut you gotta get on up\nBefore you can do the dance\n...\n\n", 
        "I thought we had a good thing join'\nI bought that good times and good vibes were flowin'\nBut lately you're leavin' a different impression\nIt's like all you believe in is playing these guessing games\n\n[Chorus:]\nAnd the hardest part is knowing the meaning\nIn the lack of the things you say\nI'm on to all of your tricks\nAw, you're slicker than Jesse James\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "I sat at home alone\nWaited by the phone\nNo matter how hard I tried\nI couldn't get on with my life\nI tried medication, meditation\nI've still gone insane\nIf I can't live without her\nI'll have to kill the pain\n\nHey, bartender, make it, shake it, take it\nWon't you pass it down\n'Til I can't remember\nWhat I came to forget about\nAw, pick any mixer, fire up the blender\nAnd freeze my brain\nIf I can't live without her\n...\n\n", 
        "Seems everywhere I go these days\nI run into friends that say\nIts written on my face\nIm all about you\nSo if you ever walk through the door\nAnd wonder what Im smiling for\nIts cause I could not ask for more\nIm all about you\nOh, Im all about the way you kiss me baby\nAll about those little things\nYou do that got me going crazy\n...\n\n", 
        "When you work, work, work all the time\nIt's like living in a prison without committing a crime\nWhy not laugh, laugh, laugh when you can\nSo go bury your toes and troubles in the sand\n\n[Chorus:]\nIt won't matter anymore\nNo, It won't matter anymore\nPick a coast\nRent a boat\n...\n\n", 
        "The things you say\nThey hit with the right sometimes\nThey hit me with the left sometimes\nBut I'm still standing\nFor us, they make me want to dream sometimes\nthey make me want to scream sometimes\nI'd never give you up\n\nNo you are not alone\nI am in this too, this us, this is me and you\nSo, go turn and walk out that door\n...\n\n", 
        "After years of confusion\nIt's clear there's no more delusion\nIt's here my conclusion\nI like girls with cans or bottles in their hands\nAin't scared to pop a top with me\n\n[Chorus:]\nReal women drink beer\nAnd get country crazy\nThat denim on their rear\nFits just right to me\n...\n\n", 
        "Well my momma used to tell me\nA good woman's hard to find\nGet a God fearin' down-home girl that'll stay right by your side\nBut momma's boy's grown up\nAnd there's been a change in plans\nCause I love women my momma can't stand\n\nI love little tank tops\nTight fittin' jeans\nBlue collar babies who ain't scared of old Jim Beam\nRed lipstick on a Daytona tan\n\nNow I'm just a good old boy\nI ain't doin' nothin' wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "There we were just small town fools\nLearning more from each other than we did in school\nLiving on love, a couple bucks and an old Ford truck\n\nWe graduated, had the summer to kill\nSpent most of our nights parked in a wheat field\nTime flew by, with September came goodbye\nShe promised me she'd come back someday\nShe's still the one that got away\n\nStill got a way of making me feel\nLike I'm eighteen and the world's standing still\nTailgates down, no one's around for days\n\n...\n\n"
