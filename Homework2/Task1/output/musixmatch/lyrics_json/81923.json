        "Bow for me, inferior\nI demand you in the name of the horns\nFor I am the one\nTo bring the demise of the bearer of thorns\nYou who's father\nso pityful upon the cross died\nBehold it inverted\nAnd burning under the nightsky\n\nInferior lord of heaven\nYour might shall fade\nJesus has wept\nOn goathorns impaled\n...\n\n", 
        "To reach the point in this desolation\nWhen it all unveils\nThe revelation of a mysterious light\nWas yet another dismal mirage\nAnd I beheld another gate open\nTo a wound where dead flesh crawls\nA loathsome spawn of what is feigned\nBy feeble minds, a thin veil that shines\n\nStrong and Luminious\nyet suffering from life's malady\nImmense, yet chained\nburning for Him\nCelestial\nbut trapped inside life's malediction\n...\n\n", 
        "Show me the face of uttermost madness\nReveal the mystery of time reversed\nFor in chaos lies mights forgotten\nFrom which we all have emerged\n\nCrawling from wombs - a vast reflection\nA rupturing from deformed flesh\nYet a false revelation, a pointless effort\nFor the truth of al life is Death.\n\nFor your bodies form a giant shape\n...\n\n", 
        "Born into a fatal illness\nAscension unto a graceless sphere\nYet the chain forged in sulphurfires\nEmerges with them through labias lair\nThe stench, the curse, the sacrilige divine\nThe enduring of rupturing cold\nBrought to life, crushed to dust\nBy an impenetratable presence of dark\n\nIncarnation of plauges and of longdead pests\nFornication of all brought to life\nShadow majestic, spell infernal\nAt the core of mankind as a lifefeasting tumor\n\n...\n\n",

        "A pallid shape is floating\nA lurid shroud of fading life\nWhat ones was a place so glimmering and bright\nHas ignited itself and burnt out of light\nI canonize thee, lord of the odius\nFor enlightening the path to perpetual might\nFor guiding me on this voyage\nWith nothing but scornful mirages in sight\n\nDevour me, oh immense shadow\nThis locus is cursed, shroud me forever\nDamnation be my lodestar\nFor humanity carves my veins\n...\n\n", 
        "Spawn of the darkest evil divine\nA creation of the holy womb\nStep aside for lord Sathanas\nHis fist so deep within\nA servant am I and in flesh am I captured\nHoly flesh and holy sin\nOh, the strength it does not take\nTo deny life's lying pleasure\n\nTheir wars stills my hunger\nThe tears in their eyes still my thirst\n...\n\n", 
        "Beyond gods pestilent grace\nObscured by light his spawner dwells\nHidden but soon to be found\nBeyond shrouds of fading life\nAll fires leave reeking ashes\nNot only glow that shines\nAnd the dawns you've blessed shall be cursed\nA thousand times\n\nClean the mirrors from the dust of God\nAnd nothing shall be there\nFor you are to weak to turn the key\nChained to life by fear\n...\n\n", 
        "Feel the coming of a storm\nOf wrath burning red as blood\nThundering forth\nWith poison in veins and death in the eyes\nUnder banners as mirrors reflecting\nThe darkness above and below\nAnd the eye...\nThe eye that is him\n\nBonecrush, bloodlust\nBehold the remains of jehova in the dust\n...\n\n", 
        "Created by them\nYet reborn through Him\nBlessed from life and lie\nFor the cunts that are licked\nBy your gentle tounges\nAre raped and cursed to die\nSo far beyond\nYour rottening grace\nYet trapped in smelling chains\nFor the bodies you caress\nI have cursed\nAnd put cancer in their veins\n...\n\n",
