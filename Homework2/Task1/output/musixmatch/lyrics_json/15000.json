        "Yeah yeah\nYeah yeah\nYeah yeah\n\nWalk this life beneath the stars\nContemplate just who we are\nAgainst the backdrop of knowing God\n\nSeasons pass, they come and go\nBut one thing keeps its worth in gold\nA timeless bond, sharing dreams we hold\n\nIt's larger than life, it's larger than we\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I'm looking for a friend to hold the door\nIt's cold outside when I don't know where to find\nA sheltered place secluded from the race\nOf this old life\n\nAnd as I walked out in the downpour with no raincoat\nI was soaked down to the bone from head to toe\nWithout my raincoat, anywhere I may go\nI still get wet somehow\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Death is no conflict, for those who do belong,\nThe very last life breath, starts a brand new song\nPromised to find, what I've been looking for,\nI guess then we will meet right at Heaven's door'\n\nChorus\nAs I wander the streets of gold\nTalk to all the friends I've known\nWe'll go adore the Master King,\nThen only then I'll be breathing in.\n\nFor me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,\nWhen I leave this earth, I'm not coming back again\nSo I wear this life like a dirty coat,\nGive up my tattered threads when I cross the moat.\n\nLife has no conflict, for those who do belong,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "We've both been mistreated, no wish to repeat this no\nBut you're sorry, you wonder\nIf ever I'll show you grace again, yeah\n\nMy vision is tunneled, my motives, oh so rageful\nThe mirror I'm readin'\nSays, \"Forgive and then forgive again\"\n\nThough there's a wrong\nA grudge will tear us down\nWe wait too long, the air turns stale\n\nSo will we reconcile?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "When everything is wrong, the day has passed and nothing's done\nAnd the whole world seems against me\nWhen I'm rolling in my bed, there's a storm in my head\nI'm afraid of sinking in despair\n\nTeach me, Lord to have faith\nIn what You're bringing me will\nChange my life and\nBring You glory\n\nThere on the storm I am learning to let go\nOf the will that I so long to control\nThere, may I be in Your arms eternally\nI thank you, Lord, You are the calmer of the storm\n\nYou rebuke the wind and the waves, once again I find I'm amazed\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Shallow capacity is bearing all I see and I know\nIt's disease, it's loss\nIt's death knocking at my door\nI click these thoughts to something else, something more\n\nAnd I'm so blue, so blue\n\nDetached harmonies, all the airways scream dissonance\nAnd we know of broken life, broken homes\nBroken hearts and broken bones\nRecycling the paper of a crying world's suicide note and\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
