        "Fire dance of self deprecation dopamine receptivity\nThe orphans of piety we are birthed into sorrow and shame\nA truth to believe a thirst for reprieve\nOur throats scorched with the sins of our fathers we burn with the sins of our fathers\n...\n\n", 
        "Whispered words these walls breathe the inanity of accusation \nAnd a moment of gifting passes through what once was identity \nIn a movement beyond truth and falsity I can sense them in the mountains \nOn either side of every side \n...\n\n", 
        "Enticed by the myriad multiplicity.\nEntombed by our own disguise.\nWe will dive into vast unknowns.\nAn ember remains to unearth a hope.\nThe undercurrent rises from the fading coals.\nBlown tethered cross the plain far from sanctuary's gaze.\n...\n\n", 
        "Through the waxing through the waning.\nAmidst blackness a spark emerged.\nAnd we heaved death's branches upon the skyward flames.\nA haunting memory left as bile on the sand.\n...\n\n",

        "Chaos mirroring the eye of eternity.\nAs surely as the tightening grip of singularity.\nFrom the disgrace of life's mundanity.\nThe purveyors of immaculate imperfection.\nWe the purveyors of immaculate insurrection.\nWe will float through the fog like specters in time.\n...\n\n", 
        "Faces pressed against the earth tonight.\nAcknowledgement of the terrors inside.\nFacing the self effacing the self.\n...\n\n", 
        "A storm beyond what eyes can see but read my palm till the end.\nDeafening smoldered persistence a rift never destined for mend.\nA somber lament insignificance.\n...\n\n",

        "Life ends as leaves fall. Occam\u2019s razor strikes again.\nCan I dance if I have no soul?\nIf I go under will you find me cold?\n...\n\n"
