        "\"The last time we talked, Mr. Smith\nYou reduced me to tears\nI promise you it won't happen again.\"\n\nDo I attract you, do I repulse you\nWith my queasy smile?\nAm I too dirty? Am I too flirty?\nDo I like what you like?\n\nI could be wholesome, I could be loathsome\nI guess I'm a little bit shy\nWhy don't you like me, why don't you like me\nWithout making me try?\n\nI tried to be like Grace Kelly (Mmh)\nBut all her looks were too sad (Ah)\nSo I tried a little Freddie (Mmh)\nI've gone identity mad! (Mad, mad, mad)\n\nI could be brown, I could be blue\nI could be violet sky\nI could be hurtful, I could be purple\nI could be anything you like\n\nGotta be green, gotta be mean\nGotta be everything more\nWhy don't you like me, why don't you like me?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213978)",
