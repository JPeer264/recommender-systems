        "Oh love, where are we going\nWhere are you taking me\nWhy do our eyes play tricks on us\nA stranger where your body was\nAnd nothing where a mountain used to be\n\nI will follow you there\nI will follow you there\nTo wherever it is that you've gone\nWhere there's nothing to lose\nWhere you kick off your shoes\nAnd you put the legatee on\n...\n\n", 
        "It was a bad summer you said\nYou worked as a butcher in a yuppie store\nAnd you'd go home to cheap beer and say\nYou didn't know what you stayed in the city for\nAnd we were hog-tied to our demons\nWe just followed them around in a lonely haze\nAll through the swollen night time\nAnd the hot hot hot of the week days\n\nBut then we're making dinner\nAnd for once we stop bitching long enough\nTo hear the music and we dance\nTo Leonard Cohen in the kitchen\nAnd we just made it up the way we wanted to\nNothing easier to do\n...\n\n", 
        "One two three four five six seven\nThe word came down to him from heaven\nAnd naked as an animal he knew\nEverything of flesh and bone\nHe could call it all his own\nIf he could name it\nHe could lay claim to it too\nBut after all the word was spoken\nYou sent him out into the open\nAll alone to make his broken promise\nWhole again\nEight nine ten eleven twelve\nDid you see how far he fell\n...\n\n", 
        "The bedroom window view of chestnuts says it's morning\nIt's still dark and it's snowing\nThe floor is cold and the bed is warm\nIt's almost time I was going\nI put my wet boots on and walk on down\nTo the diner at the edge of Chinatown\nThe guys in hardhats will come in out of the cold\nThey want some coffee, they want something warm to hold\nOld Man Peter says he's ready to retire\nHe's taking off his yellow hat\nHasn't had a sick day since the day that we was hired\nAnd it's like he prides himself on that\n...\n\n", 
        "You and I were walking on the avenue\nIt was cold and we were old friends then\nTalking at each other\nYou asked me how I'd been and I could not complain\nI just put one foot before the other\nWe got where we were going\nAnd we drank a little wine\nAnd I forgot I had ever moved away\nCause Jason stayed played jazz guitar\nBoston still out-shown the stars\nAnd the first snow fell the very next day\nAnd I guess it's a little late\nBut I been thinking on it\nEver since you asked me\nAnd I say I'm doing fine\nJust I can't recall\nI did anything deliberately\nDeliberately\n\nYou and I were fearless in the wintertime\nWaking up at dawn\n...\n\n", 
        "This is what we do when we go to your place\nDrink two beers in the kitchen and talk about work\nListen to AFAX and act like we don't know what we're missing\nThis is what we do when we go to my place\nEat leftovers in my room, listen to folk\nTalk about last week and watch our old habits start resuming\nThen we tend to lay down in the same old bed\nAnd then we use it like a well-oiled machine\nAnd I tend to ask the ceiling up above your head\nHow we came to make love into this routine\n\nI don't even talk to anyone like we do\nEvery lie indecently exposed for what it is\nWhat is true, we're smarter than we were a week ago\n...\n\n", 
        "Riding on a sea of brass\nAnd colored beads and broken glass\nBehind a painted china mask\nShe might be looking at you\nShe's got her shade up to her chin\nA dirty little bourbon grin\nAnd all the saints go marching in\nTo try and get her number\nOrleanna\nOrleanna\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Bring it on\nI'll be waiting with my baby and the curtains drawn\nNo evening news\nJust our bodies and a record playing Delta blues\nBut he got a smile as wide as the road to hell\nWide as the road we're on\nAnd he wrote the song they sang when Rome fell\nIt goes, Put on your rock and roll shoes and come on\nYeah, come on\n\nDid we know\n...\n\n", 
        "Ome out, come on, come outside\nDon't you hide your handsome face from me\nI want to see you half-lit in the half-light\nLaughing with the whites of your dark eyes\nShining\nDarkly\n\nWay over yonder I'm waiting and wondering\nWither your fonder heart lies\n\n...\n\n",
