        "Im fanaticizing about doing a raindance in traffic.\nIm fanaticizing about a storm to wash me away.\nIf youd study the laugh-lines, youd see that Im cracking.\nI spent six months now feeling like dead weight\nThe fighter in me must have died a long time ago.\nI must have been watching his ghost;\nJust going through the motions, just putting on a face.\n\nIt feels like 1929 and Im on the verge of a great collapse today.\n\nEvery window in this house faces a brick wall.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

No good can come from this.\n\nI'm letting go. I've been holding on like poison ivy\nout of cold suburban concrete from this careless urban sprawl.\nI'm letting go. No we can't keep out of trouble.\nI thought my kids would call you uncle. I thought we'd never be alone.\n\nI've got images of you inside my head\noutside of the gas station where we always used to shoplift.\nIt's car-crash rhetoric. We fucked up everything we came in contact with\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
