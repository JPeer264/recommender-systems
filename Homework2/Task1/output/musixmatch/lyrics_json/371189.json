        "I'm done being brave\nThis bitter tongue won't save--me now\nWet from the rain\nLooking like you\nHandled like a jewel\nSearching some odd rule\nTo save me from the flames\nWhat the candle says...\n\"Keep me by the bed\nPet my weary head\"\nOh! If these walls could speak to me\nOr sing these eyes to sleep\nFor what is broken is in the past\nAs this perfect pitch won't last\nAnd so it goes\nThe bird sings low\nThe way i feel\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I take my licks -- like a man\nFacing forward\nI made my bed, it wasn't yours\n\nHow soon we'd forget -- what we shared\n\nYou said you'd always be mine\nI nodded and smiled\nTongue out of my head\nIs this love?\nOr the love of the chase?\nIs this love?\nTell me now, is it love?\nWe did the best that we can\nAcross the world\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
