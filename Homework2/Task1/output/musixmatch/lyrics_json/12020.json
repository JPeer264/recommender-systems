        "There's this friend of mine\nBeen doing time with the same girlfriend\nThat he's had for far too many of his days\nIt seems with each passing second\nHer brain lets loose\nThe one screw which holds back the rage\n\nThen she screams again, cries again\nAnd it loosens a little more\nIt's much more than a single soul can take\nAnd when it goes again tonight\nWell, we all know who she'll blame\n\nThis friend of mine called last week\nOn a payphone not too far from where he stays\nIt seems she lost her mind again that night\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
