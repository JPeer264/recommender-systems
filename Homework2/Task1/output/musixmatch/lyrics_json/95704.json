        "Sand Canyon hide away\nIn the dunes where we will stay\nWhile the powers that remain\nSend search parties out in vain\n\nWay down in So. Cal on those freeways\nThey overtook my in the fast lane\nThey tried to brake my boyish frame\nI swear I barely got away\n\nBut I return tonight to Sand Canyon\nWe'll hide away just like a band of bandits\nWe'll wipe the malls out of our minds, and slumber soundly 'neath the skies\nWe'll have a party out in sand canyon\n\nI'm goana spend the night in sand canyon\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
