        "Blow your fucking brains out\nBlow your fucking brains out\nTune that pale flame out,\nExtinguish the glow forever and in will come the sun.\n\nBlind your eyes, you are loved.\nTrust in her aim, you are loved.\nNow dance to the grave, you are loved.\nNo one will ever know who they are,\n\nSo blow your fucking brains out\nBlow your fucking brains out\n...\n\n", 
        "Sever the nerve, the skin, the scale\nGather your bones from beyond the pale\nCome out of the wild and into the world\nBurn all the books, put out your eyes\nLower your sword, the end is nigh\nSink through the pinewood and into the dirt\nOut of your body and into the sky\nOut of your body and into the sky\n\nGive in\nVoices will carry us\nTurn around\nFind your way back to the start\n\nLove is the way\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah\nAre you afraid of the dark\nI ain't worry but the seven has ... tonight\nWould you show me the things I've done\nGirl you know, I get ch-ch-ch-chills\nall the time my crooked spine\nKill the lives, kill the lives\n...\n\n", 
        "I should have drown in the flood with the rest\nI had the chance\nThe current was pitiless\nAnd proof of man was wiped from the face of earth\nThe song, the dance\nYeah, I should have gone with it\nAlas, I'm stranded alone in the wake\nNow I have lost all sight of the grave\nWhen did I ever say that I want to be saved\nI can see for miles but it don't look the same\nWhen no road has been paved go up\nGo up\n...\n\n", 
        "We opened the box and looked inside\nTwo animals, one is dead, one's alive\nAll we think we know is always wrong\nThe heavens fell in a thick awful shroud that covered the earth,\nbut there wasn't a sound\nNobody saw it so nobody heard it\nAll these equations won't solve the uncertain\nEverything's dead until it's alive\nMan will exist and then he will die\nJust take the ride\nJust take the ride\nSee it now\nSee it now\nShift the absurd and the reasoned around\n...\n\n", 
        "Pay no mind to the stranger in the 4 a.m.\nHe's not the one we know and he knows\nI slept through the war you waged with him for a little bit\nUntil he cracked your bones and you had to let go\nSo I make believe I've discovered peace\nBut i'll skin the man alive and sell the meat\nI'll wait in the dirt where he left your blood\nIf he returns for it I can make it right for good\nOh how I wish he would\nLost you in the overflowing fog that's been here awhile\n...\n\n", 
        "Peel off the leather and dig out your heart\nPeel off the leather and dig out your heart\nPeel off the leather and dig out your heart\nPeel off the leather and dig out your heart\n\nRight before your very eyes I slipped off the husk\nI mastered the slight\nThere's a getaway car that's been waiting my whole life\nThe engine has been running since the moment I arrived\nA trap door in the gallows let the charlatan out but smoke and mirrors box him in\nThe rags and the bones were such a burden that I thought I'd collapse\nAnd only when I surrendered them did I find I had what it takes to burn myself at the stake\nDid you smell a rat?\n...\n\n", 
        "There was gossip\nThere were pleas\nThere were rumors of meaning in meaningless things\nWidows readied their marital beds\nLitters of bastards gnawed at your breast\nThe filthy are first to be showered in love\nThe world's gone mad\nWe dress them in furs as they travel the earth\nSaints wear rags\nYou blessed our home\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm a great oasis\nYeah I'm a mirage\nI'm a beam of old light from a vanquished star and I'll only guide you into the dark\nI'm a parasite with a tapeworm\nYeah I got a bulletproof vest\nKnowing my bad luck I ain't ever gonna die so the good will never get any rest\nCome bail me out of the state I'm in\nThe drinks I've had are no match for the truth\nThe crowd down here put its teeth in us\nBut the cure's more dangerous than the venom is\nSo we leave it in and do those things that make us forget that we're dying here\nOh but we're dying here\nSo love the blood while you can\n...\n\n", 
        "All of a sudden you're dead\nThe ground cracks and takes you in\nYou've no time to be born again\nThere was nothing where something had been\nBut every grave that blooms is anchored in miles of roots\nIn the seed is the tree\nIn the flesh is the feast\nThere were worms in the hearts that you hoard\n...\n\n", 
        "All ways lead to the queen what cards she still holds she plays like a\nHangman her house is full of the broken hearted a suicide king and a pair of\nRusted spades she is gone a bit mad she wants her roses painted red but\nWe've yet to find the shade God save the queen she wears her suit on her\nSleeve her hourglass shape is a funhouse reflection heartbreaker don't let\n...\n\n", 
        "Eyes of celibates burning images worn down rotted lies lips dried peeling\nEyes separate our lives dead underneath your skin this blood's not mine you\nFucking whore you don't deserve my Gods you're a deified angel you leave me\n...\n\n", 
        "Strung by vein to running mouth your whispers are the catalyst somebody\nPlease breath lies my blood's not thick enough I can't hear my heart beat\nWhen you shut up still waiting for last rites still waiting on a goodbye\nKiss to sever the dead flesh and walk away a part of you please don't tell\n...\n\n", 
        "1, 2, 3, 4\nSign my farewell with the chimes of clock radio\n7 a. m. sun reveals a failed cherubim dangling from the rafters\nLike a sentimental ghost floating midway\nBetween the curse of the sky and you\n\nThis noose carries what atrophied wings can't\nDon't you want me disenchanted a deader shade of sorry\nBuried from the neck up in a slipknot\n\nDragging my feet through the dead air\nSuspended a fallen chair length from the ground\n...\n\n", 
        "Looking forward to a flatlined love affair the comfort of a dire\nLovesickness I've come to cherish bed sores and the salt in my own tears my\nBeautiful affliction your kiss festers like a boil I find myself ugly in\nYour eyes of asylum scenery have you come to take me away take me away\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight I'm coming home in a coma if it fucking kills me.\nListless but relieved, beaming like a newborn hostage.\nOrphaned by an ambulance. I got this new black eye just for you.\nYour hopeless romantic now helplessly rheumatic.\nPoets grinding teeth to powder. All my vowels are getting lost in the gauze.\nMisinterpret courting for the cursing of a drooling fool.\n...\n\n", 
        "This isn't at all unpleasant\nI'm enchanted by the lavish ballet\nAnd i'll whistle the tune all the way to the gallows that i heard At the caberet\nAt the sheriff's signal\nthe orchestra moves the floor\n\nDon't it make you feel wonderful?\nBody twisting strictly ballroom\nCriminally elegant\nIdeal pastured Viennese waltzer\n\nI'm dressed to kill\n...\n\n", 
        "What we're doing is so wrong\nAnd what you're wearing is so right, it's so tight\nBut I've never felt better, so I'm going out to get her\nAnd I don't care, I don't care what set of wheels I steal to get there\n\nBalance is a minor setback, what she thinks is all right\nAnd the way she looks is just fine\nShe sure as hell ain't you, but Lord knows she'll have to do\nShe don't know I'm alive but neither do I so there's nothing left to lose\n\nIf I could only make it make you want to want me\nOne more drink, I think should do\n...\n\n", 
        "Turns out I never had a thought at all.\nI've been talking in my sleep, reciting teleprompted anthems a marionette\nstrung tight to the executives upstairs.\nI almost had myself convinced that I meant everything I said. What a shame.\nOh captain, my captain, you've been drinking. What happened?\nI've been slurring my cadences and blacking out when I stand.\n...\n\n", 
        "Cut your break lines, brake your headlights and waited for you at the stop sign.\nDisconnected iron lungs, insurance fires, our smothered young.\nAlways the first one on the scene. A pyromantic midsummer nights dream.\n\nThank you lord:\n1) for this oil slick.\n2) for her car wreck.\n3) for I'm lovesick.\n...\n\n", 
        "To my mistress the bridge, I don't feel well\nI'll be leaving and you can't stop me\nWe've been carrying on too long\nWe've been carrying on too long, I'm sorry, but I'm gone\n\nI've got a bad reputation to think about\nI've been dirty\nI've been wrong\nMaybe someday they'll find that I've washed up\n\nI'm stepping out to clear my head\nI'm breathing in to fill my lungs\nWe're all dead, we're all dead\n...\n\n", 
        "Boys:\nShoot to thrill from the hip. It's time we put the \"act\" in action.\nWe've tricked these pigs into thinking that this auction is a pageant.\nIn no time there will be makeup on our new set of cutlery.\nThe livestock is star-struck. They're all salivating like ravenous cartoons.\nGoddamn animal.\nYou'd better watch were you spit.\n\nSqueal like soft music. If it helps, we'll dim the lights on the floor.\nNeon bulbs are the cosmetics of swine.\nEverybody looks quite dazzling dressed up in their formal attire.\nOh... you'd make a great secret if I could keep you,\nbut we all spill our guts.\n\nWe're locked and loaded.\nDrip-fed and bloated.\n...\n\n", 
        "No man abandon his post\nA gatecrasher has called us to arms\nTake up your torch\nI want this ship cleaner than a hospital ward\nA radical has polluted our ranks\n\nSlouch into position men, this is a war\nSet the traps, we'll have that criminals head\nMarched through the streets on a stick\nSomeone will pay for this\nWe'll squeeze his goddamn brains out\n\nSleep with one knife open\nYou can't out think us, we've been out of thoughts for a while\nYou can't out think us, we've been out of thoughts for a while\nAnd the warrior with the deadliest weapon is the one without\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight the cinema's the treatment clinic where the perverts seek the cure.\nShow me the rape scene one more time for the cause\nAnd I promise we'll behave like perfect christians.\nWe'll sing the glory of the gospel for some whiskey and a skin flick.\nHallelujah. All rise.\nHallow be my name.\nIn this kingdom we came without calling.\nHallelujah.\nThe violence and the choir,\nThe virgin and the fire.\nUp to her neck in tongues.\nUp to her neck in tongues.\n...\n\n"
