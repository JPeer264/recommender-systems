        "Take me to heart\nAnd I'll always love you\nAnd nobody\nCan make me do wrong\nTake me for granted\nLeaving love unsure\nMakes will power weak\nAnd temptation strong\n\nA woman's only human\nThis you should understand\nShe's not just a plaything\nShe's flesh and blood\nJust like her man\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We're caught in a trap\nI can't walk out\nBecause I love you too much baby\n\nWhy can't you see\nWhat you're doing to me\nWhen you don't believe a word I say, say, say?\n\nWe can't go on together\nWith suspicious minds\nAnd we can't build our dreams\nOn suspicious minds\n\nSo, if an old friend I know\nDrops by to say hello\nWould I still see suspicion in your eyes?\n\nHere we go again\nAsking where I've been\n...\n\n", 
        "All the things\nThat we've been through\nYou should understand me\nLike I understand you\nNow girl I know the difference\nBetween right and wrong\nI ain't gonna do nothing\nTo break up our happy home\nDon't get so excited\nWhen I come home\nA little late at night\nCos we only act like children\n...\n\n", 
        "If I should leave you\nTry to remember the good times\nWarm days filled with sunshine\nJust a little bit of rain\n\n...\n\n",

        "I've been crying (ooh, ooh)\n'Cause I'm lonely (for you)\nSmiles have all turned (to tears)\nBut tears won't wash away the fears\n\nThat you're never ever gonna return\nTo ease the fire that within me burns\nIt keeps me crying baby for you\nKeeps me sighin' baby for you\n\nSo won't you hurry\nCome on boy, see about me\n(Come see about me)\nSee about you baby\n(Come see about me)\n\nI've given up my friends just for you\nMy friends are gone and you have too\nNo peace shall I find\n...\n\n", 
        "As I walk this land of broken dreams\nI have visions of many things\nBut happiness is just an illusion\nFilled with sadness and confusion\n\nWhat becomes of the broken hearted\nWho have love that's now departed\nI know I've got to find\nSome kind of peace of mind\nMaybe\n\nFruits of love\nGrow all around (all around)\nBut for me they come a-tumbling down\n(come a-tumbling down)\nEvery day heart aches grow a little stronger\n(Just a little stonger)\n...\n\n",

        "As you brush your shoes\nStand before the mirror\nAnd you comb your hair\nGrab your coat and hat\nAnd you walk, wet streets\nTrying to remember\nAll the wild night breezes\nIn your memory ever\n\nAnd everything looks so complete\nWhen you're walking out on the street\nAnd the wind catches your feet\nSends you flying, crying\n\nOoo-woo-wee!\nWild night is calling, alright\nOooo-ooo-wee!\nWild night is calling\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, tell me where can you party, child, all night long?\nIn the basement, down in the basement, yeah.\nOh where can you go where your money gets low?\nIn the basement, down in the basement\nAnd if a storm is taking place, you can jam and still be safe\nIn the basement, down in the basement, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nWhere can you dance to any music you choose?\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't need no copy of Vogue magazine\nDon't need to dress like no beauty queen\nHigh heels or sneakers he don't give a damn\nMy baby loves me just the way that I am\nMy baby loves me just the way that I am\n\nHe never tells me I'm not good enough\nJust gives me unconditional love\nHe loves me tender and he loves me mad\nHe loves me silly and he loves me sad\n\nHe thinks I'm pretty\n...\n\n", 
        "Between the perfect world and the bottom line\nKeeping love alive in these troubled times\nWell, It's a miracle in itself\nAnd we know too well what that's about\nStill we made it through, only God knows how\nWe must've had a little help\n(Must've been)\n\nCHORUS\nWild Angels, Wild Angels\nWatching over you and me, yeah\nWild Angels, Wild Angels\nBaby what else could it be\n...\n\n", 
        "My heart's not ready for the rocking chair\nI need somebody who really cares\nSo tired of livin' solitaire\nSomeday I'm gonna be\nSafe in the arms of love\n\nStrip your heart and it starts to snow\nLove is a high-wire act I know\nSomeday I'll find a net below\n\nSomeday I'm gonna be\nSafe in the arms of love\n...\n\n", 
        "There you are in the early light of day\nThere you are in the quiet words I pray\nI've been blessed by the simple happiness\nOf the perfect love we've made\n\nEvery time I turn around\nWhen I'm lost and when I'm found\nLike an angel standing guard\nThere you are\n\nEvery time I take a breath and when I forget to breathe\nYou're watching over me there you are\nWhen I'm looking for the light in the middle of the night\n...\n\n", 
        "From the moment I catch your eyes\nMy life would seem so bright\nLoneliness's gone, and sadness far away\nHand's in hand, we feel so right\nLove has seen the light\nIt's new but you can't fear\n...\n\n", 
        "Red sun settin on the road behind her\nA hundred miles out of her hometown\nDrops a quarter in a beat up pay phone\nListens to it rattle on down\nVoice as cold as the phone she's holding\nThe connects way too clear\nHe's yelling where's my dinner\nShe's too far gone to care\nShe says listen here\n\nThere's a time to stand and the time is now or never\nA time to fly, time to let go forever\nA time to grow, and a time to discover\nLife is precious, every second\n...\n\n", 
        "Hold me like a wild flower\nFall around me like a sun shower\nKiss me like you're on fire\nAnd tell me what's underneath\nShow me\nI want you to show me\nWhat love is\n\nRun with me like a hell-bent gypsy\nScream for me from the highest balcony\nCarve my name on an old red door in Spain\nMake me immortal, make me immortal in your heart\nAnd show me\nI want you to show me\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah\n\nThe sun is shining everyday\nClouds never get in the way for you and me\nI've known you just a week or two\nBut baby I'm so into you I can hardly breathe\n\nAnd I'm in, so totally wrapped up\nEmotionally attracted, so physically acting\nSo recklessly I need you, so desperately sure as the sky is blue\nBaby I love you, I love you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Confetti fallin' from the sky\nMy hometown on the 4th of July\nA midnight snow on Christmas Eve\nLike standin' up for what you believe\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's how I feel when I'm with you\nThat's how I feel when I'm with you\n...\n\n"
