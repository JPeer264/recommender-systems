        "As I stood in the shade there beside him\nAnd as eyes turned to a paler shade of crimson\nAs I felt cold blood waves running down my spine\nThen I knew he wouldn't return\n\nMaybe I should have known (better)\nSome things we just have to bear\nI thought I could - still can't\nI saw it all coming down\n\n...\n\n", 
        "A rare silence you can't pay\nThe wishes, they are safe\nIn my box of treasure\nBut you smelled my life!\nThe warmth is sparkling inside\nThe luckiest miserable eyes I have seen\nThey shine through mountains so high\n\n\nI weep, I fall!\n'cause I have seen the light\n...\n\n", 
        "Haunted and drifted into a corner\nno open door in sight\ncircling around in a blizzard\npainfully rifted scars\n\n\nSurrender your sword!\nrescue your soul!\n\n\nDespondent\n'cause I have given\nsigns of unthoughtful crimes\nan act against my own heaven\n...\n\n",
