        "Well I don't mean to piss you off\nWith things I might say\nSo when I try to shut my mouth\nIt come out anyway\n\nSo when I speak my mind\nThat's when we connect\nYeah but that's not\nPolitically correct\n\nYour heads so filled with thought\nYou can't use your imagination\nLike a sky so filled with stars\nYou can't find a constellation\n\nIs everyone's so sensitive\nWith to any bad vibration?\nYou're so impressing\nWhile we're regressing\n\n'Cause I don't mean to piss you off\nThings I might say\nAnd when I try to shut my mouth\n...\n\n", 
        "She clings to me like cellophane\nFake plastic submarine\nSlowly driving me insane\nBut now that's over\n\nSo what if the sex was great\nJust a temporary escape\nAnother thing I grew to hate\nBut now that's over\n\nWhy\nWhy you always kick me when\nI'm high\nKnock me down till we see eye\nTo eye\nFigured her out\nI know she may not be Miss Right\nShe'll do right now,\nShe'll do right now\n...\n\n",

        "I'm not afraid to go backwards, fix what we broke\nMy gaze falls behind, you make desire seem so easy\nI hold off sleep, it's so silent without you here\nDon't give up now, it would all be for nothing\n\n'Coz, I believe in second chances\nI believe the years forget\n\nSo let me fill these empty spaces\nBetter late than never, stay forever\nLet me fill this empty space\n'Coz, there's always room for one more mistake\n\nCan you feel that?\n...\n\n",

        "All she's asking is for a little more time,\nTo walk away from his anger and leave the bruises far behind\nShe won't talk about it... she's made up her mind\nBut as the front door shuts behind her she whispers \"give me a sign.\"\n\nFeels the power of the engine as she climbs to 65\nEvery piston sounds like freedom, every white line says goodbye\nShe'll find strength in her anger and the truth in his lies\n...\n\n", 
        "Fames what she's wanting\nNot a face in the crowd\nJust a disposable pop star\n\nStaring down from 30 thousand feet above the planet\nShe gets the sense nothing's behind her anymore\nHer quest for fame has left her nothing short of a fanatic\nFor the chance to be the one that we adore\n\nFame's what she's wanting\nYou can't go too far (when thats who you are because)\nFame's what she's wanting\n...\n\n", 
        "Once inside the door I check my face in the mirror,\nAs I look past this lonely minute\nWas this the ride worth waiting for\nI'm scared to death that now I've missed it\nBut she was not the only stone\nSkipped across this gravel road leading down the path of loneliness\nSo I'll fly from this hate, pray my soul the lord will take me\nTo a place through time and indifference\n\n...\n\n",
