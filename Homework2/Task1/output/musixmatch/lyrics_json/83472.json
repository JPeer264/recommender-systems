        "Last Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day you gave it away\nThis year to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day you gave it away\nThis year to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nOnce bitten and twice shy\nI keep my distance, but you still catch my eye\nTell me baby, do you recognize me?\nWell, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me\n\nHappy Christmas\n\nI wrapped it up and sent it\nWith a note saying, \"I love you\", I meant it\nNow I know what a fool I've been\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
