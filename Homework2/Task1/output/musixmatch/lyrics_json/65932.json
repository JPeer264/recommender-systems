        "Soon\n\nYeah I know that your pockets low\nGot nowhere and no place to go\nTime is moving but you're going slow\nSo long x 3\n\nYeah it's hard and you seem alone\nLove will guide you to your throne\nThrough the dark & rain you'll glow\n\nLike a shining star you are\nBorn to play a part you are\nA universal sound\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
