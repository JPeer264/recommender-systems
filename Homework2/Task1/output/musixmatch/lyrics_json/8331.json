        "Jason: Alright guys, whats up? Let's tear this fucken place DOWN!\n\nA cup of two day old coffee\nYou're feeling like yourself again\nYou're still on your own\nYou've survived another night\nIn this dingy room with the same four walls\n\nLooking in the mirrors getting easier these days\nthat old friend anger is losing its hold on you\nthe key to survival in this crazy world\nand it's good to see you're still standing strong\n\nnot too long ago you were tearing at a world\nthat would never let you in\nstrung out, outcast turned away\nyou kept your face to the ground\nand fought the world with your silence\n...\n\n", 
        "No one knows where\nI buried my sweet Virgina Madison\nthe winter chill falls over me\nand keeps me numb inside\nunder the moon by the edge of town\nshe'll quietly wait for me\nI promised it wouldn't be too long\ntill I returned to sleep with her\nshe said she don't wanna live no more\nwell I don't mind\nno I don't mind\nso now I'm waitin' for the crack of dawn\nto head on back there\n...\n\n", 
        "this god damn car is broken down again looks like i'm sleepin' in the back and i'll be dreamin' of a better place\nonly to call you in the morning with the same excuse again\nby the side of the freeway watchin' all the cars go by\ni think tomorrow will be the day i get my shit together and give up this crying game\ni've been here before i know i'll be here again\ni don't know why but it don't feel the same\n\nfor one moment i can see clearly\nthe weight of the world don't seem so bad\nthen i find myself here right back where i started from again\n...\n\n", 
        "It's four o' clock\nThe TV's on\nMy mind is shut off and my own thoughts are gone\nI change the channel\nI change my mind\nI change my life I want to leave it all behind\n'Cause I don't have a mind of my own\nI am influenced by everything I see\nAnd I can't help it now\nEverything in my life just thinks for me\n\nCan't help this habit I'm in love with my disease\n...\n\n", 
        "I never had a reason to believe in anything\nI never had a cause that I could fight for\nI never had too much of anything to call my own\na drunk mother and father of four\nall my life I grew up watchin' others dreams come true\nand how I waited for my day in the sun\nevery day I worked harder\nand I got further in debt\ntill I realized that day was never gonna come\n...\n\n", 
        "I find myself here once again\nunder clouds of indecision\nreflections looking right through me\nI can't believe the lies we tell ourselves\nthe music used to be everything\nthe music used to heal\nbut business soon becomes reality\nand nothing left inside is real\n...\n\n", 
        "A look of discontentement fills your hazel eyes\nAs I ask for the millionth time what's goin' on?\nYou seem to be confused about just where you stand with me tonight\nAs we tear apart all that wasn't lost to another fight\n\nAnd so we turn against each other once again\nYou run and I go hide\nTalkin' to myself again 'bout all the things I should've said\nAnd I wait for you\nI still wait for you\n\nI wanna know where this is going\nAnd do we still have a chance to save what we haven't lost again\nI made a promise to myself no to let this go\nBut now I need to see this trough\n...\n\n", 
        "I can feel the murky grip\nof a cold depression comin' down\nI can feel her hands around my neck\nshake me to the ground\nice burn of the soul\nin light in sickness and in death\ninfected every word and every thought\nand every single breath\ntwisted by design\nthe creeps deep inside of me\n...\n\n", 
        "Jason: 1! 2! 3! 4!\n\nOne o one point one Fahrenheit\nTo some it's a fever, to her it's just right\nand I can't hold her\nand it's bringin' me down\nher blood runs hot but her heart beats cold\nshe's a devil with an angels face I've been told\nI think I'll push my luck next time you're around\n\nWell I'd walk through fire for you\nI'd burn in hell to make it all true\nI never loved anyone else in this world but you\nA thousand reasons why I try to prove to you\nI'm not the other guy\nI don't give a damn what other people think (Ah!)\n\nShe walked my way with that sick, fucked up smile\n\n...\n\n", 
        "grey sky man is talking to the sidewalk once again\nyour perfect vision of the world it goes unheard\nas the rain falls down on your head it slips inside the cracks of another fruitless day\nhere in the land of king alvarez\n\nyou're losing once again\nit's getting harder to survive when the world that's all around you just don't seem to care\nand the universe you've built for yourself is caving in right on you\nand the streets are getting colder then they used to be these days and now\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(Jason makes weird sounds, like a bird of some sort. That's right a bird.)\n\nI kneel to you when you preach to me\nyou're my god you're my tv\nyou control what i say you control what i hear\nyou control what the Fuck\nMy whole existence revolves around this cable to my mind.\n...\n\n", 
        "when i was young, america meant to me\n-- land of the beautiful and land of the free.\nnow i look around and all i see are americans in poverty.\nwe're all lost without a trace we can't keep up,\n...\n\n", 
        "you gave in to your vice so quickly.\nnow i die alone among these people i don't know.\nand faces i've not seen--your masquerade it made me blind\nwell now i see what i must do. don't know where i must go,\nto run from tonight. we're gonna drag each other down again,\n...\n\n",

        "here i am today it seems i'm stoned once again\nwait for the people and things that ruin my day\nas i sit away and take another hit i smoke another bong\nload and it seems i'm really lit\ntalk about the things that no one ever wants to hear\n...\n\n", 
        "the secret, kept safely hid in your mind,\nbetrays you when you look into my eyes.\nbroken are the bonds that used to bind you and i.\nbroken like a promise bred from your world of lies.\nbroken are the dreams, the ones you let slip away.\nbroken, broken, broken\ntrust me: two words i've heard once before.\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a blood stain on the floor by the door\nWhere your whole world fell and died\nThere's a silent chair in the corner of the room\nWhere you sat alone and cried\n\nWell she got something to say to you\nBut the words never mean a thing\nSo she took that needle to her pain and set herself free\n\nBurn\nBurn it to the ground\nBurn\n\nWhen times got tough you got a little tougher\nThen you slowly fell behind\n...\n\n", 
        "do you believe there's hope for your kind,\nthat your insatiable quest for direction will one day\nhelp you find veracity and meaning to your existence as a whole,\n...\n\n", 
        "underneath the moon in a place far away\ni know a place where we can run away.\nif you belive in me and you let me lead the way.\ni take your pain, i'll wish it all away. so far away.\ni'll take you by the hand, tell you never to fear\n...\n\n",
