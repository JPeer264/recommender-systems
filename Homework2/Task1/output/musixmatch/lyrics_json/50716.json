        "Nothing hurts like the truth, a piece of perfidy, a deceitful behaviour,\nwomen's lures, deserted like an empty corpse, an uneasy conscience.\n\nStigmatised in hell, he's puffed up with conceit,\nthere will come a day of retribution, they're just lost dreams,\n...\n\n", 
        "Desperate into shadows of pain, you never believed,\nI've heard it all before, beyond the frontiers of his miserable world,\nblazing souls abandoned in a perpetual journey.\n\nThe pain distorted his face, killing one another, and after,\n...\n\n", 
        "Hoping for a vision, think of all the dreams you have lost,\nyour actions will resound forever in eternity,\ncan anyone listen to your heartrending lament this last time.\n\nYou build castles in the air with an ingratiating smile.\nThe road of the solitary traveller, psalmodys and elegys\nthat had been heard and forgot in the vale of tears.\n\n[CHORUS:]\n...\n\n", 
        "A tortured soul, this fear preyed upon my mind,\nhow I wish to get away from this ill-fated circle of hallucinations,\n\nIt's beyond my comprehension,\n\nI was deceived into believing that he might mend his ways,\ndon't delude yourself, a fixed match, as the evening wore on,\n...\n\n", 
        "Destroyed monuments and strange sounds,\na frightening sunbeam overshadow the screams of despair,\nroaming at the endless plains of grief,\nhiding from a world so cruel searching for the light.\n\nWalking around demolitions and thorns,\nwaiting for the charming fairies,\npain and destruction, miserable pleasures\nand black and white jollity.\n\n...\n\n",

        "Bring of the darkness, the mutiny\nStrike down upon the insanity\nSilent wastelands our homes tobe\nCondemned to harvest our broken dreams\n\nI am the fear within your hearts\nFlags of war drenched in guilt\nThe desperation I leave will shake\n...\n\n", 
        "Perished are all doubts. Perished are all fears.\nPerished into nothingness. I found that nothing dies.\nStop to reflect. Stop to resist.

        "Without pain or sigh like the dead,\nThe obliteration of the human civilization\nWithin the range of the human mind\nYou don't feel sorry for anything\nYou don't feel anything\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Revenge will strike hard without any mercy.\nInvoking dark clouds to cover silent lives.\nIn ancient sermons by man long abolished.\nYou and I find comfort once again.\nA lesson learned too late.\nWaiting to seal our fate.\nYou drive the poison,\nInto the wounds of my heart.\n...\n\n", 
        "Maybe you don't know. What is joy or sorrow.\nYou feel so abandoned suppress your feelings.\nThat's the legacy of destiny.\nI don't know if you'll find out the truth. The peace in your heart.\nThe realm of fantasy. To the world's end. In all my life confronting the danger.\n\n(Chorus:)\n...\n\n", 
        "All our mysteries remain unsolved. Now when my blindfold is cast.\nNo judgement cast upon them.\nThey who broke their vows that i trusted in and all that i saw of their eyes.\nWas the dead stare behind their masks.\nA new desease is born.\nUncurable and scorned. Watch as their smiles go black.\nStabbed in the back.\nOh, the solitude and the days of pain.\nI'm awake through the nightmares of life.\nAnd your thoughts never travel to them.\nThem you stepped upon to reach your place.\nAnd all that i saw of my dream.\n...\n\n", 
        "Empty dreams.\nVacuous life.\nWhere in lies the truth?\nWhere is the world that we have dreamed of?\nA well constructed wisdom.\nStormy thoughts.\nSpirited obstinacy. And the moon was obscured by the clouds.\nA vicious circle. A smouldering fire.\nFar away from the hopes of the soul.\n...\n\n", 
        "Every day, every hour, every moment.\nWhy don't you say something?\nThe surface politeness, these are the faults that can't be remedied.\nIs it joy or sorrow?\nHuman beings are made to destroy each other.\n\n[Chorus:]\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh faithfull ones we are lost again.\nIn this violent sea of entrapping lies.\nWe are gathered here as long ago.\nOthers like we in search of clarity.\nThe mighty gifts they blind us with.\nReaching in and stealing our only dream.\nThat dream of freedom found dead its cradle at dawn.\n\n(Chorus:)\nBy fear plagued since birth.\n...\n\n"
