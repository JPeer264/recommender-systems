        "Sit Still, and close your eyes\nWhat's behind the other door\nNo more silence, don't kill this thing we got called love\nJust searching for the perfect drug\n\nWhen Love comes calling\nDon't look back\nWhen love comes calling\n...\n\n", 
        "We're all searching, time's unfolding\nTrying to fill our lives with meaning\nStill we're learning how to breathe\nAmongst the pain and suffering\n...\n\n", 
        "Open your world into everything\n\nSubtle ripples forming closer\nTouching me, I can't escape\nFoolishly I think I'm stronger\nThen a kiss, now it's too late\n\nOpen your world into everything\n...\n\n", 
        "I brought you some something close to me\nAnd left with something new\nI can see through your head\nYou haunt my dreams\nBut theres nothing to do but believe\nJust believe\nJust breathe\nAnother day\nJust believe\nAnother day\nJust breathe\nAnother day\nJust believe\nAnother day\nJust breathe\nI'm used to it by now\nAnother day\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't put a smile upon your face no more\nI can't make your heart shine like it did before\nYou don't listen to my stories anymore\nYou can't comfort me the way you did before\n\nWas I too loud? Was I too bad?\nWas I too open?\nWas I too high? Was I too fast?\nWas I too close?\n...\n\n", 
        "I did it today, I made myself say\nAnd I take back my tears, my sight, my love\nNo more does your magic work\nOn my heart\nNo more will your words ever tear me apart\n\nI know now for certain\n...\n\n"
