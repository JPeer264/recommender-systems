        "Prowling in the night\nHiding 'neath my fright\nManipulate my sight\nThief\n\nWhenever you steal\nMy punishment's real\nYou gave me sorrow\n\nInvading my own value\nParading my shy security\n...\n\n", 
        "Bleak desolation in a beam of sun\nScraping as I crawl (your heart can't hear me)\nTearing, bruising fall (your hands can't hear me)\nThirsting, raging, blind (your eyes can't hear me)\nRacing against time (your arms can't hear me)\n\nLike an angel you'll come\nIn a dream, precious one\nMake me beautifully numb\n\n...\n\n",

        "To others the pain was obvious\nThe colours of shame, a bruise unjust\nAbuse of trust can't be wiped\n\nI can't remember why\nI chose to say goodbye\nI'm terrified of what I might have severed\n\nI tried to forget the drowning truth\n...\n\n",
