        "Harmony always, when I look around me\nAnd your smile I see,\nI can feel it surround me.\nA miracle I find in your company.\n\n\nOne glance is all that I need.\nWhat I was searching for, I've found it.\n\n\nCan you believe it, I'm walking on water\nAnd I'm high off the ground.\nMust be some mystique that weaves it.\nI'd never have thought of this power I've found.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",

Yeah!\n\nYou're a hostage of the heart,\nTwisted 'round the smallest finger.\nTwo burning eyes are tearing you apart,\nTurn your soul into a cinder.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
