        "Nothing quite ever comes out right\nWhen you try to say something clean\nIt's hard to hide from the thrashing nights\nNobody cares about a junkie's dream\n\nMore of a sucker than a fiend\nIt's hard to turn down a smiling friend\nWhen everything becomes a scene\nYou can't make old dreams brand new again\n\nY la monoton\u00eda es un asesino lento\nY la monoton\u00eda es un asesino lento\nUn asesino lento\n\nSleep will get in the way most times\nDreams will lead you to the middle of nowhere\nStill rather hitch a ride on a dream\n...\n\n", 
        "Fuera del trabajo por la ma\u00f1ana\nHasta en el amanecer\nTodos mis problemas de dinero\nDondequiera que voy vengo a lo largo\n\nLa preocupaci\u00f3n es un mat\u00f3n\nEso no me deja ser\nTratando de mantenerme ocupado\nForcejeando y luchando\n\nSin hogar desde el incendio\nEl cenicero y yo no podemos sentar la cabeza\nEstoy seguro de donde estoy atado\nAs\u00ed que me hundo otra ronda\n\nPlacebo para el dolor\nY no hay nadie para culpar\nMe niego a aceptar\nQue mi trabajo es en vano\n\nLa preocupaci\u00f3n es un mat\u00f3n\nEso no me deja ser\nTratando de mantenerme ocupado\n...\n\n", 
        "You're playing other chiks\nSometimes you're hiding\nYou take anything\nIf you don't have to buy it\nYou have no way to\nAnd...\nDo whatever it takes\nSo it never has to end\n\nJust cause it feels good\nDoesn't mean its right\nI know it sounds like it should\nBut that just isn't life\nLife has consequences\nFor all our actions\nNo one should suffer\nJust for your satisfaction\n...\n\n", 
        "I was tripping down blackstar road\nIt's where I found my new coyote coat\nI took her home and showed her to the buck knife\nI hung her out on my tree so she could dry\nBut this wasn't your usual roadkill\nIt held the curse of the Little Miss Jack spell\n\nSoon as I stepped out of my home\n...\n\n", 
        "My spine just squinted and my eye is weak\nI can't find peace in a form of speech\nMy views change color red hot, ice cold\nBlack ain't a color happiness ain't gold\nIt's hard for me to feel normal easy to feel free\nIt's hard for you to understand if you can't feel me\nI ain't in a western in a way I can grasp\nI try to hold on to something that is fast\n...\n\n", 
        "A man with no god stated to pray\nFor a chance and a shot to win back his name\nHe used to have a whole lot but he threw it away\nAnd all that he loved was washed down the drain\nOh man on no he had no where else to go\n...\n\n", 
        "The summer is here\nAnd the red tide's near\nThe day breaks brown\nBut when the sun goes down\nThe faces shine bright\nThrough the whole night\nHer glow hypnotizes\nAs the sea drops and rises\n...\n\n", 
        "I was there too but I got out\nSome stood still and some layed down\nI saw the forming of a frozen mind\n...\n\n", 
        "They drug me down to the old cold river\nThey're gonna throw me in\nCuz I've been caught sleeping with the daughter\nOf the only man in town who can swim\nI'm facing the old cold river my back against the wind\nThey gon' throw me down to the bottom of the river\nNever to rise again\nI sink down, down to the old cold bottom\nDown, to rest with the fish\nI sink down, down to the old cold bottom just as the old man wished\nThe sea sleeps and the moon is hanging\n...\n\n", 
        "Believe in the trip\nThe more that you learn\nYou find you don't know shit\nQuit trying to know it all\nSometimes it's ok to be wrong\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Haven't had the guts,\nNo i haven't had the balls,\nTo tell you all about,\nThe thoughts I can't keep out,\n\nDon't wanna fall asleep,\nI don't wanna fall asleep,\nBut i'm running out of ways\nTo kill all of the sheep\n\nShe\u2019s been coming in my head\nThere\u2019s a devil in our bed\nI cannot keep her concealed\nAnd I can\u2019t shake that she ain\u2019t real\n\nShe tells me that you\u2019re dead\nThat you just picked up and left\nAnd knowing that she lies\nDoesn\u2019t dull her piercing eyes\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When Jimmy thinks he found his home\nWith smiling faces and room to grow\nHe's put back on the stranger's road\nNever looking back and never letting go\n\nHe needs time to try his heart\nWhy even build or ever start\nIf he'll just get torn apart\n\nBefore he even gets a chance\nTo say goodbye and pack your bags\n...\n\n",

        "I'm a go down to the corner of Beach and\ndance in the street to the barnacle beat\nI'll stand in the traffic and whale and I'll dance\nand smile as the plastics trip as they glance\nmaybe they won't find me crazy\nthe first ones to come are always the young\n...\n\n",
