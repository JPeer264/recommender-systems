        "Path I travel is much too long\nHoles in my shoes they're coming on strong\nCan't you hear the blues in my last two songs\nGotta help me keep on carrying on carrying on\n\nFlat foot sound of the horses hooves\nDoesn't mean you harm only bringing you news\nRun home, run home black dog at my side\nKeep you guessing in my mood like I'm coming and going I'm a lunatic type\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
