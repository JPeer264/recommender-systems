        "Sanctus Satanas! Praised be the Lord, the raging Beast!\nHe who deceived the whole world. The first and the last.\nAlpha and Omega. I acknowledge thee as my lodestar!\nYour will, my burden, yet greeted with the utmost bliss.\nMy body, your temple, a grotesque shell, limbs deformed.\nVeins dried out but my heart burns with Luciferian pride.\nFor the abiding of His will calls for the negation of the self.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I feel the poison seeping in my veins, \nI've drunk the liqueur through the flesh of Hell\nHis throat is never satisfied! \nDesire of the horned needs a sinful delight\n\nA holy divine journey within his blessing light\nThe birth of a malign tumor, rewarding betrayal\nI stole the chalice, I ate the bread, mystery revealed\nHis nectar runs into my heart, my sweet blessing wine! \n\nVisions out of mine, \n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Words of Satan came expressly to me, \nHis hand was there upon all\nWe looked, and behold a whirlwind came out\nA great cloud and an infinity fire\nSo bright! \nAnd inside the mist has the color of blood\n\nAnd then came darkness\nFour living creatures\nWith rings full of eyes; \nThey went straight forward\nBurning calls of hate\nWitnessing the treason\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Specters fall across the shadow flames of void; \nFly from spheres they shan't dwell in forever\nRushing down, engulfed by putrid texture; \nThe unseen... \nThe master rule supreme! \n\nAfter black living Robe, fabric of the insane\nSwarming horror, million tails of the Beast\n\nThey are outcast so restless, diminished yet keen\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

Father! \nMay your thorns pierce the flesh of men! \nAnd may sinners live above ashes of your glory\n\nTrumpets! \nResound to toll the knell of their death\nMercy unto you and hate and plague be multiplied\n\nTo those who are sanctified by Satan the Lord, \n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Light is sour blood spilled from pregnant skies.\nFrothing & turning, ignoring dead wings as they drift by.\nIt reveals blood & rust from twisted faces.\n\nLong shadows are the devil & death the cold breeze.\nCoughing & choking in the fading night, I smiled... \nThe fruit of labour grew in the fertile world.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Spirits in wings, a thousand seraphs bursted.\nDark flames still hovering on their baneful flight.\nDeath in all but the putrid breath that fell,\nRefracted, through thy bounds, afar.\n\nO Death! from the eye of Satan upon that star!\n\nSweet was that error \u2013 Better still than breath \u2013\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Fractured delight, the spirit bends\nStill this body never breathed.\n\nAffected glimpses, behind my lonely hill of strangeled shadows, \nHave fled.
