        "Weird Al\nMiscellaneous\nSmells Like Nirvana\nSmells Like Nirvana\nWeird Al\n(Kurt Cobain/Nirvana/Al Yankovic)\nWhat is this song all about?\nCan't figure any lyrics out\nHow do the words to it go?\nI wish you'd tell me, I don't know\nDon't know, don't know, don't know, oh no\nDnn't know, don't know, don't know\n\nNow I'm mumblin' and I'm screamin'\nAnd I don't know what I'm singin'\nCrank the volume, ears are bleedin'\nI still don't know what I'm singin'\nWe're so loud and incoherent\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm nowhere that I've ever been\nI'm no one, I can't remember me\nMake it all go, you're showing me heaven\nYour door is always closed\nLike the church doors are\nWhen you need a little Jesus\nOutside His business hours\nYou know, where were you\nWhen I needed you to\nHold me\nGive a little beat of your heart to me\nYou've got to hold me\nIt's like the rhythm of life to me\nYou've got to hold me\nA little beat of your heart to me\n...\n\n"
