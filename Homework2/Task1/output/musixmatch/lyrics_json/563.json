        "I feel your eyes upon me\nHow should I act today\nTo feel so unsure always\nGive up or now keep on this way\n\nThe silence taps my elbow\nIt's good, least that's what she said\n\nI could run but I stand and greet it\nBoredom won't starve as long as I feed it\nThe world drips down like gravy\nThe thoughts of love so hazy\nEveryone's ideal of fun\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I sit queasy, jittered, uneasy.\nThe toll that looms, the loss I dread.\nI buckle when my judge clutches,\nQuestioning my treatment of an ego underfed.\nBulbs of passion, bulbs of passion.\n\nPlace it here on the bureau,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "It's floating through the abyss.\nUnder the brig, my head swings down.\nBeware her wrath, the image gone.\nThe shell is crumbling, fix my frown.\n\nThis spell would be clear in non-tradition,\nAnd stepping on these pieces of pain and smirk.\nAnd rape goes through to sin my eyes,\nAnd shapes know where the heartache will lurk.\n\nForget the swan, a stone swims near.\nA stone has come, if I could cheer.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
