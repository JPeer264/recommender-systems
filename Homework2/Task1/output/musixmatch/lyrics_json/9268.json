Tell me why daddy is walking away - leaving me!\"\n\nI remember birds of pray, dark shadows piercing the ground!\nFaceless men came shouting about a pride to which we were bound.\nAnd oh, I searched for him so!\n\"Faith darling, have faith my son! Your daddy is winning a war...\"\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
