        "Loneliness is the coat you wear\nA deep shade of blue is always there\nThe sun ain't gonna shine anymore\nThe moon ain't gonna rise in the sky\nTears are always clouding your eyes\nWhen you're without love\nBaby\nEmptiness is the place you're in\nNothing to lose, but no more to win\nThe sun ain't gonna shine anymore\nThe moon ain't gonna rise in the sky\n...\n\n", 
        "You whisper in my ear\nAll the things I wanna hear\nYou say you're sorry and you can change\nIf I give you one more chance\n\nBut I've heard it all before\nYou can't hurt me anymore\nAll the lying and all the pain\nNow there's nothing left to break\n\nI know what you're feeling\nDon't it hurt now\nI hope it hurts so bad\n\nCry\nI wanna see the tears in your eyes\nFor me\nYou've thrown it all away\nThere's nothing you can say\nJust cry\n...\n\n"
