        "You preach to me as if it matters\nNever worrying about yourself\nOr the wrong you've done\nThink you know the way\nWant me to follow you\nSelfish lies you're set out to prove\nSo what if you had your faith\nYou should realize\nRealize that you're already dead\n\nYou fall\n...\n\n", 
        "Dark room open\nNo light for years\nNo way to find out\nHow long has it been\n\nScreams heard from a distance\nThe shredding sounds of pain\nLooking for reasons\nSlowly becoming insane\n\nFor eyes staring\nSuch evil eyes\nPicturing them\nNo longer alive\n\nAccidental\nUnintentional\nYears ago\n...\n\n", 
        "Face to face, no time to waste\nThis is the time for revenge\nYour claim to fame of crushing dreams\nYour control has no hold on me, has no hold on me\n\nI hate the way, you have no shame\nYou act like nothing's happened\nIt's time to rise, the final fight\nThis is the last time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "How many times can it change\nHow long will I be restrained\nIt's appalling to think that\nAll my time seems to be wasted\nWill it stop or is it only beginning\n\nHere on the inside\nMy life is not over\nI'm down again\nI'm down again\nMy life is not over\nI'm down again\nI'm down again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I have told you things need to change\nYou never listened or came to my aid\nThe vicious cycle has not changed\nMy time's spent rearranged\n\nMotherfuck it all\nI can't stand this\nRemember when I said\nEveryone makes me sick\nWell nothing has changed\n\nI hate everyone\nI hate everyone\n\nThis vicious cycle still remains\nConstant clusterfuck, bloodstains\n...\n\n", 
        "Explode\n\nClear the way the new king has arrived\nTo take your place while I've got you on your\nknees\nI always had this vision of who I'd become\nA powerful giant who could rule with ease\nAnd who would\n\nBring the truth\nI will bring the truth\nYour time is up-there's no chance left for you\n...\n\n", 
        "As I lay this all to rest shadows appear reminding me\nOf all things left unsaid unsaid\n\nMaybe one day you'll believe that I will crawl\nI will crawl on broken knees\n\nIt's beyond what you really need forcing it all out of you\nWill I make your life complete come clean\n\nMaybe one day you'll believe that I will crawl\n...\n\n", 
        "Ever want to commit murder\nFeel the rush as you kill\nLooking into dead eyes\nCollecting their last thoughts\nSometimes I feel no remorse\nSometimes I want a taste\nWhy am I so different\nThan those who can just do it\n\nI want to change what I've become\nBut I can't kill the urge\nBut I can't kill the urge\nYou are now mine forever\nWalk with me one last time\nYou'll walk with me one last time\n...\n\n", 
        "This rage has overcome\nNo more will I shun\nThese thoughts I've had\nThis lie I've lived\nI let them put the blame on me\nEngulfed in hate\nRetaliate\nYou can't conceal these thoughts\nYou can't disguise this rage\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In this present darkness\nI fall\nFall upon broken knees\nCrawl through weight of depression\nHaunted by an unborn ghost\nI'll never know your fears\nNever see me in your eyes\nCurse the one that stole your name from me\n\nThis is the monster that\n...\n\n", 
        "Face I am nothing face complete by sarcastic tastes\nWhat a waste I think I'd rather die\nWanting never gaining I find myself pondering life\nAlways situations I can never hide\n\nCrying tears of anger, hate, depressed\nI never know the me, never know what to do\nSlit pour out the life a bottle of the vive\nA desperate cry for something else to justify\n\nI'm in a daze caused by pain\nA failing force that wants to change\nPainting the white to gray\nPainting the white to\n\nNumb body shivering\nBlood dripping from the skin\nPainting the white to gray\nPainting the white to\n\nPlastic always drastic\n...\n\n", 
        "I've always searched for an answer\nFor my convictions\nA troubled mind at 15\nDemonic visions\nI saw you raped and beaten\nThrown down like a rag\nWho the hell is this monster\nThat surrounds my brain\n\nI try to make some sense of this\nTry to break this mold\nDivination\nA power I wish I didn't have\n...\n\n",

        "You are god's most beautiful creation\nFrom the moment I set my eyes upon you\nI knew I wanted to be\nFeel your arms wrap around me\nAnd to share myself with you\nWould be nothing but'\nKnowing you would make me whole again\n\nAnd then she said 'no\n\nI cry out to help you\n...\n\n",
