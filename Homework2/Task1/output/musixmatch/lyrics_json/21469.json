That is the question\nBut I forget you don't expect an easy answer\nWhen something like a soul becomes initialized\nAnd folded up like paper dolls and little notes\nYou can't expect a bit of folks\n\nSo while you're outside looking in\nDescribing what you see\nRemember what you're staring at is me\n\n'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAll I know is that it feels like forever\nBut no one ever tells you that forever feels like home\nSitting all alone inside your head\n\n...\n\n",
