You know who can say?\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)", 
        "Everyday I love you less and less\nIt's clear to see that you've become obsessed\nI got to get this message to the press\nThat everyday I love you less and less\n\nAnd everyday I love you less and less\nI've got to get this feeling off my chest\nThe doctor says all I need is pills and rest\nSince everyday I love you less and less\n\nUnless, unless\nI know, I feel it in my bones\nI'm sick, I'm tired\nOf staying in control\nOh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel\nI got to know what's not and what is real\n\nOh yes, I'm stressed\nI'm sorry I digress\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)"
