        "She reads a book from across the street,\nWaiting for someone that she'll never meet.\nTalk over coffee for an hour or two, She\nwonders why I'm always in a good mood.\nKillin' time before she struts her stuff,\nShe needs supporting, I'll become the crutch.\nShe'll never know how much she means to me.\nI play the game but I'm the referee.\n\nSurrender every word, every thought every sound.\nSurrender every touch, every smile, every frown.\nSurrender all the pain we've endured until now.\nSurrender all the hope that I lost you have found.\nSurrender yourself to me.\n\nEven though I know what I'm lookin' for,\nShe's got a brick wall behind her door.\nI'd travel time and confess to her,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
