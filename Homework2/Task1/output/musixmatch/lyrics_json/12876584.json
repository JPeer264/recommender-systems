        "I bring the light\nYou get to see\nYou bring the love\nIt's ecstacy\n\nI see no point in what you're thinking\nI'm going out I'm talking you drinking\nI get the car, you're getting up\nI'm standing tall, well fucking tough\nIt's just your way, you hear me wrong\nI hear you say you're getting up, getting up\n\nBaby hold on\nBaby come on\nBaby come on\nYou're gettin up, gettin up\nBaby hold on\n...\n\n", 
        "The beat breaks down so we pick it up,\nThe floor shakes down but it's not enough,\nThe beam is up and the kids are high,\nI've seen them move and it blows my eyes,\nThe floor's an ocean and this wave is breaking,\nYour head is gone and your body's shaking,\nThere is nothing you can do 'cause there is no solution,\nYou gotta get down to the noise and confusion,\n\nThe sound goes round and we start to climb,\nThe lips curl up and it kills my line,\n...\n\n", 
        "Sleepwalk away your life if that turns you on\nIt's only the moment, look away and it's gone\nIt's about time that your mind took a holiday\nYou're all grown up, don't you ever wanna play?\n\nAhh, you've had enough\nOf staring out of deaden eyes\nAhh, it's gonna be tough\nThe battle's on and so is the pride\n\nI don't know what it is I'm feelin'\nA four letter word really get's my meaning\nNothing ever lasts forever\n...\n\n", 
        "I wake up smiling in my little Eden, pay no heed to the world outside\nTake my medication and hide\nWhose been smoking cherry cola, somebody trying to live the dream\nI rattle as I reach to dust the screen\n\nOut the door it might be snowing in my world it's always June\nI don't believe in the world outside my room\nTelevision and dusty windows, fill my head with a happy tune\nI don't believe in the world outside my room\nI don't believe in the world outside my room\n\nLife in here is a different tempo virtually comatosed\n...\n\n", 
        "You didn't know what to say\nBut I'll come at you today\nCan't get out your own way\nWell hold on, hold on, hold on\n\n...\nI'm hiding out in the sun\nI'm getting everyone done\nJust me hitting the wall\n\nHere I come, here I come, here I come\nJust call me the roller\n...\nI'll squeeze and unfold you\n\ncall me the roller\n...\n...\n\n", 
        "The beat breaks down so we pick it up,\nThe floor shakes down but it's not enough,\nThe beam is up and the kids are high,\nI've seen them move and it blows my eyes,\nThe floor's an ocean and this wave is breaking,\nYour head is gone and your body's shaking,\nThere is nothing you can do 'cause there is no solution,\nYou gotta get down to the noise and confusion,\n\nThe sound goes round and we start to climb,\nThe lips curl up and it kills my line,\n...\n\n"
