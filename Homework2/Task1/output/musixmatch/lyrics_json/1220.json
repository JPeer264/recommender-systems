        "Is my world not falling down\nI'm in pieces on the ground\nAnd my eyes aren't open\nAnd I'm standing on my knees\nBut if crying and holding on\nAnd flying on the ground is wrong\nThen I'm sorry to let you down,\nBut you're from my side of town\nAnd I miss you.\n\nTurn me up or turn me down\n...\n\n",

        "Do I have to come right out and say it?\nTell you that you look so fine\nDo I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?\nIf it was a game I could play it\nTrying to make it but I'm losing time\nI got to bring you in, you're overworking my mind\nIndecision is crowding me\nI have no room to spare\nAnd I can't believe she cared\nLike a dream she has taken me\n...\n\n",
