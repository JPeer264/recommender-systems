        "A day made me see all real\nNow I try to keep all clear\nYor're died in your best years\nI don't try to grieve and shed wild tears\nI'll never forget you name\nI try to live on and do - all the things same\n...\n\n", 
        "While ember raised\nHer soul was chased\nBy hate and fear\nBlack friend was near\nA faded flower\nPointed the hour\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm falling, you're calling\nI'm begging you\nI'm walking, you're talking\nI want you\nOut of my mind\nI take some words and keep deep\nYou're crying, you're lying\n...\n\n", 
        "pur your arms around my tights\ncover your hair over my face\nlet me enjoy your lips\nthe glowing haze of lust\nmove your body with the rhythm\nwith the rhythm of passion\nthat allows us to forget\n...\n\n", 
        "in the fog of daybreak\nfar beyond our time\nis your kingdom\noutside of darkness\ngive us vision to see\nyour kingdom\nmake us dream to feel\nyour kingdom\nwhere the wulf lingers by the lamb\nyour kingdom come\nso we are lonely characters\nin the world of darkness\n...\n\n", 
        "Heres to the man who gives to the poor\nWith a hole in his pride you know\nHe only wants to give more\nHeres to the man who feels for the weak\nThe moral of this story is\nYou can never have too much, too late\nPerhaps I need you\nMore than I appreciate you\n\nWe all feel a little danger\nWhen theres something in the air\nWe all feel a little hunger\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been running, trying to be one who sees\nI've been working, salvation out on my knees\nThere is nothing better than knowing\nThat we are redeemed\nUnbelieving trusting in creative hands,\nI am praying for our world to bow to your plan\nAnd this one thought is unmistakable\nI take up my cross and follow you Lord\n...\n\n", 
        "The house lights blaze the spotlights dim and the encore fades away\nWe've got five hundred miles to go and another show to play\nBut there's a few old diehard fans still hanging out back stage\nThey're the ones who have been faithful from the start\nSo we renew our old aquaintances and discuss the life and times\nOf Tommy, Toy and Ronnie and the ones we've left behind\nAnd all the minstrel warriors who got old before their time\nBut they'll always have ap lace here in our hearts\nAnd its time to pick up memories and remember our old freinds\nDo you think we'll ever see the likes of Stevie Ray again\n...\n\n"
