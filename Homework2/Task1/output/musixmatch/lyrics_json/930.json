        "Through windows by my bed\nMiles away i rest my weary head\nNext to you\nNo coldness in my eye\nCut the skin and take my sorry hide\nCover you\nMake love with you\nIt bleeds upon my back\nStrapped with silver tacks\nWish i'd loved you more\nAnd never shut that door\nThe waves that run the shore\nWash away the stones of pain we bore\n...\n\n", 
        "If you're ever unassured\nForever you will burn\nAs you sleep unearthly grace\nLay jesus hands upon your face\nTo this sea you've been shot down\nNow find the shore, it can be found\n...\n\n",
