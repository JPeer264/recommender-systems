        "I bet you're wondering where I've been\nWhat town I'm calling home for now\nAnd just how long I'll be there\nBefore I turn around\n\nTruth is I finally found a place\nWhere I can start to plant some roots\nIts about as close as being perfect\nIt's got everyting but you\n\nTheres a pathway to the ocean\nA salty breeze blowin'\nAnd the old man down the street makes damn good wine\nIts got stars that shine like diamonds\non the black canvas behind them\nAnd there's a sun out here that seems to always shine\n...\n\n",

        "Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night\nThinking, drinking and smoking\nAnd hoping that it's me that's foliating through your mind\nFloating through your mind\n\nThen I get that feeling\nTrying to stop my hands from shaking\nStarring at the ceiling and keeling\nAnd making deals with the man above\nYeah, with the man above\n\nOh, I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight\n\nI wring the sheets out when I'm sweating\nSoaking wet, pacing, chasing the visions\nAnd wishing that I could kiss instead of missing you\n\nOh, I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way?\nLove's in the air tonight\nBet you could make this ol' boy stay\nHey pretty girl, won't you look my way?\n\nHey pretty girl, can I have this dance?\nAnd the next one after that\nGonna make your mind there's a real good chance\nHey pretty girl, can I have this chance?\n\nHey pretty girl, it feels so right\nJust like it's meant to be\nAll wrapped up in my arms so tight\nHey pretty girl, it feels so right\n\n...\n\n",
