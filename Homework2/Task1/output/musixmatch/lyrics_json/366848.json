        "Old as ancient skies\nI've had these wandering eyes\nbut you took me by surprise\nwhen you let me inside of you\n\nInside of you\nInside of you\nThere's got to be\nSome part of me\nInside of you\n\nInside of you, I could cross this desert plane\nInside of you, I can hear you scream my name\nInside of you, while the stars unfold\nI've crossed me heart and I've crossed the world\nAnd I need you here and I need to be\nInside of you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Lately mother earth has been feeling unsatisfied,\nI'd say it's plain from the rain the sweet lady's started to cry,\nFires crackle and blaze in the rays of her burning heart,\nand I don't think it's smart to,\nLay and wait for the day that she dies in our arms.\nWe gotta do something,\nWe gotta do something,\nBefore mother earth gets anymore hurt,\nWe gotta do something!\nFrom what I've read there's a lotta bad stuff in the world today,\nIt's been said it's getting rough to find a place where the children play,\nSo, Mr Prime Minister and Mr President you better see that it's\nnot only me, no, our mob is rising in size,\nand they've been dying to scream out to you!\nYou gotta do something,\nWe gotta do something,\nSometimes I sit in my room and I don't know what to do,\nbut we've gotta do something!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Oh, I'm a love dealer, you wanna score\nI'll give you my number so give me a call\nYou're lookin' so lonely, there's no need to be\nLet me introduce you to my family\n\nMother Mary Marijuana\nUncle Charlie top banana\nMeet my cousin, Crystal Meth\nSister Smack and all the rest\nWoo\n\nJust say yes, just say yes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Another night you're on my mind\nI'm hypnotized but I cannot find the signs\nThe signs for the tube to come home\nI need the tube to get home\nAnother night I'm here alone\nMy eyes so tired from staring at this phone.\n\nWhy won't you call and come home\nPlease call and come home\nAnd I know that you won't come just for the cash\nWill you come for my bangers, my beans and mash.\n\nA suicide in Soho Grand\nMy wrists so tired from working with my hands\nPlease pick me up when I land\nJust be there when I land\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
