        "Tie my hands and torture me\nUntil I find the meaning of my life\nThe light that I see can you take me there\nTo the meaning of my life\n\n1 2 3 4\nThis is how fast time goes by\nI can't seem to find the meaning of my life\n\nHere one day and gone the next\nYou can't afford to live or die tonight\nThe light that I see can you take me there\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't think you ever think about me\nYour cold heart is melting\nSinking through me\nI fall far into your little world\nTo a world I never thought I knew\nWell I can see, just open your eyes girl\nAnd I can see, you're into your own world\nAnd I can see, it's not making any sense\n'Cause you don't see me\n\nYou, don't see me for me\nAll you see is\nI care\nI know you said it\nI won't take that long, you'll see I'm gone\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear the words of a thousand voices sinkin' in my head\nA long time since I've seen you last and you talked to me like this\nI can't remember the last time we talked into forever\nTried too hard\nI've tried so long\n\nHere I am\nWithout a dollar to my name\nWill you take me as I am?\nWell, I'm holding on. (2x)\n\nYeah\n...\n\n", 
        "You took the words right out of my mouth\nDig a hole right through my head\nYou would do anything for me\nYou smacked my face down to the floor\nKicked me screaming you're a whore\nLeft me stripped of my self-esteem\n\nAnd I don't like it\nWhat you made me in\nAnd everything's in black and white\nI still see it\nFrom in your eyes\nI don't like it\nDon't like it\nWhat you made me in\nAnd everything's in black and white\nI still see it\nFrom in your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "Did you hear me calling\nThe day you walked out\nDidn't even turn around\nTo see me trying\nIn this life I'm nothing but alone\nTrying to understand\nThis in front of me\nYou never gave a damn about me\n\nNow, how, how could you just\nTurn your back on me\nNow, after everything I've done for you\nI never walked away from anything but you\nTaking everything from me and turned it\n...\n\n", 
        "Seen your face in the window\nLast night in the rain\nLooks like you had a bad day today\nYou were throwing your things\nAll over the place\nAnd you're burning all the things\nThat you hate\n\nI, I can feel your pain\nThe pain you feel inside\n'Cause I've been there myself\nAnd I, I can feel your pain\nThe pain you feel inside\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm the one that was there for you\nWhen you cut yourself and started to bleed\nAnd I'm the one that you counted on for all the favors you asked of me\nI'm the one that would dry your tears\nEvery time you'd come crying to me\n\nBut ever since the day you blew me off\nEverything you said\nIs a lie, everything is a lie\nDon't you lie to me... \nDon't you lie to me... \n\nSick of the games that you played on me\n...\n\n", 
        "What are these feelings through me?\nHow'd you get these thoughts in my mind?\nEverything that lies around me\nIs a joke for me to criticize\nYou've taken everything from me\nTaken everything that I need\nAnd now that everything's gone\nThere's nothing left for me\n\nCan't you see the ones in need?\nThis isn't over\n\nI'm sick of all this pain\n...\n\n", 
        "And if you ever told me that it would ever be\nAs hard as this\nI think I would have said to go to hell and\nTake it all with you\nNow that I am here\n\nI don't really care about anything that you\nPlay on me\nSo take all your guilt and play with someone\nElse's mind\nI cannot tolerate you\n\nAnd I love to hate you\nAnd I love the way you hate me\nSo take yourself and go\nI cannot take it, I cannot take it\n...\n\n"
