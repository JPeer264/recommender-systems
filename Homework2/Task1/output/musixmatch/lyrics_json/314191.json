        "So we pick, and we scratch, at the scab till it bleeds\nWe always crawl back, till we're on bloody knees\nYou finish what you started, then end up broken hearted\nHere is my confession, I never learn my lesson\nI don't want to talk, I'm sick of always talking\nI tell myself to stop, but I just keep walking\nAnd while I'm at it, It's over and I've had it\nI can't win, when I want what I can't get\n\nAnd I, kissed love goodbye\nYou promised me forever\nWith your lying eyes\n\nWe bring it on, and on ourselves\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
