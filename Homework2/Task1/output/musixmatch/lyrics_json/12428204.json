        "Oh no there she goes, dressed up in Daddy's clothes, quick while he's still away.\nSlip in to his shoes, zip up them denim blues, and let yourself fade away.\nWalk to your front door, meet me by my old house, wait there by the side.\nI think I'm into you, but what am I into, a girl or are you a guy.\nAnd I can't see us walking down the aisle.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Everyone is gonna run away, today.\nIt's not cause what you do or what you say,\nIt's just time to get leaving now.\n\nNobody has ever seen his face, but fear his smile.\nI heard he'll drink your blood just for the taste, then laugh, and spit it out.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
