        "Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl\nGot my striped tie, got my hopes high\nGot the time and the place and I got the rhythm,\nNow all I need's the girl to go with 'em\n\nIf she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl\nAnd if she'll say \"My, darling, I'm yours\"\n...\n\n", 
        "The moon was yellow and the night was young\nA smile brought us together, and I was wond'ring whether\nWe'd meet again some day\nThe moon was yellow and the song was sung\nThat vocal inspiration gave me the inclination\nTo give my heart away\n...\n\n", 
        "I cover the waterfront,\nI'm watching the sea,,\nWill the one I love,\nBe coming back to me?\n\nI cover the waterfront,\nIn search of my love,\nAnd I'm covered by,\n...\n\n", 
        "Just friends, lovers no more\nJust friends, but not like before\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places\nThat this heart of mine embraces all day through\nIn that small cafe, the park across the way\nThe children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well\nI'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I get no kick from champagne\nMere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all\nSo tell me why should it be true?\nThat I get a kick out of you\n\nSome dig that perfume from Spain\nI'm sure that if I took even one whiff\nIt would bore me terrifically too\nBut I get a kick out of you\n\nI get a kick every time I see you\n...\n\n", 
        "Seems that I read, or somebody said\nThat out of sight is out of mind\nMaybe that's so but I tried to go\nAnd leave you behind, what did I find\n\nI took a trip on the train\nAnd I thought about you,\nI passed a shadowy lane\n...\n\n", 
        "She just got here yesterday,\nThings are hot here now they say\nThere's a new gal in town\nGals are jealous, there's no doubt\n\nAll the guys just rave about\nSweet, sweet Georgia Brown\nAnd ever since she came\nThe common folks all claim, say\n\nNo gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown\nTwo left feet, but oh, so neat has sweet Georgia Brown\nThey all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown\n...\n\n", 
        "Some folks were meant to live in clover\nBut they are such a chosen few, chosen few\nAnd clover being green\nIs something I've never seen\nCause I was born to be blue\n\nWhen there's a yellow moon above me\nThey say there's moonbeams I should view, I should view\nBut moonbeams being gold\nAre something I can't behold\nCause I was born to be blue\n\n...\n\n", 
        "And now the purple dusk of twilight time\nSteals across the meadows of my heart\nHigh up in the sky the little stars climb\nAlways reminding me that we're apart\nYou wander down the lane and far away\nLeaving me a song that will not die\nLove is now the stardust of yesterday\nThe music of the years gone by.\n\nSometimes I wonder, how I spend\n...\n\n", 
        "Stay as sweet as you are\nDon't let a thing\nEver change you\nStay as sweet as you are\nDon't let a soul\nRearrange you\n\nDon't ever lose\nThe charm you possess\nYour loveliness, darling\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "Every kiss, every hug seems to act just like a drug\nYou're getting to be a habit with me\nLet me stay in your arms I'm addicted to your charms\nYou're getting to be a habit with me\n\nI used to think your love was something\nThat I could take or leave alone\n...\n\n", 
        "The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly\nThe trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly\nThen you and I came wandering by\n...\n\n", 
        "The old master painter from the faraway hills\nPainted the violets and the daffodils\nHe put the purple in the twilight haze\nThen did a rainbow for the rainy days\nDreamed up the murals on the blue summer skies\nPainted the devil in my darling's eyes\nCaptured the dreamer with a thousand thrills\nThe old master painter from the faraway hills\nThen came his masterpiece and when he was through\nHe smiled down from heaven and he gave me you\n...\n\n",
