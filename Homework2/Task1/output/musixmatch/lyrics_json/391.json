        "I like walking in the park\nWhen it gets late at night\nI move round in the dark\nAnd leave when it gets light\nI sit around by day\nTied up in chains so tight\nThese crazy words of mine\nSo wrong they could be right\nWhat do I get out of this\nI always try, I always miss\nOne of these days you'll go back to your home\nYou won't even notice that you are alone\nOne of these days when you sit by yourself\nYou'll realise you can't shaft without someone else\nIn the end you will submit\nIt's got to hurt you a little bit\nI like talking in my sleep\n...\n\n",

        "Help me, somebody, help me\nI wonder where I am\nI see my future before me\nI'll hurt you when I can\n\nIt seems like I've been here before\nIt seems like I've been here before\n...\n\n", 
        "I see danger, danger, danger\nOn the corner sent by me\nShadows the ways\nStraight away you ran from me\nHeard you calling\nYes I heard you calling\nHeard you calling\nYes I heard you calling\nI hear silence\nI hear silence in my heart\nFrom a distance\nTurn your back and run from me\nHeard you calling\nYes I heard you calling\n...\n\n",
