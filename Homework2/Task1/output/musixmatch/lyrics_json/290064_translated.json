        "Sun been down for days\nA pretty flower in a vase\nA slipper by the fireplace\nA cello lying in its case\n\nSoon she's down the stairs\nHer morning elegance she wears\nThe sound of water makes her dream\nAwoken by a cloud of steam\nShe pours a daydream in a cup\nA spoon of sugar sweetens up\n\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she puts on her coat\nAnd she fights for her life on the train\nShe looks at the rain as it pours\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she goes in a store\nWith a thought she has caught by a thread\n...\n\n", 
        "Look at the sky\nIt belonged to a guy\nThat I know\nAnd I thought I forgot\nLong ago\n\nLook at the trees\nDidn\u2019t stop at the top\nNot for him\nUsed to borrow the wind\nFor a walk\n\n...\n\n", 
        "On the opposite side of the sea\nThe opposite side of the day\nThe colors are brighter and glee\nThe people unusually gray\n\nOn the opposite side of the sun\nThe ground is too hot to stand on\nToo hot to stand on so they run\n\nOn the opposite side of the waves\nThe edge of a town to be saved\nAnd quiet by night it\u2019ll keep\nFor those who still dream there\u2019s no sleep\n...\n\n", 
        "Locked in a room with a sink and a broom\nAnd the walls are all white\nBut you think it's alright\n'Cause a wonderful picture of a bridge\nWhich is covered in frost\nAnd a man comes a cross\n\nLocked in a room that is nothing but walls\nAnd you search for a chair\nBut there's nothing at all\nAnd the one thing you find when you look at the floor\nIs a key, but there isn't a door\n\nNow that you're locked in a room\nThere is room to assume\nYou are there for a cause\nYou're not sure what it was\nWhen you're locked in a room\n\nLocked within a room of memory\n...\n\n", 
        "Ruby rises at dawn\nWith a sigh and a yawn\nAnd a dream lingers on\nIn her dream she\u2019s a swan\n\nWith a cloud over head\nRuby swims out of bed\nShe removes from her hair\nMonsters made out of air\n...\n\n", 
        "the road stretches on from unknown destination\nacross open streams\nthrough fields of carnations\nit enters a city, a building\nit stretches ahead\nit stops at the feet\nthe feet of his bed\n\nhe's aware of a small inclination\na dream in a dream\nhe pays no attention\noranges hover and faces all over he knows\nis how the dream goes\n...\n\n",
