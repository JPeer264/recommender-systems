        "Taking down your neighbour won't take you any higher\nI burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire\nI've never gotten taller making someone else feel small\nIf you ain't got nothing nice to say don't say nothing at all\n\nJust hoe your own row and raise your own babies\nSmoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies\nMend your own fences and own your own crazy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Sometimes good intentions\nDon't come across so well\nGot me analyzing everything that ain't worth thinking bout\n\nJust 'cause I ain't lived through\nThe same hand that was dealt to you\nDoesn't make me any less or make any more of you\n\nI wouldn't trade my best day\nSo you could validate\nAll your fears\nAnd if I've only got one shot\nWon't waste it on a shadow boxI'll stand right here\n\n'Cause it's all talk talk talkTalking in the windIt only slows you down when you start listening\nAnd it's a whole lot harder to shine\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "\"Rainbow\"\n\nWhen it rain it pours but you didn't even notice\nIt ain't rainin' anymore, It's hard to breathe when all we know is\nThe struggle of staying above, the rising water line\n\nThe sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowin'\nBut you're stuck out in the same old storm again\nHold tight to your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "The news is out all over town\nThat you've been seen out runnin' around\nI know that I should leave but then\nI just can't go you win again\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
