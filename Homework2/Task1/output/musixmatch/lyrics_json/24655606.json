        "I heard you crying loud\nAll the way across town\nYou've been searching for that someone\nAnd it's me out on the prowl\nAs you sit around feeling\nSorry for yourself\nWell, don't get lonely now\nAnd dry your whining eyes\nI'm just roaming for the moment\nSleazin' my back yard, so don't get so uptight\nYou've been thinking about ditching me\nNo time to search the world around'\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Sometimes I feel I've got to\nRun away I've got to\nGet away\nFrom the pain that you drive into the heart of me\nThe love we share\nSeems to go nowhere\nAnd I've lost my light\nFor I toss and turn I can't sleep at night\nOnce I ran to you (I ran)\nNow I'll run from you\nThis tainted love you've given\nI give you all a boy could give you\nTake my tears and that's not nearly all\nOh, tainted love\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
