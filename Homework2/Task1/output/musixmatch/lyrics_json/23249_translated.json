        "You may have the money\nBut you've got to go\nIt's sensible\nIt's sensible\nAnd those endless seasons\nThat go on and on\nIncredible\n\nBut I'd sooner get out\nAnd remember where we went last year\nYou said everything about it moved on your career\nIf you want to go\nI'll take you back one day\n\nBecause this isn't Paris\nAnd this isn't London\n...\n\n"
