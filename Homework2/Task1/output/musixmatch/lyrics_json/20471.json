        "Young girl, don't cry\nI'll be right here when your world starts to fall\nOoh\nYoung girl, it's alright\nYour tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly, ooh\n\nWhen you're safe inside your room, you tend to dream\nOf a place where nothing's harder than it seems\nNo one ever wants or bothers to explain\nOf the heartache life can bring and what it means\n\nWhen there's no one else, look inside yourself\nLike your oldest friend, just trust the voice within\nThen you'll find the strength that will guide your way\nYou'll learn to begin to trust the voice within, oh\n\nYoung girl, don't hide\nYou'll never change if you just run away\nOoh, whoa yeah\nYoung girl, just hold tight\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
