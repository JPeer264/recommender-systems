        "Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\nBut I'm only going to get this one chance\n(Six minutes, six minutes)\nSomething's wrong, I can feel it\n(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)\nJust a feeling I've got\nLike something's about to happen\nBut I don't know what\nIf that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble\nBig trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say\nI'm not taking any chances\nYou were just what the doctor ordered\n\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot\n\nBut for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a living and a killing off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)\nThis flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissing match\nWith this rappity-rap\nPacking a mack in the back of the Ac\nbackpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nand at the exact same time\nI attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that\nI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic\nI was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow? All I do is drop \"F\" bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are having a rough time period\nHere's a Maxi-Pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad\nFor the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah\n\n'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard\n\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap\nImmortality like I have got\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the earth like an asteroid\nand did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)\nMC's get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'\nNow I lead a New School full of students\nMe? Me, I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up\nBlow up and being in a position\nTo meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock n'\nRoll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church\nAnd burst in a ball of flames\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
