        "Is this as good as it gets,\nI feel like I just ain't seen nothing yet,\nRegret is just another word for time ill spent\nAnd guilt the only consequence\nA continent of scenery is seperating you from me\n\nAnd I don't suppose you'd leave it all behind\nAnd I don't suppose you'd leave it I'll be...\n\nHalf awake, I'm half undone\nI've half a mind get up and run\nto the other side of America\nHalf a buck, stick out my thumb\nA stroke of luck will have me come\nto the other side of America\n...\n\n"
