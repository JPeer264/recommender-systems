        "Please heal me, feel me, kill me... \nIt's not easy.\nEverything I had is what I had to give, \nAnd what I have is not enough for me to live.\n\nSuffer! \n\nSomedays I cannot cope at all.\nDo I have to get on my knees and crawl?\nWho's to blame?\nIs it my... fault?\n\nIs this what my life does?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "There's nothing that you can take from me\nThat you don't have to a certain degree\nGod help me feel something, because I feel nothing\nWhat do you want from me? I have given you my plea\nGave you my life, gave you my soul in which you already control\nWhat do you want from me? Give me time to grieve\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I hide emotions so well,\nI guess that you can never tell.\nI hide emotions so well, i guess you can ever tell\nHold my tears inside\nHurting so so bad i wishes id just die\nThis is an informal disguise you all fail to recognize\nBehind my razor blade smile\nYEAH!\nNO MORE DEPRESSION!\nNO MORE SUPPRESSION!\nThese are the things you dont know\nBecause i chose not to show\nHiding my anger my pain through expressions i cant explain\nYou gotta love my technique, so beautifully unique.\nI expose the weak, you abash me the meek.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
