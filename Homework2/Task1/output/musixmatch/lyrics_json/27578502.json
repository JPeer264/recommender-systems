        "While you count my mistakes\nTally like a score\nBut like a circle in a square\nThe edges to ignore\n\nAnd I've done all I can\nBut I knew I could do more\nBut I swear I'll try this time\nLike so many time before\n\nYou see these walls are caving in\nAs the ceiling's sinking low\nThough I said I'll try this time\nI've got nothing left to show\n...\n\n",

        "I shoot down the stars\nCollect them in jars\nI shoot for the moon\nI won't be home soon\n\nThere's monsters at home\nI feel so alone\nI'm lost out in space\nWhile standing in place\n\nThere grass here won't grow\nThe colors won't flow\nThere's something creeping\n...\n\n",
