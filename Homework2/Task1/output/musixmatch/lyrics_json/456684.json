        "I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles\nAnd the heavens open every time she smiles\nAnd when I come to her that's where I belong\nYet I'm running to her like a river's song\n\nShe give me love, love, love, love, crazy love\nShe give me love, love, love, love, crazy love\n\nShe's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "The days were long and the nights so cold\nThe pages turn and the tale unfolds\nHe left me for another lady\nShe stood so tall and she never slept\nThe was not one moment he could regret\nHe left me for another lady\n\nHe took my hand one day and told me\nHe was leaving\nMe disbelieving\nAnd I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I\nHad to let him go\n\nHer name was New York, New York\nAnd she took his heart away oh my\nHer name was New York, New York\nShe had poisoned his sweet mind\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "New lover started getting closer\nmy mind went on a rollercoaster\nWe could talk, we could laugh\nAnd he charmed, my breath away\n\nNew lover made me downright restless\nMove too fast and I'd end up vestless\nWe'd be rude, and be crude\nAnd he charmed, my breath away\n\nOh\n\nAnd then he turned around and said \\\"I Luv Ya\\\"\nNot \\\"I love you\\\" but \\\"I Luv Ya\\\"\nThat's no good\nWhat am I s'posed to think about that\nWhen it feels so good but you're holding back\nWhat am I s'posed to respond that\nBetter off in silence than to speak such crap\n\nNot so new lover had become so tasteless\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I'll be the late night lady you won't recognise\nI'm a chameleon I'm always in disguise\nI'd read your future but it's written in the past\nTake a good look might be your last\n\nDon't try to show me, cause you don't know me\nStay away\n\nI can be wilder than the wind\n119 miles an hour\nI'm in a whole other dimension\nDancing doubles on the floor\nYou think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy\nBut I'm stone cold sober\n\nYou're telling me something\nBut there's nothing cheap as words\nI'm walking away before I do affect the birds\nExcuse me Mr I've got other things to do\nThan to stand here listening to you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
