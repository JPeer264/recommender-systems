        "Cold and misty morning, I heard a warning borne in the air\nAbout an age of power where no one had an hour to spare,\nWhere the seeds have withered, silent children shivered, in the cold\nNow their faces captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold.\nI'll be there\nI'll be there\nI will be there.\n\nSuffering in silence, they've all been betrayed.\nThey hurt them and they beat them, in a terrible way.\nPraying for survival at the end of the day.\nThere is no compassion for those who stay.\nI'll be there\nI'll be there\nI will be there\n\nThere must be someone who can set them free:\nTo take their sorrow from this odyssey\nTo help the helpless and the refugee\nTo protect what's left of humanity.\nCan't you see\nCan't you see\nCan't you see\n\nI'll be there\nI'll be there\nI will be there;\n\nTo heal their sorrow\nTo beg and borrow\nFight tomorrow.\n\nStep inside! Hello! We've a most amazing show\nYou'll enjoy it all we know\nStep inside! Step inside!\n\nWe've got thrills and shocks, supersonic fighting cocks.\nLeave your hammers at the box\nCome inside! Come inside!\n\nRoll up! Roll up! Roll up!\nSee the show!\n\nLeft behind the bars, rows of Bishops' heads in jars\nAnd a bomb inside a car\nSpectacular! Spectacular!\n\nIf you follow me there's a speciality\nSome tears for you to see\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
