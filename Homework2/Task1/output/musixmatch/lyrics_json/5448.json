        "There are things that used to make me smile\nOne of them was you for just a little while\nYou left me for dead so far away\nI replaced you with fear and shame\nYou'll be happy on the day I die\n\nThere are things that used to make me laugh\nBut now they're deeply buried in the past\nI left them there so far away\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm alone\nSitting with my empty glass\nMy four walls\nFollow me through my past\nI was on a Paris train\nI emerged in London rain\nAnd you were waiting there\nSwimming through apologies\n\nI remember searching for the perfect words\nI was hoping you might change your mind\nI remember a soldier sleeping next to me\nRiding on the metro\n\nYou wore white\nSmiling as you took my hand\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, I'll sit here to convince myself its true\nIf you keep on telling your friends that we're through\n\nI've got nothing here but loneliness\nHoles in walls and bleeding fists\nMy head is pounding like a pillow\nLike a big black song\n\nMy friends and I try to tell me you're gone\nWon't listen to myself or anyone\n\nYou got on a plane and off you went\n...\n\n", 
        "Sit down and please make yourself comfortable\nI might need some time\nTo dance around what I need to say\nI love you to death, I think I need a break\n\nI spend my days worried out loud\nI gag in my head, I choke it back down\nIt hurts me inside to save you inside\nSo close my lips tight, move eyes to the side\n\nThis is the way we disappear\n...\n\n", 
        "A deep dark secret down at the bottom\nBut this bay can't keep it unforgotten\nAnd a story that was told has now grown taller than we'd ever wish to be\nBeyond belief\n\nI'll grab the boat if you go grab the anchor\nThe tarp and twine and the weights that sank her\nThey weren't enough, look who showed up\n...\n\n", 
        "You're on your own my little nightmare you cannot stay here\nIt's far too bright for you\nIf they attack you just lay there\nPlay dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through.\n\nAnd seconds they seem like a lifetime.\nA dream, recurring, a dream that can't come true.\nAnd they'll pin it all on you\nafter all you've been put through.\n\n\"Sadie G. she's crazy, see?\"\nThat's what the white coats say.\nNow Ms. Susan A. you're losing\nevery opportunity to put us all away.\n...\n\n", 
        "There are things that used to make me smile\nOne of them was you for just a little while\nYou left me for dead so far away\nI replaced you with fear and shame\nYou'll be happy on the day I die\n\nThere are things that used to make me laugh\nBut now they're deeply buried in the past\nI left them there so far away\n...\n\n", 
        "do you remember the story of the boy and his first date?\nshe took him to the lake and he fell in love.\nshe spent one summer waking up between his arms.\nshe told him how good that felt, told him he was the one.\nand then she went away, his calls were not returned.\nhe went to see her, but her eyes were burning a different stare.\nthe focus was somewhere else.\n...\n\n", 
        "Soon ends our stay here and it's been fun.\nSo tonight I'll raise my glass to us.\n'Cause we've talked so much I think we filled this ashtray twice,\nAnd I'm pretty sure we emptied every bottle in the place...\n\nSo let's walk home, let's be afraid.\nI wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you so hard.\nLet's do it right, under the streetlight.\nI want it now, somehow I forgot how.\n\nWay to go, way to go.\nForgot you've got so far to go.\n...\n\n"
