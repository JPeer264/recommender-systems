        "Boy I see you lookin' over\nYou keep on looking back at what you knew\nWhen will you come closer\n\nCloser to the one that's good for you\nCause you're still goin' back to that life\nAnd I refuse to stand on the side\n\nBy sparing her from heartache\nDon't you know you end up hurting me\n\nI see your head spinning right around\nShe makes you fall hard and hit the ground\n\nWhen you ever gonna let her go\nI see the way that she breaks you so\nAll I'm asking is for you please\nTo take control and be set free\n\nMake the space so we can grow\nSave us before I let you go\nSo you say this will get better\nBetter for you, her, or me?\nWell I don't know what to tell ya\n\nIt's not my fault that I don't believe\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing\nJust prayed to a god that I don't believe in\nCause I got time while he got freedom\nCause when a heart breaks no it don't break even\nHis best days will be some of my worst\nHe finally met a girl that's gonna put him first\nWhile I'm wide awake he's not trouble sleeping\nCause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even no.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?\nWhat am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?\nI'm falling to pieces\nI'm falling to pieces\n\nThey say bad things happen for a reason\nBut no wise words gonna stop the bleeding\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
