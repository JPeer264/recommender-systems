        "Silent love is calling faith\nTo shatter me through your hallways\nInto echoes you can feel\nAnd rehearse the way you heal\n\nMake them dance\nJust like you\n'Cause you make me move\nYeah you always make go\n\nI'll run away with your foot steps\nI'll build a city that dreams for two\nAnd if you lose yourself\nI will find you\n\nHigh on words\nWe almost used\nWe're fireworks with a wet fuse\nFlying planes with paper wheels\nTo the same Achilles heels\n\nMake them dance\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
