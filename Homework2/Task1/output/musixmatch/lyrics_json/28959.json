        "I can do the somber\nLike in November\nThen rock a crowd while I'm in my pajamas\nLike Tito Puente\nI am muy caliente\nFuck Kunta Kinte\nCuz Son is the sensei\nI funk with the black belt\nYou better step back hell\nI can Get Smart\nJust like Agent Maxwell\nI don't give a fuck G\nHey hey we're the Monkees\nI'll rock a rhyme to the end of the month see\nI go on and on\nLike a marathon\nI sing like Sarah Vaughn\nBut like the underground\nI flip through some kung-fu\nYou know that I've come to\nFreak the ill shit\nYou just can't undo\nChorus:\nSon, get it funky (I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em) (4x)\nSon, get it funky (yo, I'm shittin' on 'em)\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
