What have we chosen to be?\nNow, all history is reduced to the syllables of our name -\nnothing can ever be the same now the Immortals are here.\nAt the time, it seemed a reasonable course\nto harness all the force of life without the threat of death,\nbut soon we found\nthat boredom and inertia are not negative,\nbut all the law we know\nand dead are Will and words like survival.\n\nArrival at immunity from all age, all fear and all end...\nWhy do I pretend?
