        "Runaway\nAs I walk along, I wonder\nA what went wrong whit our love\nA love that was so strong\n\nAnd as I still walk on\nI think of the thing's we've done\nTogether, while our hearts were young\n\nI'm a walkin' in the rain\nTears are fallin' and I feel a pain\nA wishin' you were here by me\nTo end this misery\n...\n\n", 
        "Aaron Neville\nMiscellaneous\nMy Heart, My Soul\nif you were a road, i'd learn every turn,\ntill i could find my way with my eyes close\nif you were a song i'd sing along,\ntill i know every word and every note\n\nbut you are everthing to me,\na mystery, your the love i live to see\n\nCHORUS\n...\n\n"
