        "They call it magic, they call it tragic,\nbut they don't know this thing we got\nWe're in the fast lane a runaway train,\nAnd we never gonna stop\nand we run like the wolves run like the wolves run like the wolves\nBut it's the only thing we've got\n\nI've been thinkin' bout you\nGot a hold on me\nYeah\nI'm just tryna break thru\nAll these people round me\nTryna set me free,\nbut Lord knows I will follow you\nInto the Fire\nInto the Fire\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
