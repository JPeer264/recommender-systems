        "I once had a friend\nThey found him in a car\nA hose to the window\nAnd the motor running hot\nSeems he couldn't take it\nThe rhetoric of life\n\nSomeone found him naked\nWith a note right by his side\nBy his side, oh by his side\nHe can't take it back\n\nNeither can I\nNo, neither can I\nMommy and Daddy\nI've borrowed the car\nTo sleep on the floor\nI'm sorry so much\nFor bringing my own\nLiving hell to your door\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Ain't it scary deep inside?\nAren't you naked with no pride?\nLet me turn you on\nOh, I can feed you lies\nLet me turn you on\n\nIt's no longer a game\nAnd under your skin\nI'm ready to dive in\nParasites on television screens\nHide in the cracks and\n...\n\n", 
        "Sour, this affliction\nIf it was me I'd have it fixed\nAnd with everywhere you've been\nYou're much too old to be so naive\n\nSo what the hell do you want to be?\nFollowing the trends that never end\nI can't stand the parties you attend\nSo what the hell do you want with me?\n\nOh, you're so underground, oh, ain't that swell\nWell the word is on the street\nYou're collecting sympathy\nAnd then you hide\n\nAnd ya ain't been out in days\nWill the sunshine burn your face?\nPreserve your precious skin\nI'll go out, you stay in\n...\n\n", 
        "Skinny kid flippin' out\nA prissy little thing with a tan\nWas an outcast in the basement\nTryin' anything he can\nThe skirts spit words like razor blades\nTo keep him off their trail\nHe keeps a chant of silence\nFor a mom\n\nThe dirty rats is sellin' things\nHe can't afford\nHe leaves his misery to play\nIn the Soma City Ward\nSome City Ward\n...\n\n", 
        "Lower than the bottom\nSwallowed by the ride\nFloating in the bathtub\nChildren play outside\n\nSo tell me how to do it\nHow to do what I'm gonna do\nHow to take the knife\nFrom inside of you\nBaby, now you're lower too\n\nYou looked so unhappy\nSquatting in some stall\nAnd it gets even better\nWhen all the lights are off\n...\n\n", 
        "It's been a long year\nSince you've been gone\nI've been alone here\nI've grown old\nFall to pieces, I'm falling\nFell to pieces and I'm still falling\n\nEvery time I'm falling down\nAll alone I fall to pieces\n\nI keep a journal of memories\nI'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe\nFall to pieces, I'm falling\nFell to pieces and I'm still falling\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Mother told me, yes, she told me I'd meet girls like you.\nShe also told me, \"Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch.\"\nJust the other day I heard a of a soldier's falling off.\nSome Indonesian junk that's going round.\n\nChorus) Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird.\nSurrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay.\n\nFather says, \"Your mother's right, she's really up on things.\"\n...\n\n"
