        "Does not Exist, Take an Exit\nI hear voices insinuating\nFeeds me words to this song that I am saying\n...\n\n", 
        "We're goin' down the road towards tiny cities made of ashes\nGonna hit you on the face gonna punch you in your\nglasses. Oh no!\nJust got a message said \"Yeah hell is freezin' over\"\nI Got a phone call from the Lord sayin' \"boy go get a\nsweater. Right now\"\nSo we're drinkin' drinkin' drinkin' drinkin' coca-coca-cola\nI can feel it rollin' right on down\nRight on down my throat\nAs we're headed down the road towards tiny cities\nmade of ashes\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm the same as I was when I was 6 years old\nAnd oh, my God, I feel so old\nI don't really feel anything\nOn a plane, I can see the tiny lights below\nAnd oh, my God, they look so alone\nNow, do they really feel anything?\nOh, my God, I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta move on\nWhere do you move when what you're moving from\nIs yourself?\n\nThe universe works on a math equation\nThat never, ever, ever really ends\nInfinity spirals out creation on the tip of its tongue\nAnd it is saying\n\"We ain't sure where you stand\n...\n\n", 
        "Won herself a pass to some far off moon\nIt was second class but what's to lose\nAnd looking out her window she could more than assume\nThat you can't see air or time\nShe's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place\nThey gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face\nShe still got plenty lonely but that's just the case\nWith time, time, time\nStarted hearing voices sometime in June\n...\n\n", 
        "Traveling swallowing Dramamine\nFeeling spaced breathing out Listerine\nI'd said what I'd said that I'd tell ya\nAnd that you'd killed the better part of me\nIf you could just milk it for everything\n...\n\n", 
        "Jesus Christ was an only child\nWent down to the river\nAnd he drank and smiled\nAnd his dad was oh-so-mad\nShould have insured that planet\nBefore it crashed\nWorking hard to make internet cash\n...\n\n", 
        "You're in the back seat and you say to yourself\n\"it doesn't matter anyway\"\nWeeds pulling weeds and your Blaming yourself\nWe're all indifferent in our own ways\nYou're in trouble now and you say to yourself\n...\n\n", 
        "You're standing by the grey ice water\nOut in the wind above ground out in the weather\nYou had yourself a crazy lover\nBecoming frozen trying hard to forget her\nYou got a job up in alaska\nTo save what the cannery pays\nThere ain't no way to spend it\n...\n\n", 
        "Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot\nWaiting to bleed on the big streets\nThat bleed out on the highways and\nOff to others cities built to store and\nSell these rocks\nWell aren't you feeling real dirty\n...\n\n", 
        "Going to Colorado\nTo unload my head\nGoing to New York City\nThat's in New York, friends\nI'm going to Arizona\nSex on the rocks all warm and red\nAnd we all bled\n\nGoing up to Alaska\nGonna get off scot-fucking-free\nAnd we all did\n\nThis truckers atlas roads the ways\nThe freeways and highways don't know\nThe buzz from the bird on the dash\nRoad locomotive phone\n...\n\n",
