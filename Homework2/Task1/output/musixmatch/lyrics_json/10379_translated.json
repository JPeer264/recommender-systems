        "I am the doctor\nwith the condition\nI am the patient\nand the physician\nI give myself the scalpel\nand make the first incision\nI look inside the cut\nand make the last decision\n...\n\n", 
        "Sisters of Mercy-\nI'm afraid we're gonna have to go over your head.\nCheap plastics, elastics;\nWe smoke at least a pack a day.\n\nEvery song is a Schweppes commercial;\nAll the kids charge over the hill.\nI take my parents for granted.\nI fear I've had my fill.\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got a feeling,\nThat special feeling.\nI've got no feeling,\nThat so so feeling.\n\nNoble monsters turn to parakeets and pigeons.\nTyrannosaurus Rex turns into a chicken.\nThey shrink back down to size,\n...\n\n", 
        "Where is all the love?\nIt's been washed out by the flood.\nAll the kids wear street clothes\nOn the first Monday of the month.\nAnd the principal will moan\nWhen she sees how much I've grown.\nAfter 7 years\nThey stamp our ears\nAnd send us on our own.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "sad story, second chapter\nwhere the miser lost it all\ndressed in rags, color purple\nbig man took a great big fall\nfor what\n\nskips work and gets fired\ngot sort of back to where he was before\nred faced and red handed\nhe got caught when he went for more\nyou scratched that\nnow you'll have to put it back\nhang up fast\n...\n\n",

        "He's a bad mother fucker,\n16 pairs of shoes\nIn a closet 6 feet deep,\nAnd 6 feet wide and 6 feet high.\n\nBlackouts on Thursday!\nTotal Blackouts are where it's at.\nI'm going back to high school\nWhere I can make out like a cat.\n\nIt's a shake down.\nA mental breakdown,\n...\n\n", 
        "False starts overlooked;\nI don't mind until the finish line.\nThis Saint Sebastian's blushing bride,\nHer eyes are closed but her mouth is opened wide.\n\nSynapses explode but we still miss the mother lode.\nDon't go to school.\n...\n\n", 
        "Rally up my friends,\nCome and stand by my bedside.\nIf I die tonight\nPut my head inside a masons jar.\nPut it in the ocean\nAnd send it out to sea,\nI'm wading because-\n\nAnd when I hit some shore,\nAnd when my seal is broke,\nI'll split my eyes and lips asking,\n\"Is this a judgement or a joke?\"\n\nThis is a chance to make it up.\nThis is a chance to dissect it.\nThis is a chance to break it up.\n...\n\n"
