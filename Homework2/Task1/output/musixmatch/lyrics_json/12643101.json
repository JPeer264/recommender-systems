        "Standing in a line\nWonder why it don't move\nTryna get air\nWatching people break the rules\nMaybe the man in charge, doesn't like my face\nBut then this world's not always good\n\nAnd nothing's real but love\nNothing's real but love\nNo money, no house, no car, can be the love\n\nThe roar just opened light\nAs it don't grand like blues\nSee who can be the waste\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "How good or bad, happy or sad does it have to get\nLosing yourself, don't cry for help\nYou don't think you need it and old friends are just a chore\nBut now you need 'em more than ever before\n\nAll that glitter and all that gold, won't buy you happy\nWhen you've been bored and sore, right in one\nYou can't control with all your glitter and all of your gold\nTake care of your soul, take care of your soul, soul, soul, soul\n\nHow high, how low, how on your own does it have to get?\nLosing your soul will cost you more and that life you're paying for\nAnd all those friends that are just a chore\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Cos I feel safe when your near me\nAnd I can hold you completely\nThough you constantly hurt me\n\nAnd we fight\nAnd we cry\nAnd we tell the same lies about Love\nAnd we cling to each other shoulder to shoulder against the world\n\nSo I'm gonna drag you down\nwhilst you drag me down\nAnd I'm gonna shout at you\nwhilst you shout at me until we realise that real love is free free\n\nAnd I get a kick when you worry\nThat you are just no good for me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Okay, so I call about a thousand times\nI wait outside and I join the line\nWith a million girls that are just like me, ooh\n\nI got your name saved on my screen\nIt says how much that you love me\nAnd I know that it's not a dream\n\nOh, yeah\n\nIt's like I keep on giving with nothing in return\nJust a constant burning, I'll never learn\nSo let me just fairytale that we are in love\nI'd rather live a life this way, oh, yeah\nIt's my life anyway\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Second guessing, never learn my lessons,\nAlways chasing after, what somebody else had stole,\nWhen you took your chances, I wasn't burnt to ashes,\nAnd your broken promises have left you out in the cold,\nWith each lie that you told, lie that you told,\n\nI learn a little more, learn a little more,\nAnd it was brighter before, brighter,\nYour love don't shine anymore,\nYou went and turned a diamond to a stone,\nI should have known to leave you well alone,\nInstead I chose to lay you in my heart,\nMy eyes don't shine quite like they did before\nLike a diamond to a stone.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
