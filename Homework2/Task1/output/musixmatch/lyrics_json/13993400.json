        "Up in the San Francisco where the forest meets the bridge\nI thought I saw you standing there and them you fell onto the rails\nBut that was many years ago and I am so much older now\nMy brother is a soldier now\nI can't see the many how, I moved up in the wind\nAnd you swimming up tide or just to the hand radio stations\n\nI left my love in San Francisco\nThat's okay, I was bored anyway\nI left my love in the room\nThat's okay, I was born in L.A.\n\nI left my love in San Francisco\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "See him sitting with his carburetor blues\nReading newspapers that don't report the news\nGoes to work\nHis boss' a jerk, yeah you know\nOn his walk he smoke three cigarettes, in a row\nBy the time he arrives at the office he's got nowhere else to go\n\nNo matter what I say or do I'll always be in love with you\n\nReading silently in bed beside his wife\nWonders why they haven't talked in half their lives\nBut he knows\nThat she'll say:\n\"You never even loved me, anyway\"\nHe's so tired that by the evening he's got nothing left to say\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
