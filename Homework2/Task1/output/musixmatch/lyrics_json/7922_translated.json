        "Wake up, my love, beneath the midday sun,\nAlone, once more alone,\nThis travelin' boy was only passing through,\nBut he will always think of you.\n\nOne night of love beside a strange young smile,\nAs warm as I have known,\nA travelin' boy and only passing through,\nBut one who'll always think of you.\n...\n\n", 
        "Down in the willow garden\nWhere me and my love did meet,\nAs we set there a courtin',\nMy love fell off to sleep.\n\nI had a bottle of burgundy wine,\nMy love she did not know.\nSo I poisoned that dear little girl\nOn the banks below.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Everyone has gone away,\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me?\nNo one cared enough to stay,\nCan you hear me?\n\nYou must remember me, old man,\nI know that you can if you try,\nSo just open up your eyes, old man,\nLook who's come to say, good-bye.\n...\n\n", 
        "I bruise you\nYou bruise me\nWe both bruise too easily\nToo easily to let it show\nI love you and that's all I know\n\nAll my plans\nHave fallen through\nAll my plans depend on you\nDepend on you to help them grow\nI love you and that's all I know\n...\n\n", 
        "Mary was an only child,\nNobody held her, nobody smiled.\nShe was born in a trailer, wretched and poor,\nAnd she shone like a gem in a five and dime store.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We are going, heaven knows where we are going,\nWe'll know we're there.\nWe will get there, heaven knows how we will get there,\nWe know we will.\n...\n\n", 
        "Close your eyes, my pretty child\nThough the night is dark and the wind is wild\nI will stand beside your bed\nTonight there is nothing you need fear or dread\n\nYou can sleep now, go to sleep\nThe rain falls and the windows weep\nI'm standing by to sing a lullaby\n\n...\n\n",

        "I shall sing\nsing my song\nBe it right\nbe it wrong\nIn the night\nin the day\nAnyhow\nanyway.\nI shall sing\n\nLa-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La\nLa-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La\nLa-La-La...\n\n...\n\n",

        "She walks in the field that's just across the way\nAnd picks all the flowers that brighten up a day.\nAnd the blue velvet cape that she wore around her neck,\nAnd the red in her cheeks gave a Rag Doll effect.\n\nThe wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad song,\nI lie in my bed listenin' all night long.\n...\n\n", 
        "I watch the distant lights on the runway\nDisappear into the evening sky\nOh you know I'm with you on your journey\nNever could say goodbye\n\nIt's not the sun you're trying to find\nSomething else is on your mind\nYou need a little space and time\nTo break away\nIt's not the place you're going to\nIt's just a phase you're going through\nThough I won't stop you I don't want you to\n\nBreak awa-a-a-a-ay\nFly across your ocean\n...\n\n", 
        "Clearing skies and drying eyes, now I see your smile.\nDarkness goes and softness shows a changing style.\nJust in time, words that rhyme, well bless your soul.\nNow I'll fill your hands with kisses and a Tootsie Roll.\nReality, it's not for me and it makes me laugh.\nBut fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back.\n\nPatti Page and summer days on old Cape Cod.\n...\n\n", 
        "A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road,\nIt's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone,\nIt's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun,\nIt is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun.\nThe oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush,\nThe nod of the wood, the song of a thrush,\nThe wood of the wing, a cliff, a fall,\nA scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all.\nIt's the wind blowing free, it's the end of a slope,\nIt's a bean, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope.\nAnd the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,\nIt's the end of the strain, it's the joy in your heart.\nThe foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone,\n...\n\n", 
        "In my little town\nI grew up believ--ing\nGod keeps his eye on us all\nAnd he used to lean upon me\nAs I pledged allegiance to the wall\nLord I recall\nMy little town\n\nComing home after school\nFlying my bike past the gates\nOf the factories\nMy mom doing the laundry\nHanging our shirts\n...\n\n", 
        "My love must be a kind of blind love\nI can't see anyone but you\n\nAre the stars out tonight?\nI don't know if it's cloudy or bright\nI only have eyes for you, dear\n\nThe moon may be high\nBut I can't see a thing in the sky\n'Cause I only have eyes for you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been so unlucky, I'm no good at playing games,\nI remember their faces, forget their names.\nThought I'd found the right one, but she hasn't found me,\nso I bundle up my emotions and start looking for the right one.\nBut will the right one ever come along?\nOh, I'm looking for the right one, when will the right one come along?\n...\n\n", 
        "Keeping my eyes on the road I see you,\nKeeping my hands on the wheel I hold you,\nNinety-nine miles from L.A.\nI kiss you, I miss you,\nPlease be there.\n\nPassing a white sandy beach we're sailing,\n...\n\n", 
        "It's The Same Old Tears On A New Background,\nSeeing you as a fading photograph\nIt hurts too much to laugh these days.\nI'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right.\nIt's the same old song with a new melody,\n...\n\n"
