        "You know I get a funny feeling\nLike an epidemic running through my head\nKnow I've got that feeling that's the best\nGot the Zuton Fever in my head\nAnd when it's running through my bones\nYou know I feel just like I'm ten years old\nKnow looking young and good again\nGot the Zuton Fever in my head\n\nIt starts to make its way upstairs\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't get this pressure point out of my head\nI can't get this pressure point out of my head\nI feel it in work, you know, I feel it in bed\nI can't get this pressure point out of my head\nI've paid all my bills and I've acted so well\nAin't been cheating, there's nothing to tell\nSo why all this pressure, I don't understand\nI call on my neighbours, and lend them a hand\n\nDoctor, oh doctor, I'm willing to learn\nWell all of my bones, well they toss and they turn\nMother, oh mother, I'm begging you please\nTo rid me of madness and cure this disease\n...\n\n", 
        "You will you won't, you do you don't\nYou're sayin' you will but you know you won't\nYou may you might, your chest gets tight\nYou say you love day but you come out at night\n\nWhile your thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' up a storm in you\nAll the things you're thinkin' are they false, are they true\nYou know the dipsydoodle rag, it tells no lie\nBut all the time you're thinkin', well you're trickin' your mind\n\nWell you will you won't, you do you don't\nYou're sayin' you will but you know you won't\nYou may you might, your chest gets tight\n...\n\n", 
        "It's funny how it tears me apart\nWell, first it breaks your head then your heart\nI should've loved you better\nFrom the start\n\nIt's chewin' at my bones and my brains\nIt's workin' through the flesh that remains\nWhy can't this feelin' leave me\nAnd just fade away?\n\nFrom day one, I led you on\n...\n\n", 
        "Well the cops are at the door\nAnd you know that they want more\nThey've got spears, made for arms\nTried to lure you with their charms\nYou can hear the guns outside\nWatching riots with their eyes\nAs you move from wall to wall\nHear the siren from the gang brawl\n\nLine the locals one by one\nFilling bullets with their guns\nAre you red, or if you're blue\nCause tonight their gonna find the truth\n\nTake no prisoners today\nFor the future will be laid\nOne big city, one big town\nEveryone with the same crown\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Although I've left you darling\nI'll soon be back again\nThat's what I said in China\nWhere all the work was dead\nI hope you get my letters\nI'll write them every day\nI'll soon be heading eastwards\nI'm hammering the nails\n\nI'm working on the railroad\nI dig away the time\nI'm singing to the worksong\nWith memories in mind\n\nI'll sail to Hong Kong harbour\nThe winds were warmer there\n...\n\n", 
        "Long time coming\nBut no one seen it coming\nLong gone then\nAnd your heart is still running\nNow you're thinking bout the times\nAnd the things you should've done\nWell you might as well forget it\nIn the end you have won\n\nLong-gone letters\n...\n\n", 
        "Last night, I had a bad dream\nAnd it blew my head away\nAnd there was no solution\nAnd I've been awake all day\n\nAnd all I see is horror\nAnd it creeps beneath my skin\nWell, I'm knocking for my nightmare\nAnd it just won't let me in\n\nThere were grandmas that were choking\nAnd clinging to the necks\nAnd the mothers, they just lied there\nWhile blood gushed from their heads\n\nAnd the fathers, they were screaming\nWhile priests were being sick\nAnd the vomit hit the ceiling\n...\n\n", 
        "Sunday afternoon, not a lot to do,\n(Think of all)\nThe places i could be, the people i could meet,\n(Life so small)\nI'm watching drops of rain on my window pane,\n(Empty streets)\nAnd no-one knocks around, no-one goes to to town,\n\nIm a going out, sick of staying in,\n...\n\n", 
        "Well we used to be the best of friends\nAnd we used to hang around\nNow I always see you and your new girlfriend\nOn the sunny side of town\nOh your body is the same and your face ain't changed\nBut your mind ain't where it's at\nYou're too busy hugging and a-kissing now\nAnd for you that can't be bad\n\nBut I've made a deal with the clouds\nGonna turn that sun into rain\nSo you forget about your love\nCome and see me again\n\nOh remember me I'm your best friend\nAnd we don't talk no more\n...\n\n", 
        "Long time coming\nBut no one seen it coming\nLong gone then\nAnd your heart is still running\nNow you're thinking bout the times\nAnd the things you should've done\nWell you might as well forget it\nIn the end you have won\n\nLong-gone letters\n...\n\n", 
        "You know I get a funny feeling\nLike an epidemic running through my head\nKnow I've got that feeling that's the best\nGot the Zuton Fever in my head\nAnd when it's running through my bones\nYou know I feel just like I'm ten years old\nKnow looking young and good again\nGot the Zuton Fever in my head\n\nIt starts to make its way upstairs\n...\n\n", 
        "I was sold a story with a new beginning,\nI missed out the middle and came into an end,\nThat was told by a man with a different posture,\nTurn around and I'll meet you at the end,\nI walk along think nothing can touch me\nI missed out the car and found myself in hell,\nAt the gate is a guy says I got a second chance,\nTurn around and pick one off the shelf,\nI said pick one off the shelf,\n\nCos I've sold my whole life away,\nNo more riches or fame,\nAnd all I had to do was change,\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I was born 6ft Tall with no lovin at all\nI had to rummage through my life of misery\nI had to go from place to place never recognise my face\nIm the moody man you never ever see\nWell one day I placed a bet with the money I had left\nWould not know what the future held for me\nThrough all the suffering and the pain but theres one thing that Ive gained\nThats the patience that I now receive\n\n...\n\n"
