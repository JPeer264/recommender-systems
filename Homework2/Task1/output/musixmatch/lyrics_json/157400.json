        "Covered in blood he comes home\nTears off his clothes\nTo throw them away\nHoping they'll hide from his wife and five year old girl\nWho'll want him to play\n\nAs he washes his hand and his face\nThe sink turns to red\nAnd then back to white\nIn the back of his mind\nHe tells himself it's just a job\nAnd I'll be alright\n\nAs he lies awake\nHis wife pulls him closer and says\nDid you see that storm\nWhen I picked up our daughter from school\nThe sky turned to black\nAnd the thunder it roared\nI was afraid that you were stuck out in the rain with those thieves\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
