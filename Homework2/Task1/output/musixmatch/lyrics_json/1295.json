        "Now -\nThe mist across the window hides the lines\nBut nothing hides the colour of the lights that shine\nElectricity so fine\nLook and dry your eyes\nWe -\nSo tired of all the darkness in our lives\nWith no more angry words to say\nCan come alive\nGet into a car and drive\nTo the other side\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
