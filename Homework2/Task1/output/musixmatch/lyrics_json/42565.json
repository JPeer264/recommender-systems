        "I'm done telling you that I'm in love\nWhat I have will never be enough\nCome on baby, go live life on your own\nEverything inside is breaking down\nAnd you don't want to be hanging around\nI don't think I want to leave myself alone\n\nI'm done having to apologize\nI'm done living inside your eyes\nWhen the lights go out what's left to know\nNothing ever makes sense to me\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah, I don't think I'm alive\nDead footsteps, another outcast screaming alone\nGod help me, give me what you want\nGive me what you need, I'll take it all\nStand fall, lost out, baby, yes I know\n\nIt's not a secret, a false alarm\nAnother front page\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby's got cancer, looking for the answer\nShe's got cancer, someone romance her\nShe was one of a kind\n\nNow she's perfected\nLiving on all the lies they injected\nNow she's staring at the scars that needed correction\nIt's not a habit she claims\nShe's got American eyes\nLetting her body go, she's dead\n...\n\n", 
        "Say enough words to make me forget\nUntil I get dangerous and desperate\nI love it when I'm telling myself lies\nThe good ones that I know I can cash\n\nStare at my face until I neglect\nEverything I couldn't forgive\nLook at the way you make me\nLive choking like a fucking kid\n\nI rejected faith, I broke a good heart\nAnd I regret love because you told me\nI still don't care, I wasn't meant to cover up scars\nBuilt on faults\n...\n\n", 
        "What's left of California?\nWhat's left of Los Angeles?\n\nSidewalks cry 'cause they're not as high\nShooting old dope\nRich kid skies are a good disguise\nLining our veins with hope\n\nWhat did you get for free and where you gonna sell it?\nWhy should I give a shit cover up your face lift?\nWhat's left of my broken heart what's left of Los Angeles\n\nWe got a new design\nExcess redefined so you can dream it\nWe rewrote the standards\n...\n\n", 
        "All this time I've been unclean\nWatching you 'cause you're watching me\nShotgun knives into my heart without a reason\n\nAll I want is to never die\nFuck the beats of a different heart\nWhat I'll do if you never tell\nBleed me an answer\n\nWe got chills\nI break it down and build again, sit still\n\nLine me up so I can burn\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't know where I should begin\nMy scars have overrun my skin\nFrustrations taken all my patience\nExposing everything inside\n\nThe more time that I spend alone is\nThe more time that I hate myself\nIt's one thing not to finish in the first place\nAnother thing not to finish at all\n\nI can't stand here and listen to bullshit\nAnd everything you own\nCan't stand, 'cos I live alone\nWatching shadows fall\n\n...\n\n",
