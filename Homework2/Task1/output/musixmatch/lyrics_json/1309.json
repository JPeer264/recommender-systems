        "I dream, dream of a lonely girl\nWho sleeps, lost in her lonely world\nAny sunset I'd give to you\nAny colour that you like, all for you\nAll for you\n\nShe wakes wrapped in her naked room\n...\n\n", 
        "I have learnt through all my past mistakes\nNot to let the hurdles sap my energy\nTime will tell and time is all it takes\nYou won't see the bastards knock the running out of me\n\nAnd the band, they played one more song\nOne for the mocking bird, they played one more song\nAll the tears, they fell one by one\nAll for the mocking-bird, they fell one by one\n\nDon't be fooled by those who feed you words\n...\n\n", 
        "One, two, three, four\n\nOooh, oo oooh, cha\n\nCatch my breath, close my eyes\nDon't believe a word\nThings she said, overheard\nSomething wrong inside\nHits you in a minute, oooh\nThen you know you're in it, aah\n\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\n...\n\n", 
        "Put it down to the fighting\nPut it down to the fools who play in the game\nI'm picking up second sight\nI'm picking up tired ways\nBut you better believe it\nOh you better believe before it's too late\nI'm feeling like letting go\nOf living in a dangerous time\n\nIt must've been lonely, it must've been cold\n...\n\n", 
        "Midnight, feels like it's shining on me\nMoonlight, taxis rollin' from the sea\nShots in the dark, slaves to the big city beat\nHeroes, toasted and sent to the wall\nZeros, bleed you and laugh in your face\nMy kind of town, anywhere else but this place\nBut who can walk on the water\n\nI can help this fear of falling\nI can help this fear of letting go\nI can help this fear of falling\nI can help this fear of letting go\n\nHold on, check out and check out the fools\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight\nIt must have been something you said\nI just died in your arms tonight\n\nI keep looking for something I can't get\nBroken hearts lie all around me\nAnd I don't see an easy way to get out of this\nHer diary it sits by the bedside table\nThe curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle\nWho would've thought that a boy like me could come to this\n\nOh I, I just died in your arms tonight\nIt must've been something you said\nI just died in your arms tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "I never knew what it meant to me\n'Til someone just took the best of me\nIf it's some kind of conspiracy\nThen no one gets to the rest of me\nI'm turning over leaves, I'm holding up my head\nI'm healing over hurt and learning to forget\nI said, \"Don't look back, let it fade and let it go\nDon't look back, let it fade and let it go\", oooh\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't let love let you down\nIt's been fine up to now\nSahara, I just walked into your world\nSahara, don't walk out on me now\n\nDon't let time tie you down\nIt's been fine up to now\nSahara, there is life in the desert\nSahara, let the sands run away\n\nBut in my heart and in my head\nI know that she'll wait for me\nOoh, Sahara brings me down\n...\n\n", 
        "Too many times have I told you, feel your way\nIf it's question of answers, then have your say\nDon't go giving me reasons, we all have a price\nAnd in that moment of indecision, you'll never understand why\n\nIt shouldn't take too long, to set the thing moving\nIt shouldn't take too long, so long as you believe it\nIt shouldn't take too long\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Believe me when I say to you that every word is true\nOh, that a change is goin' to come\nYou can hear it in the broadcast on your radio\n\nOoh, why are you runnin'? Was it somethin' that somebody said?\nWhat are you hidin' from? Are the voices alone in your head?\nI can make it look natural 'cause the more that you see\nIt's the less that you know, it's the more that you give\n\nBelieve me when they call for you as you cry out in the night\nThese four suspicious riders have been circling\nThe borders of your bungalow\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I have learnt through all my past mistakes\nNot to let the hurdles sap my energy\nTime will tell and time is all it takes\nYou won't see the bastards knock the running out of me\n\nAnd the band, they played one more song\nOne for the mocking bird, they played one more song\nAll the tears, they fell one by one\nAll for the mocking-bird, they fell one by one\n\nDon't be fooled by those who feed you words\n...\n\n",

        "It doesn't really matter what you think of him\nIt couldn't happen to a nicer boy\nSilver charms, golden opportunities\nIt doesn't matter, it doesn't matter\nIt couldn't happen\n\nHas an obsession, personal security\nHe won a medal working overseas\nDouble vision piling on the agony\nHe's just looking, he's just running / He's just looking, he's just working\n\nFor a mirror and blade\nSeeing double and he's fading fast (no oh)\n...\n\n",

        "Some things get started\nSome things get finished then fade away,\nBut some of us made our own rules from the start\nA year in the wilderness\nWe sat it out now we're home again\nAnd playin'...\nInto the den with the lions\nToo many good friends I lost\nThey say it's a price you pay\n...\n\n", 
        "Boys and girls will see in time\nThat they were wrong to go\nFires don't burn at home, like they\nUsed to burn, those nights\nGrew so long\n\nThe scattering\n(All the children say)\nWill come again\n(It's taken them away)\nNo seeds to fall\n(All the children say)\nNo sons to blame\nAs one by one they left home\n\nTired old men\n...\n\n", 
        "One more to tie to the whipping post\nPapers that peddle the holy ghost\nOnce more the victim of circumstance pays\n\nIf paper plates serve the final feast\nSharpen your knives for a front page piece\nSitting safe in the front row seats\n\nYou make a big noise\nBig fire\nBig noise\nYou and the big boys are playin' with fire\n...\n\n", 
        "If you should walk away\nTake this broken heart\nAnd if you walk away\nYou'll never know what's left behind\nGo on and get away\nDon't you leave a trace\nAnd as you walk away\nYou can take most every...\nEverything but my pride\nEverything but the rings on my finger\nEverything but my pride\nI like the room this way\nI like this bed unmade\nWe never laughed enough\nBut you laugh alone today\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't talk about commitment\nDon't talk about it here\nDon't talk about the Russians\nDon't mention your fears\nDon't talk about the black man\nDon't talk about the rope\nIt only causes problems\nWe got plenty of those, I said\n\nDon't talk about it, don't talk\nDon't talk about it, don't talk\nDon't talk about it, don't talk\nDon't talk about it, don't talk...\n\n(Don't talk about it)\n...\n\n", 
        "Welcome to this groove\nAnd now one, two, three, four\n\nBetween a rock\nBetween a rock and a hard place\n\nThere's a beating heart\nWatching the lights go down on my world\nStoney faced\nLetting the rope slip though my fingers\nAin't nothin' straight, always a riddle\nCaught up in the middle of the party line\nI got a brick but I can't find a window\nTake me to your shelter...\n\nBetween a rock\n...\n\n",
