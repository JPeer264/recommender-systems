        "The bleak fimbul winter arrived\nRaging across the world\nWith a fury that defied the memory of man\nTerrible wars where fought,\nthe like had never been seen\nMen slew without a thought\nThe ties of kinship were no more\n\nSkoll and Hati, the ravenous wolves\nArose and devoured the sun and the moon\nDarkness descended upon the earth\nAnd the stars fell from the skies\n...\n\n", 
        "Surtur comes from the south\nWith red hot fire wargods swords\nshines like the sun\nMountains breaks, men on hel-road\nThe heaven crumbles, Ragnarok is at hand\n\nThen to Hlin appears\nAnother grief when Odin goes to fight\nThe evil Fenris\nAnd the brave and glory Frey\n...\n\n", 
        "A battle on distant shore\nSeawolves warth sweep the land\nDown from the skies Valkyries ride\nAnd walk the field halowed by Tyr\nThe fight is hard, axes are swung\nSwords bite sharp, men are slewn\nThe ground turns red, bloodsoaked field\nDead man's last bed and Odin sees\n\nVikings fall, in blood they lie\nThe webs of Norn's, they've met their fate\nWith shield and sword they've benn brought in pride\nTo the mighty doors of the Speargod's hall\n\nThe gates open and into the hall of braves\nThe silently walk\n...\n\n", 
        "Grey clouds - cover the winter sky\nCold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground\n\nThe icy wind\nPierces the skin of waiting warriors\nLike spears\nWill pierce their bodies in battle\n\nFrosted\nBeards on pale grey faces\nEyes of death\nAre burning with rage\n\nGlancing across the fields of Tyr\nIn the early morning light\n\n...\n\n", 
        "As His Life's blood leaving\nI hold my son, my only son\nAnd tears fill my burning eyes\n\nWhile his skin turns pale as snow\nButchered he lies here bleeding in my arms\nSlewn by the men of the single god\nHatred burns in my chest\n\nRain falls from a raging heaven\nThe wind howls like wolves at the moon\nI will seek my vengeance for my son\n\nI swear I'll avenge my first born one\n...\n\n", 
        "Alone he stands in the doorway,\nHis family's still asleep.\nGazing at the starlit horizon\nAnd the moonsparking sea.\n\nWhen dawn comes he must leave them,\nHis home, his children and loved.\nFor his destiny beyond those waves\nKnown only to the Norns.\n\nHe's already dressed ready to leave,\nHis four friends are waiting by the shore.\nEach with a dragon ship\nAnd one hundred men prepared for war.\n...\n\n", 
        "I see\nWithout fear my destiny\nAs the raging skies begins to fade\nPouring rain\nLicks my wounds as my blood flows\nFrom my torn flesh!\n\nAs I die\nI hold my sword\nMy only friend\nAnd pray that Oden\nWill take me home\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Ten heavy feet\nWalks the bloodsoiled ground\nWith rhythm these\nFive warriors march\n\nNo matter how much\nThe bleeding wounds\nFrom enemy swordcuts\nHurts to the bone\n\nThe revenge they sought\nWas taken in blood\nNo mercy was showed\nNo mercy was showed\n\nThey ignore the pain\nThat hammerlike pounds\nFrom falls, off slain\n...\n\n", 
        "Salt water licks my face\nand wind fills the sail\nWe head for wars on distant shores\n\nMy friends are all with me\nAnd so they'll always be\nWe'll never bend until the end\n\nWe cross the open waves\nOn course to far off lands\nThor guides our ships\n...\n\n", 
        "They came riding down the slopes\nFive fearless men prepared to fight\nWe heard with fear the rumbling earth\nIn the mid-day light\n\nSurprised we saw all terrified\nThe brave northmen's run\nThe fearless five with power ride\nAttacking us in the mid-day sun\n\nTheir charge was fast, no alarm was sound\nThey broke right through our lines\nI felt the cut it threw me to the ground\nAnd now I feel has come my time\n\nI lie here in my blood\nAnd see my family get killed\nI feel abandoned by my god\nI fear death's chill\n...\n\n", 
        "A storm rolls in from the sea\nCovering the land with black thunder clouds\nRain whips the ground at their feet\nAs they come ashore in this foreign land\n\nThunder breaks the silence of five hundred men assembled on shore\nGazing through the misty rain\nAt the mountain not a mile away\nSo dark and silent it stands there\nThe mighty AMON AMARTH\nReaching for the cloudcloked sky\nSo grim and fearful in might\n\nWith the wind in their backs they start walking\nDecisive men of the north\nThey stride through this darkened land\nWith only mount doom in their sight\n...\n\n", 
        "Rumbling thunder cracks the sky\nAnd rain starts pouring down\nLightning strikes a cold bright light\nUpon the blooddrenched ground\n\nThe sword play is hard\nAnd many falls\nSteel bites sharp in flesh\nAnd upon a mountain\nTowering tall\nStands the messengers of death\n\nFive horsemen in armour bright\nWaiting in the flashing light\n...\n\n", 
        "Zehn schwere Stiefel\nber Grund blutgetr\u00e4nkt\nIm Gleichschritt marschieren\nDiese f\u00ecnf Krieger\n\nEs ist Ihnen gleich\nWie sehr Ihre Wunden\nVon feindlichen Schwertern geschlagen\nBis auf die Knochen schmerzen\n\nDie herbeigesehnte Rache\nBegangen in Blut\nKeine Gnade gezeigt\nKeine Gnade gezeigt\n\nDen Schmerz verleugnend\nDer wie ein Hammer pocht\nErlitten durch St\u00ecrze\n...\n\n", 
        "As His Life's blood leaving\nI hold my son, my only son\nAnd tears fill my burning eyes\n\nWhile his skin turns pale as snow\nButchered he lies here bleeding in my arms\nSlewn by the men of the single god\nHatred burns in my chest\n\nRain falls from a raging heaven\nThe wind howls like wolves at the moon\nI will seek my vengeance for my son\nI swear I'll avenge my first born one\n\n...\n\n"
