        "With the old days born anew\nA Massive gathering of onlookers\nSending birds to shelter the shipwrecked\nWith feathers of dust and wind\nEmerging from the fiery fields\n\nWe're all being stepped on like insects\nA million minds weeping\nThis boundless energy\nThis synergy\nIt's better contained\n\nWe are so free\nAnd what a superb absence is our soul\nDesire is a liar\nBlueprint of mankind's weakness\n\nAbsolute absolution\nCriticize criticism\n\nWe are weighed down every moment\nBy the merciless sensation of time\n...\n\n",

It's all inside - It's all in silence\nWhen the raven gets its way\nA Million thoughts are swept away\nAnd then you leave it all\n...\n\n", 
        "Now it's always been a riddle\nMisanthrope, you always pursued a valid reason\nYou know, to be wrong with a reason \u2013 You are what you are\nBut your ever present subliminal self bends the black \u2013 You sleep so tight\nbut dreamless \u2013 Facing forward \u2013 Dawn's edge, the supplement to destiny's ender\nYou smother all the words you have never said, with a mouth filled with empathy\nWords can be an enemy \u2013 you can never say you're sorry \u2018cause you're a pretender\nUnpretend \u2013 Fall from grace \u2013 unconcealed \u2013 Just a phase \u2013 Summer's bruise \u2013 Turn a wrench\nBottled thoughts \u2013 Blind eye stare \u2013 Look out of the window\nYou stare in the face of a widow \u2013 Drink up, like a lover \u2013 You recreate all that's over\nThe turn of the tide \u2013 You're used up \u2013 Just take it like a man, All you must do is confess\n...\n\n", 
        "Eyes \u2013 a thousand eyes waiting below the waves \u2013 Because above the rain burns\nMy past becomes a lie\nGoodbye sense of awareness \u2013 I drink adrenaline like mother's milk, it soothes me\nRemove all that I trust, all I'm ashamed for, state of remission, I feed of the vulture\nI'm left breathless \u2013 The Battle is lost\nOne step takes a thousand miles \u2013 One black circle where I expected sun\nOne blind spot \u2013 One eye for a thousand eyes\nWhere I begun: underwater I'm reborn\nI got stuck in the nether on a lonely cloud, while the heat burns my feathers\nWe're all homeward bound \u2013 With a roar I dive down and I greet the seas\n...\n\n", 
        "Meet your shadow-self\nYour dynamic demon side\nPleased to meet you\nAre you the rebel or the fool?\n\nInspiration or regression?\nThese dark waters are treacherous!\n'Cause you never run, never will\nNever dream fast enough\nTo beat the runner\n\nJester's chronic laughter\nStatic discharge failure\nViolence\nFailsafe system running erratic\nCleanse me,\u00ed\u00b4m filthy\nHeartbeats sing a song of change and\nWith sleep come the spoils\nThe nearing dawn yawns\nWith glistering teeth\nMy body shakes like the rattlesnakes tail\n\nHear the bones\n...\n\n", 
        "In pain there's a lesson\nIn blood there's a slithering form travelling\nThrough the veins, Through the body, amending\nBurnt skin and broken bones\nDon't deny it: we're all snakes at first\nAnd then we change again\n\nWe are the strangers of today\nReach out, forever in the dark\n\nIn pain there's a moment\nIn blood there's a final story written\nSo the better you make me\nI'm less man and more machine\nEngaged in guessing, I'm lost for words\nI'm never gone\nI reach out for the serpent\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I wander aimlessly\nDivided like a restless sea\nI remember messengers\nSifting through the boiling sand\nLooking for a shaken hand\nWading through the mire\nBut never find what they desire\n\nHear my voice calling\n\nA butterfly caught\nInvisible wall\nKeep away from light\n...\n\n", 
        "Here's my only dream\nWhile I breathe dopamine\nMy creature's cunning\nIt walks the road between sense and amphetamine\n\nClearly an ominous presence\nSeraphs belong only to the ones who wait\nI can feel it combine me\nMerging all of my instincts with the withering beast\n\nWe dance around in a ring and suppose\nBut the secret sits in the middle and knows\nSkies are ashen, dim summer stench\nUncontrollable aesthetics relapse this twilight as dawn\n\nFaster, suppressor, a silent storm approaching\nBehold a black-chalked figurine -- it speaks to me in tongues\nI resist my dislocation\n...\n\n"
