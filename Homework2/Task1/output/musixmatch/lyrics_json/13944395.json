        "You want the fruit that hits the ground.\nYou like the taste in your mouth.\nBitter-sweet, broken down,\nLeaves you feeling wanted.\nI was born in the water,\nLet me loose, I'm hunting.\nNature was like a shark;\nSend the seeds out in the world.\n\nI see a home behind your eyes;\nI sleep forever waiting for it.\nThese open skies where I belong;\nYou put a roof over me.\n\nHope I don't wake up before you let the light in.\nI hope I never see what goes on while I'm sleeping.\nHearts & daggers\nThey seem to go together\nLike fire burning the rain.\n...\n\n", 
        "Little pieces\nSticky pieces\nOf me and you, of me and you.\nAs the glue wears off,\nImma break in two.\nCan you hold my hand?\nWill you hold my hand?\n\nSo while you're there\nAnd I'm still here.\nThe simple things,\nYour simple things,\nThat I used to hate,\nLike your pissed off face.\nThe one you used to make\nWhen I came home late.\n\nAs the 135 is delayed,\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time\nI feel alive and the world turning inside out Yeah!\nAnd floating around in ecstasy\nSo don't stop me now don't stop me\n'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time\n\nI'm a shooting star leaping through the sky\nLike a tiger defying the laws of gravity\nI'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva\nI'm gonna go go go\nThere's no stopping me\n\nI'm burning through the sky Yeah!\nTwo hundred degrees\nThat's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit\nI'm trav'ling at the speed of light\nI wanna make a supersonic man out of you\n\nDon't stop me now I'm having such a good time\n...\n\n", 
        "They didn't want me\nWhen I was running wild\nThe dragons breathing fire\nIn the backyard at night\n\nWe live in circles\nAnd it's so hard to breathe\nMaybe the same old fears\nWhat have we here?\nDon't bring me down\nWith you\n\nNow I'm just chasing time\nWith a thousand dreams I'm holding heavy\nAnd as we cross the line these fading beats have all been severed\nDon't tell me our youth is running out\nIt's only just begun\n...\n\n", 
        "I can hear your thoughts\nPlease don't leave now\nI can't sleep alone\nChasing the light until the dawn\n\nThought we left a trail\nBack to the way that it was\nI can see it now\nIn your eyes you let it fall\n\nRunning in a crypt\nOf a thousand words\nHiding in the dark\n\nWhere the violence starts\n\nLooking for a star\nWe've gone too far\nToo far\nDon't hide in the dark\n\nPlaying shadow games\nTurn out the lights uuu\n...\n\n", 
        "Fell from the sky\nWe fell from the sky and started walking\nLeavin' our footprints on the ground\n\nIt might be a prayer\nOr maybe a piece of conversation\nWherever we go we make a sound\n\nSo I call your name, the only thing I know\nIs I need you here, will you be gone forever?\nAll that I know, all that I know is we're here tonight\nTurn off the lights\n\nLet go for tonight baby\nLet love in your life and be shown (turn off the lights)\nLet go for tonight baby, who needs sleep tonight?\nI need to let go, let go\nLet go, let go, turn off the lights\nLet love in your life baby, who needs sleep tonight?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hollow ground and I keep on falling\nBreathing in, but it's not enough\nWhen I drown my eyes in the river flowing\nYou said you'd stay just a little more\n\nCause the faith isn't gone, I still hear it calling\nBut something is wrong, teardrops are falling\nBut just before they hit the ground\nOh, when I hear you say\nOh, when I hear you say\n\nDont give it up, don't give it up, it's glorious\nDon' give it up, don't give it up, it's glorious\n...\n\n", 
        "Why are we so obsessed with cutting skin\nWhen the real things in our lives can't get in?\n\nMarching to the same drum\nEvery single beat's gone\nI can hear the dark days coming\n\nAnother generation\nFighting for attention\nCan't you see I'm tired of running?\n\nThere's a house in the forest\nWhere her days are forgotten\nBy the lake, she dropped her dreams\nAnd now they've sunk to the bottom\n\nOh, beauty queen\nIt's only skin deep\nIt's only thin sheets\nThere's no audience\n\nOh, beauty queen\nSomething's telling me\nThat you were never meant to be\nTrapped in time\n...\n\n", 
        "When the monsters are sleeping under your bed\nThey\u2019ve crawled out from under and into your head\nAnd outside the carcass, into your skin\nAnd you need someone to keep it like it\u2019s said\n\nYour wishes into the air\nSo someone listens, someone is there\nAnd you won\u2019t know anything about it\nUntil you have to live without it\n\nChasin\u2019 the fire for you\nLight in the night in bed\nWatching from high above you\n\nIf you can make it then you saved your eyes\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you closed your eyes before you wake up\n...\n\n",

        "I've been dreaming over\nI've been dreaming over half the lies\nYou've been looking at me\nYou've been looking at me eye to eye\nTake it easy, lift your feet up off the burning ground\nYou don't see it, you get so high cause you don't look down\nShe wants to hold you in her arms\nShe wants to tear you away from my heart\nDoes she light up like a lantern, to show you a way through the dark\nDoes she give you what you're missing? It's more than enough where we are\n...\n\n",
