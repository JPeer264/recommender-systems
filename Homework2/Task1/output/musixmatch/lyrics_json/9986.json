        "When you're on your own\nYou walk in the rain\nYou walk around the house\nThen walk around it again\n\nYou pretend you're happy\nThat you've got it all\nBut don't be upset If you fall on your knees\nAnd beg like a dog\n\nI've reached a low, don't you know\nYou're the apple of my eye\nI'm running low, with this show\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Hey baby Jane, you have been climbing down the drain\nAnd you run in the rain to the playground climbing frame\nAnd the air seems so good and moist and cool\nWhen you meet him by the swimming pool\n\nWhat's a girl to do?\nWhen you're locked up in Mother Goose's shoe\n\nAnd you're hanging, and you're hanging\nAnd you're hanging with the wrong crowd\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Sometimes I'm afraid of my shadow\nIt's always following me\nIn my home in an old trombone lives a family of bumblebees\nAnd I'm fearful of the sharp sting that fractures through the skin\nWalking on the dark scorched earth\n\nAnd I've become misguided\nBecome misguided\nNo I couldn't hide it\nNo I couldn't hide it\n\nWith things hanging out in the floorboards\nShuffling back and forth\nCan't get to sleep and dream of jumping sheep\nAnd I can hear the wind blow north\nAnd I'm fearful of the sharp sting that fractures through the skin\nWalking in the dark scorched earth\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
