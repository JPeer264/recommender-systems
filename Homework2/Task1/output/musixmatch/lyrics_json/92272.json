        "Seems like these days the whole world's on fire\nThings keep blowing the hell up\nAnd while all those rubber neckers and lucky louies stand and slackjaw's staring\nThe real men have the nuts to walk away\n\nYeah\n\nCool guys don't look at explosions\nThey blow things up and then walk away\nWho's got time to watch an explosion\nCause cool guy's errand's that they have to walk too\n\nKeep walking, keep shining\nDon't look back, keep on walking\nKeep struttin', slow motion\nThe more you ignore it, the cooler you look\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

The lights went down, time for the entertainment\"\nA magician took the stage and sawed a lady in half\nI could see her legs - so fake, made me laugh\nThen they asked for a volunteer from the audience\nI hid my face - no way, leave me out of it!\nNext thing I know, my girlie's volunteering for me\nShe tells me she thinks \"men on stage are very sexy\"\nSo I play along, and go up on stage\nHoping that the stunt will get me... ya know!\nSo now they want to hypnotize me\nThey'll ring a bell and I'll cluck like a turkey\nI say, \"Yeah right, do your best.\nThis whole thing is faker than Pam Anderson's chest\"\nBig laugh from the audience, they loved that joke\nThen appeared the hypnotist in a cloud of smoke\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
