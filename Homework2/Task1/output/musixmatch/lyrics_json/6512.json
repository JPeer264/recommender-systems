        "The deal was rigged\nThere's darkness in my soul\nI want to die again\n\nAn empty soul shrouded in darkness\nAlone and confused what am I?\nImages flash memories jaded\nHe took my life God damn his lies\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't believe this now\nThis isn't what I planned\nI lived and died and now\nI just can't understand\nWith all the love I feel\nI could never leave her\nNo matter what the cost\nMy souls the price to see her\n\n(Chorus)\nOh how I love you\n...\n\n", 
        "Enter now the fiendish one\nTwisted little man\nVile wretch disgusting mess\nPerverted little man\nBorn of hell and in disease\nHate festers in his veins\nDemonic clown and shapeshifter\nLittle man gone insane\n...\n\n", 
        "A force of light, an angel\nSent through time to destroy\nAvenging the dark ones\nDescending angelic force\n\nHeaven sent the hunter\nHer mission to crucify\nSlay the hellspawn\n...\n\n", 
        "My personal quest is to make your life hell\nyes dear friend listen up well\nthe power i've given i can take as well\ni am your father destroyer of the light\ni've taken your soul and have given you life\nyou are the damned condemned by my hand\nmy son creature of the night\nin your hour of darkness\nyou warm my soul\nand deep in you as i make my hole\ngod won't save you\nyour souls been sold\n...\n\n", 
        "Angels coming from above\nTake the essence of his love\nChallengers call him from all around\nDemons coming from the ground\n\nBattles won and nothing gained\n...\n\n", 
        "Hear now this story of the man that should not be\nA ghoul of blackened torment, sullen atrocity\nA kindred soul to the devils own, malignance personified\nCast from his fire he molests the purest light\n\nProfane to humanity menaced by flesh and bone\nScreams of the unknown youth to him the sweetest tone\nUndying in his will to kill his bloodlust is profound\n...\n\n", 
        "Darkness calls down to me\nSweat pours from my body like rain\nGrowing wiser with each touch\nA pawn in lucifers game, am I?\n\nIt attacks me in the black abyss\nThe entity formless yet full of rage\nThe mark of the beast my body\n...\n\n", 
        "A twisted state of mind, torn between two worlds\nOne of which the new me hates and the one that's coming true\nThe power is unleashed, they perish at my gaze\nBut am I really in control or am I just a slave\n\nI called upon this god to deliver unto me\nTo grant what I desire he brought me to my knees\nHe turned his back on me and filled me with his lies\nAsk and I received damnation was the price\n...\n\n", 
        "The time is close now, the end is near\nMy walk through the valley, trails of fear\nI feel empty, my penance overdue,\nI guess it's too late now to be with you\nI'm extremely frightened of what will surely be\nI sold myself, the death of me\nI know you can't forgive me I know I'm on my own,\nI've betrayed you I walk alone\n\nWhat exactly is the meaning of this\nJust pawns in your twisted game\nSevere pain for the lie I'm livin'\nFor a love I never could betray\n\n(Bridge)\nQuestion me not say the lord unto thee\nYou have chosen your own fate and your own destiny\nDenied of this life is what you are to be\nYou have chosen your own fate and your own destiny\n\nLord I pound my fists at you\nWon't you just let me die\nWould I not suffer enough\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "Look into the path\nAs it leads to the unknown\nWeeping willows hallow\nYou feel you're almost home\n\nStranger In the town\nYet You've been here before\nTrapped in the prison\n...\n\n", 
        "One the night the darkness fell\nAcross the naked land\nA demon force was summoned up\nFrom the bowels of hell\nThe stench of death grew thick that night\nWe knew it was the end\nWe run to find a place to hid\nThe land was raped and bare\nThe wind it blows a eerie cold\nA fog that never lifts\nTheir tears will flood the land tonight\nAnd the thunder's drowned by screams\n...\n\n", 
        "I came into this world\nA screaming infant\nForced entry into this life\nAs I grow the pain sustains\nDeep inside my soul\nVisions come and visions go\nBut hate will never leave me\nAs I grow the pain sustains\n...\n\n", 
        "Once again we have laid another loved one to rest\nAnd as we fight the grief in our hearts\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I sit, judges stand\nmy fate is held in his hand\nplease hear my plea \"Insanity\"\nI never meant to hurt no one\nit wasn't me who did the deed\nI wasn't in control\n\nThere she lay so innocent\nHer blood upon my hands\nthe memory is like a blur\nlet me explain if I can\n\n...\n\n"
