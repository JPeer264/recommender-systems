        "Far away, I feel your beating heart\nAll alone, beneath the crystal stars\nAnd staring into space, what a lonely face\nI'll try to find my place with you\n\nWhat a beautiful smile\nCan It stay for a while\nOn this beautiful night\nWe'll make everything right\nMy beautiful love\nMy beautiful love\nLarger then the moon, my love for you\n\nWorld's collide, as heaven pulls us through\nThe secret of the world is written in the stars\nI'm carrying your heart in mine\nWhat a beautiful smile\n...\n\n", 
        "I lose myself to find in me\nThe way it really ought to be\nIt's hard to say I love you\nIt's hard to say I need you\nIf all is well it's hard to tell\nIt hurts to think of someone else\nIt's hard to say I'll be there\nIt's hard to say I really, really care\n...\n\n", 
        "Ready or not the years are blurring\nRunning away the mind is turning\nSkip to the end to find the meaning\nTheoughts are fading, yet I wonder still\nLike it or not your eyes are open\nPlaying around, the circles going\nFace of a child, your mind is old\nThe clock ran down before I could begin\n\nI wish we all could win\nI wish we all could smile\nI wish we all could make our mothers proud\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Someday I'm gonna go out to the country\nI'll drive 'til the highway ends\nChasing after picture-perfect sunsets\nTo take away my breath\nI'm tired of living in the city\nThe world's got me tied on a string\nWanderlust has overcome me\nLike Lewis and Clark I'll dream\n\nThere's a million different ways to go\n...\n\n", 
        "I feel a burning, deep inside of me\nI feel your Spirit, it's moving around me\nI hear Your voice, You're calling me closer\nI know that You're here, You're calling me closer\nAnd I will...\n\nLove You with all of my heart\nJesus I'll love You with all of my mind\nJesus I'll love You with all of my soul\nJesus I'll love You with all that I am\n\nI know that You hear me when I say my prayers\n...\n\n", 
        "Until You came I was just the same\nAs everybody else\nWhoever saw the light and turned away\n\nYou love me now\nYou loved me then\nAnd every now and again\nYou show me how it would be if I'd gone the other way\n\nAfter all this time I've come to find my soul's fragility\nBut You've rectified my frailty by your strength\n\n-Chorus-\nIt's like the sun swallowed up by the earth\nLike atomics bombs in reverse\nAs if a glass could contain the sea\nThat's the way You are in me\n...\n\n", 
        "My heart is as frail as a dove\nAnd my spirit is as weak as a rose\nSee my sorrow, feel my pain\nYou're my refuge, You're my reason\nMy strength in this beautiful place\nThat's where I find God\nThat's where I find God\n\nOh, You're in my heart, You're in my soul\nYou are my Heaven, You're my home\nYou're my best friend, You're my true love\n...\n\n", 
        "Time is slipping away\nDays go by, fade away\nWith one eye opened, one closed\nI think you know\n\nLove will make you beautiful\nLove will make you beautiful\n\n...\n\n",

        "How could You walk\nWhen You went down that dusty street\nHow could You speak\nWhen all your friends checked out\nHow could You love\nAfter the great betrayal\nHow could You reach out\nWhen they nailed You down\n\nTrue as true can be\nThat's what they say You are to me\nWhen I'm so fake\nDoes Your heart ache\n...\n\n",
