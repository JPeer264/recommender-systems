        "We're reading psalms to the dead\nLighting candles to make amends\nFor a voice\nNever to speak again\n\nSix feet under for what never should've been\nStop living like you walk on water\nLooking down on all those left to drown\nAnd you know\n\nI couldn't find the words before\nOnly if I had another day left here\nI'd tell you\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a fine line between love and hate\nAnd you've crossed (crossed) them (them) both!\nIf i was a puppet then you'd be my master\nto pull my strings forever after\n\nIf I was a puppet\nyou'd be my master\nto pull my strings forever after\n...\n\n", 
        "Gouge out your eyes, pull your heart to the floor\nWith my heart, my skin, my kiss\nStand back, drop to your knees, I'll stand back as you bleed\nWith my heart, my skin, my kiss\n\nThis blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaking,\nThis knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaking\nAnd yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes, I'm shaking...\n\nGouge out your eyes, pull your heart to the floor\nSweetness loves me, tastes me, hears me\nStand back, drop to your knees, I'll stand back as you bleed\nSweetness loves me, tastes me, hears me...\n...\n\n", 
        "They said, that I can't change without you.\nThat I can't change without you.\nThat I can't change without you.\n\nThose nights I can't sleep,\nI'm stuck here.\nLost in your dreams,\nI'm stuck in here.\n\nLike why can't I get much better?\nLike why can't I get much better?\n\nSo swipe it, and take it all away,\nAnd never, never lie to me.\nSo swipe it, and take it all away,\nAnd never, never lie to me.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Turn me on, let me feel you\nTurn me on, let me taste you\nBoundaries are starting to fall\nConceiving has already started\nKissing, caressing, indulge\nIs this really what you wanted?\n\nNo, I just don't know\nIf I can\n...\n\n", 
        "You scream don't look, you scream don't touch\nWhat have they done? What have I not?\nAnd every time I think about your voice I\nStart to tremble, and my throats aching\nAnd anytime you need a shoulder, I'm right here\nYou've just gotta find a way.\n\nShe sits alone, tries to adjust\n...\n\n", 
        "If you could stay here for just\na little bit a little while a little bit with me\nyour what makes me\nand if god could keep you with me\ni'd trade just about anything\nyour what makes me want to change things\ni would die just to live and yet we all live to die\nyour what makes me want to change\n\nyou will not die\nyou will not die\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, here go my big plans\nTo build up this fortress into the clouds\nIt's made up of my love and my heart\nAnd my blood, we'll make it out\n\nWith the weight of the world, here I stand\nWith the weight of the world, here I stand\nWith the weight of the world, here I stand\nWith the weight of the world, oh\n\nAnd this is all I've got, I'll make it now or not\nIt's made up of my love\nAnd I've fought so hard to fake, our lives are meant to make\n...\n\n", 
        "Keep your eye focused this time, keep us in front of your sights, I've waited long for this, now it's our time for bliss, I just hope we have the time.\nI stand broken, please God hear my cries, He does everytime.\n\nHow many times have you watched me fall just to smile, I've been through thick and thin we've struggled through now we smile, so we're here now just be ready, brace yourself cause were not leaving.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You make me whole\nAnd I want to thank you for this\n\nI want to\nI want to thank you for\nI want to thank you for\nThank you for this\nI want to\n\nAnd I wanna thank you for this chance to be angels\nYou push me to strive harder, when I'm unable\nAnd I want you said, I need this\nAnd I want, you said, don't leave this\n\nNow's our time we're gonna make things right\nPull through tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight\nNow's our time we're gonna make things right\n...\n\n", 
        "She's pulling out her eyelashes\nFrom pain she bears\nI'm far from home, I'm all alone\nThis hole is way too deep and\nI've left behind my happy life\nAnd I'm still asking how I died\n\nLay down, lay me down pray, now\n...\n\n",
