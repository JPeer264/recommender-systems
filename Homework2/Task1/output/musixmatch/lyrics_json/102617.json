        "Sun\nYou settled down on me\nSurrender like a dream\nSatisfied now I can breathe at last\nMy lungs\nAre filled with oxygen\nMy body's back again\nCrawl out of the hole\nAnd fill it in\n\nWait\n...\n\n", 
        "THE QUESTIONS\n\nRight do you have to be cynical?\nWhat right do you have to be here at all?\nWere you pushing us aside\nWhen you went away to fight?\nWere you eating from your hands?\nWere the bad guys in command?\nCause you always seem to pass\nWhen the hard questions are asked\nTell me how long it will last\nWhat right do you have to be missing me?\nWhat right do you have to be thanking me?\nIs the number on your back\nJust to put us in our place?\nWill we ever be addressed?\nWill the surface ever crack?\n...\n\n", 
        "Everyone is turning on\nNow everyone is high\nIt's early days for everyone\nThere's still a hill to climb\nAnd nothing can stop us anymore\nThe shot that you took in the outside world\n...\n\n", 
        "Do I need a ticket\nTo buy this ride?\nConvenient it appears in front of me\n...\n\n", 
        "If i make a sound\nWill you stop everything im innocent\nWhen im not around\nWill you cover your eyes and imagine\n\nCan you hear it\nCan you see it\nFalling, falling to the ground\n\nI can see it, I can see it it's hear all around\nI can hear it when im putting my ears to the ground\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If this was a story, we'd be at the end\nSo take us back, take us back, take us back\nVoice activated technology\nPaints every room, perfectly\n...\n\n", 
        "Late gazes, window paines\nAnd in the end their not looking\nNo one gets to the wasted of mind\nSo insufficient this time\n\nSo we said lets forgive this touch\nAnd all the lies we're making\nThen the bitter of cold then hot\nWith all the sun that is burning\n...\n\n", 
        "When you're landing, do you reach out?\nThey're lining up to shoot you down\nBanging your head on the pavement\nAnd no other life is attractive\nGet your teeth in, sophistication\nTook the road and it got demoted\nThe least adapted, drive impression\nAt least appearance seems dead\n\nAnd soon the most obvious fear will arise\nThat you die in this life, and there's nowhere to go\nThe consequence is eating away at the heart\nAnd I keep forgetting how to write good songs\n...\n\n", 
        "If we all feel sorry\nWill we all feel something else\nSentiments are around it\nUp to nearest words on every page\n\nWe are born with a knowledge\nMines so different to everyone else\nAnd when our paths cross I worry\n...\n\n", 
        "Time changes\nTime changes everything\nTime changes life\nIt changes everything\n\nHere we are\nAnd half the time\nWe made it look so divine\nHere we are\n...\n\n", 
        "I wanna take a walk, rain cloud, coat on\nand the wind is blowing from the south\nI wanna climb a rock from bottom to top\nNothing is getting left behind\n\nI wanna hear your voice call me call out loud\nWhen you talk to me I'll hear you out\nI wanna space it out\nToo close move on out\nIt's all around for you to see\nIt's all I wanna see\nBut there's such a lot of baggage\n\nYou got us into this\nSo get us out of this\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes I rush\nTo get right to the end\nI know I'll get to this place\nWhen I feel the time is right\n\nSometimes I think\nThat I know what I'm all about\nBut when I look inside\nI can see the truth come out\n\nSometimes I try to go on\nI know it's wrong\nCos when I see your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "Red letters on the dashboard, oh what a GAP\nThey pursue us to the deep end and then depart\nWatch as the cracks in the wall feel pain\nFor only patterns on a snake's back give us genuine fear\n\nAnd I cannot lie, faces drop into the fire\nI get by all the time on a shelf above the door\nAnd it shouldn't be clear but it's not for me to decide\nIt's a delicate degree\nIt's a number I can see\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Once again stripping\nCause the heat walking on my feet\nMakes me tired and my own cause is too great\nWhen I steal it for myself\n\nAnd that's what brings me nearer to the rest\nAt my best it's the most I can do\n...\n\n", 
        "When you're landing, do you reach out?\nThey're lining up to shoot you down\nBanging your head on the pavement\nAnd no other life is attractive\nGet your teeth in, sophistication\nTook the road and it got demoted\nThe least adapted, drive impression\nAt least appearance seems dead\n\nAnd soon the most obvious fear will arise\nThat you die in this life, and there's nowhere to go\nThe consequence is eating away at the heart\nAnd I keep forgetting how to write good songs\n...\n\n",

        "This is what I have done\nBut everyone can be wrong\nThis is how I can lie to anybody I like\nAnd this is where i want to go\nAnd i go whenever i want to\nWhenever I want\n\nThere's an open space\nThere's an open space\nIt's an open space and boy it grows\nI've got to feel I got to let it know\nI'm no push over\nI will not fall over\n...\n\n", 
        "THE QUESTIONS\n\nRight do you have to be cynical?\nWhat right do you have to be here at all?\nWere you pushing us aside\nWhen you went away to fight?\nWere you eating from your hands?\nWere the bad guys in command?\nCause you always seem to pass\nWhen the hard questions are asked\nTell me how long it will last\nWhat right do you have to be missing me?\nWhat right do you have to be thanking me?\nIs the number on your back\nJust to put us in our place?\nWill we ever be addressed?\nWill the surface ever crack?\n...\n\n", 
        "Come on, come on\nPut your hands into the fire\nExplain, explain\nAs I turn and meet the power\nThis time, This time\nTurning white and senses dire\nPull up, pull up\nFrom one extreme to another\n\nFrom the summer to the spring\nFrom the mountain to the air\nFrom Samaritan to sin\nAnd it's waiting on the end\n...\n\n",
