        "If I said the wrong thing would you leave?\nThough my fingers may break, I just can't let you go\nDon't know why I believed you,\nNot with that promise you made me just yesterday\n\n(Chorus)\nI will always love you, take the me out of you\nA lot of people gonna be dissapointed when they find out,\nI love you and I need you\nTil my heart stops beating,\nI'll never lose this feeling\nA lot of people gonna be dissapointed when they find out\n\n3: 11 again\nThough I'm not your best friend,\nDon't you see that I will do anything to keep you with me\nClose your eyes, hold on tight, spin around, it's alright\n...\n\n", 
        "You take away\nAll that I lived for so long\nBut if you would, just wait\nMaybe it won't be that much longer\n\n(Chorus)\nIt's just your feelings\nYou're gonna shut up and let me speak\nI'll let you know what you are\nIf all you're needing\nIs a chance to be like me\nIt lets you find what you are\n\nI think I'm going to need a change\n...\n\n", 
        "I wonder what you'd do\nJust to make them like you\nJust how far you'd go\nThat you could call those people friends\nYou lie right to my face, expect me to believe it\nYou said you'd rather walk away\nThan let me fall to pieces\n\n(Chorus)\nBecause I knew it would fail, result in catastrophe\nA major betrayal would end in disaster\nYou're walking on water, strolling along as I drown\nDon't you see if you can hide this from me\nThen you deserve to be free\nAnd I can see it in your eyes\nAnd all I ever needed I lost in your hurt feeling\nAnd I can see it in your eyes\n\nAnd all the time that you say\nYou're tired of this place\nYou're so sick of my face, but I'm still waiting around on you\n...\n\n", 
        "If I said the wrong thing would you leave?\nThough my fingers may break, I just can't let you go\nDon't know why I believed you,\nNot with that promise you made me just yesterday\n\n(Chorus)\nI will always love you, take the me out of you\nA lot of people gonna be dissapointed when they find out,\nI love you and I need you\nTil my heart stops beating,\nI'll never lose this feeling\nA lot of people gonna be dissapointed when they find out\n\n3: 11 again\nThough I'm not your best friend,\nDon't you see that I will do anything to keep you with me\nClose your eyes, hold on tight, spin around, it's alright\n...\n\n", 
        "And tell me where we go from this point\nI didn't see him bring you down\nIt seems like yesterday I had seen you\nI tried so hard just to say your name\nAnd I'd rather die than disappoint you\nFor me to be free from me, I must be free from you\n\nRemember the times I sat on your lap\nThe way you'd always touch my knees\nIt seems like yesterday I was fading\nI feel your hands still touch my face\nAnd all I wanted from you was to love me\nFor me to be free from you, I must be free from...\n\n(Chorus)\nMe!\nBut now you fade away\nYou're all I was before\nBut now you fade away\nYour eyes I once adored\nBut now you fade away\n...\n\n", 
        "This happened once before\nSomeone just like you\nI let my guard down and got devastated\nIf you listen close, you might hear that sound\nI'm not sure but,\nI think it's my heart breaking\n\n(Chorus)\nSomeday, you will see\nI love the way you love me\nIn me, there's nothing good but you, yeah\nAnd when this ends, we'll feel so overrated\nOutdated, and never ashamed\n\nYou know I'll try to change\nI didn't mean to lie\nBut everything I am has fallen around me\nI feel short of breath\n...\n\n", 
        "I remember back in the day\nAnd all the memories I made with you\nAnd the smile on your face\nAnd everything that we've been through\nAnd I was always scared and amazed\nThat someone loved me the way that you do\nNo matter how things changed my heart ache comes in two\n\n(Chorus)\nAnd I wonder if you'll ever feel the same\nAnd I wonder if you'd be coming around again\n'Cause you made me run\nWhen I couldn't walk\nAnd you helped me sing\nWhen I couldn't talk\nYou gave me so much more when you\nYou had nothing left\nWhen I was dying, you became my breath\n\nHow can you trust me so much\n...\n\n", 
        "Hello, how are you?\nI think I'm fine, I've just been dying\nOut of touch, a little numb\nI'm always hurt but I'm surviving\n\nI was full of pride when I looked inside\nSometimes I'd like to laugh but I love to cry\nWith the words that you say, all the games that you play\nYou have always been the reason that I get this way\n\n(Chorus)\nYou taught me never to hesitate\nYou realized too late\nYou would need a super-hero to take my place\nAll the times you tried,\nNever thought you would lie\nWas it fun or was it more?\n\nNot today, not that way,\nThat's not the way that it should be\nOut of love, out of hate,\nOut of everything you could never be\n...\n\n", 
        "Not a lot of good can come from this\nAnd there's not much that you've shown\nWhile you were adding me up\nI never amounted much\nI'm just the person that needed you more\n\n(Chorus)\nDid you fall, did you break?\nDid you make a mistake?\nDid you lose how it felt to win?\nDon't tell me that it's over now\nIf I said the right thing, if I said the wrong\nIf I showed you my biggest scar\nWhere I once had a heart\nI'm sorry, but you're all that I know\n\nYou know that you don't compromise\nThe place you wanted to be\nWhen you were down on your luck\n...\n\n", 
        "She said I wonder when it'll be my day\n'Cause I'm not too far from breaking down\nAll I've got are screams inside\nBut somehow they come out in a smile\nAnd I'm wondering if I'll always feel this way, this way\n\nTell me about those nights you stayed awake\nTell me about those days you hated me\nTell me how you'd rather die alone\nThan being stuck here with me\nAnd maybe you've fallen down\nAnd maybe you just took the long way home\nBut baby you could never love you like me\nAnd one day this will fade away\nIn the mirror you'll see a smiling face\nAnd standing next to you will always be me, yeah me\n...\n\n", 
        "Title: Sadly Smiling Through\n\nYou're talking like you're leaving\nYou said it's your heart and not my call to\nMake you feel like feeling\nYou were so ashamed when I fell on my two feet again\nAnd God I hated your friends\nI gave you love they could never buy\nOr even try to understand\nThe part of me that it came from\nDon't you see that\n\n(Chorus)\nSadly I'm smiling through\nAll the truth that you took\nAnd the lies that you told me\nThere's nothing that I can do\nWith the promise you made\nThat you'd never remember\nNo coming back for you\nIt hurts so much to feel all this pain\nAnd so I haven't felt lately\n...\n\n", 
        "Well nothing hurts me\nLike seeing you hurt\nOr changed me\nLike the day you went away\nI know you said I was never there\nYou were always a good friend\nI don't talk about it\nI only cry when you don't see\nThough I walk around it? I felt I was to blame\nI never wanted to let you down\nBut I couldn't fake it\nAnd if you think it's better now\nSoon you will see, all the ways\nDid you walk in circles, hey?\nDid you hurt a little more that day?\nI know you said you would never wait\n...\n\n", 
        "And baby, maybe you've been saved\nAnd you just don't know it\nAnd maybe, maybe you've been hurt\nAnd you're scared to show it\n\nBut sometimes\nDoes your pain become too much for you to bear?\nAnd sometimes\nDo you run away?\n\nAnd I said maybe, maybe you won't stay\nAnd it doesn't matter\n'Cause lately, lately I have changed\nAnd I feel much better\n\nBut sometimes\nDoes your pain become too much for you to bear?\nAnd sometimes\nDo you run away?\n\nYou're gonna take this broken heart that he gave you\nAnd follow the light of the stars you love\nWhen every day is all the same\n...\n\n", 
        "I know it's not my place\nTo tell you what you're doing wrong\nSometimes I think about your face\nAnd there's times that I don't think of you at all\n\n(Chorus)\nSo tell me you need me and I will stay\nYou believe me and I will wait\nThat you'd come back for me every time I fall\nIn your heart there's just no place\nThere's no room to make a mistake\nAnd with one wrong turn you would never make it home\n\nI know you would never say\nWhat I did that made you feel so small\n...\n\n", 
        "(Verse 1)\nNow you're looking like you've lost your best friend\nThere's no use pretending\nThat you need no one to call your own\nWhen you're all alone\nAnd you're hiding out and you're feeling like\nYou've gone so far\nBut you made it no where\nAnd you're looking like you're blaming this on me, on me\n\n(Chorus)\nI don't wanna quit\nI never hurt like this\nYou said that you would love me\nBut you'd never commit\nMaybe this is it\nWhy do I feel like this?\nMaybe I got everything I deserve\n\n(Verse 2)\nNow you're looking like you finally know what you should have shown me\nBut you couldn't say that your heart was broke\nYou were scared, you were lonely\nBut your lip it shakes and the tears on your face\nYou thought you had it all until it fell to pieces\n...\n\n", 
        "Since you left me here I've realized\nI never see it from your view\nAnd since then I don't have much to give\nI hear I never meant that much to you, and I'm sorry...\n\nI close my eyes and it's just your face\nAnd on my heart I wrote your name\nI want you to be free, I want you to be free from me\n\n(Chorus)\nHear me laugh or see me smile but know inside my heart is breaking\nIt's been so long since I've seen your face and I'm not sure that I can make it\nThrough this life another day, with \"alone\" written on my label\nI wonder, did you feel the same?\n\nYou said that one day you'll have chance to love\nI guess I didn't get that choice\nAnd I know someone sings the song, the song of your heart\nI guess I didn't have the voice, and I'm sorry...\n...\n\n", 
        "I saw your headlights in the window\nMy face was pressed against the glass\nI waited for years for you to return before I learned\nThat you were never coming back\n\nI'm gonna close my eyes before I start to scream\n\nI'm dwelling on things I've never noticed\nYou won't save yourself, you'll never save me\nI only stumbled once for a moment, it was over\nI think I'll close my eyes before I start to scream\n\nYou said today's the day goodbye just won't wait\n\n(Chorus)\nAnd if you need me to, I'll wait until September\n...\n\n"
