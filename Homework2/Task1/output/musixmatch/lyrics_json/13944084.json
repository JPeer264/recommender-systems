Can't you taste it?\nOh yeah, I really wanna put a smile on your lips\nLike an eight grade kiss\nPut a swing in your hips, come on move like this\nLet's sing about the good times, good times, yeah\n\nI need some crowd participation\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
