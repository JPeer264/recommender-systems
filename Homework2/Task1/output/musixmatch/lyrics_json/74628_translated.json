        "I walk again through these darkened paths,\nAs the cold wind blows on my face\nAnd the fog creates sinister forms,\nThey guide me in the dark night\nA night as black as death\nAn iced hand closes my eyes\nAs the frost surrounds me with its obscure shroud\nNightfrost\n...\n\n", 
        "Nefarious nights, a time so far,\nancestral fears and nightmares\nFrom the darkened clouds of the past\nmemories of souls without rest...\n \nPray your lord to reach another dawn\n(The) Darkness takes away our mortal life\nThey' ve come back with these obscure nights\n \nThe moon appears through the fog\nwhich flattens over the bog\nLock yourself inside your fragile home\n...\n\n", 
        "(January '99)\n \nLet me die alone in darkness,\nshunned by the light\nMisanthropic death,\nignore the past life\n \nNo more visions of tomorrow\nDreaming the Death,\n...\n\n", 
        "On the path to darkness, the darkness of these nights\nThrough the fog we' re dressed with our black robes\nSilence... The wolves will lead us\ntowards the place of nightmares...\n \nA deserted house stands beyond the ancient cemetary\nWe coven inside the dark place\nThe pale walls of the crypt\nnow are lightened by black candles...\nThe medium begun the invocation...\n...\n\n", 
        "Piles of flesh buried by years.\nThe sands of time are covering our eyes.\nJaded by life. This nausea keeps going on growing.\nAborted visions of tomorrow.\n\nThese nights are endless.\nAnd the wind will bring us the coldness of depression.\n\nA life I cannot face.\nTheir voices fill this dark emptiness.\nDesolated vastlands. The broken wings of a fallen bird.\n...\n\n", 
        "Remembrances - Once more Im there\nLiving in the past\nFaded pictures of yesterday\nMy best and worst memories\nWill be forever here\n\nAnother night - Bleak fading lights\nIm growing old with them\n\nBurning grief consumates me\nIm falling to dust\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I watched into the burning sun.\nMy eyes filles with obsession.\nAn eternal walk towards nothing.\nAn empty road, as long as my eternal sickness.\n\nI watched into a dead horizon.\nMy blood falls into the sun.\nMy thoughts drown into emptiness.\nStench of death in the air.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Kill me - Take me to the place\nwhere my cries will stop forever\nAnd where my memories\nwill drown in the sickness of dusk\n\nThe shadows of the noose on the wall\ncrosses that of my neck\nThe weight of this sorrow\nThe need to end it now\n\n...\n\n", 
        "As a desolated subway\nAs an empty city street\nIt takes me a way\nTowards oceans of concrete\n\nA grey walk into the void\nThrough faceless humans\nNauseating melancholy\nSuburban distress\n\nLifeless as your jaded eyes...\n\nPitch black misery\n...\n\n", 
        "Die for me - I'll swallow all your pain \nKill me - Release me from this strain \nFeel it - You are going to be forgotten \nTaste it - The hand of unforgiveness \n\nI injure myself \nSearching for a way out \nIn my eyes you see \nThe horror of being alive \n\n...\n\n", 
        "Once again life is killing me\nThis time I know there's no way back\nLeft alone, abandoned\nWithout any chance in tomorrow\n\nYou're gone forever\nAs I try to find a reason for this\nEndlessly wondering why\nYou burned away all I was living for\n\nRemembrances are all I still own of you\nAs I lie in my bed, drunk, confused\nFlashes of our past passing before my eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "Thought I dreamed it again, the place where I constantly wander \nSo far and wrapped in darkness \nIt stands as the incarnation of my obsessions \n\nMy soul is keaving my body once more \nAs I enter those wretched ancient walls \nCorridors of post-mortem existence \n...\n\n", 
        "Froten and still I stand \nThrough these rooms of emptiness \nThe void in my hands once more \nAwaken to see another day of greyness \n\nArmless and numb \nAll emotions now are gone \nI burn another page \nFrom the book of my memories \n\n...\n\n", 
        "Gone was the logic Burned by despicable and contemptible lie They Caught by Logic Dead world, gave up hope, pray the world ..."
