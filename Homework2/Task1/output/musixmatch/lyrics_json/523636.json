        "The city lights don't shine for me\nI hope this glow is all I see\nThe stars are diving in\n\nWhy do you always see the worst in me?\n\nThere was a time when I was free\nShe showed me what it was to be\nThe quiet kids caught up with me\nSave your vessel\nRun for our lives to be the number one\nSave your vessel\nRun for our lives to be the number one\nWe let it slip away, there must have been another way\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
