        "Death\nClose my eyes\nStop my cries\nMisery\nSet me free\nHear me pray\nShow me the way\nTake me home\nNow it's done\n\nI'm a lonely sad spirit\nI'm near you, can you feel it?\nThe death has taking me\nAnd I roam for eternity\n\nI'm flying around mankind\nI can read in every mind\nThe escape, I want to find\nBut I'm so blind\n...\n\n", 
        "In the darkness I seek your sound To guide me to enlighten My horizon Such is life That gave me I have to wander in darkness for eternity I sometimes envy Other pleasures Small joys Reasons to live or to exist But I remain alone in my thoughts my world remains closed forever Listen to me Hear me This is my cry Who is calling you Take me Train me in these places Prohibited Take my hand Take my hand not my Guide in this life Take my life Take my soul this is my dream Who will light ...", 
        "The wings stuck with your blood on the pavement and on the day which enlightens your crushed specter. Sometimes you scare me, you make me see the dead at the bottom of the abyss, in the middle of the street you look like at this smooth sheet of paper as the sky, a beautiful summer day. But a little blood to your skin adhesive pad. And I&#39;m afraid, and I&#39;m cold, that&#39;s my death is your death I see. ...", 
        "Take my body I give you my flesh Take my soul I give you my life be without complex born in me the desire Brought by your hand alone Who understands me I likes your caresses Those that make me beautiful and that guide my steps Towards this place so dark Teach me to love in your long, fine fingers I want to taste your forbidden fruit A Without having invested pleasure rises in me I feel my end come yet I breathe ...", 
        "Day of wrath, that day Will dissolve the world in ashes, as foretold by David and the Sybil. What trembling there will be When the judge shall come to weigh everything strictly! ...", 
        "Valley of pain\nEach tree is a part\nOf sadness\n\nBehold deep rivers\nWhich are a drop\nOf a girl\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In my eyes\nI saw your face\nShining in my skin\n\nIn my eyes\nMy heart is crying\n...\n\n", 
        "Anathema fell on this poor humanity&#39;s dark world in sleep The moon hid the sun and the sky that covers As the arms which open Spreading the dark on our world be damned The dull sound of thunder as Asserts anger Forces of income night take life the men scream in pain and beg their creator at the Advanced face funeral in the grip of darkness cold grabbed These envelopes mutilated And our weak hearts weep flying their last on singing rivers sail the body from our dead brothers and now will slowly throw in the black seas of blood the earth spreads rotten odor from death to life that is dying from his smoldering graves in the cold, chilling the air distance bell Tolls What nobody will hear an announced end to ...", 
        "I&#39;m so alone and it is so cold here, the lakes of heaven keep me captive A cell from which light is banished, I am not a man here, I&#39;m an angel here. Since 1000 year I look at her face These frozen tears are now hers, Forbidden love I bear this woman, Me is now prisoner of darkness. I am now only a sad angel Alone love with the mother of humanity, How to understand the purity of my soul, but how a love so deep regret for this woman. ...", 
        "The ground slipped under my feet, I walk in the dark Last night marked the end, when I cry for eternity. It&#39;s this place called heaven, Who forsake me in the dark, it is the god who cursed me, Who fills me with despair. The monks of dark stones have me convicted of a crime, I could go through hell, to Mary, to see you again in the tops. ...", 
        "Sleep, sleep, little angel and dream of death, Sleep, sleep, little angel, tomorrow you will be dead, Sleep, sleep, little angel, tomorrow you will not live, sleep, sleep, little angel, tomorrow I&#39;ll be there, ...", 
        "I do not know what to do in this life, in this hell in paradise, I lost my wings and my freedom, because of the one I loved you so much, ice Tears are like hopes, ...", 
        "(Music by Arkdae, Lyrics by Hylgaryss) A light flickers in the night, the angel falls from heaven, wings torn by his God Another drop among the rains. His body has crossed the clouds To land on earth trembling, the one angel, there remains only the face, The purity of his white complexion. The poor man shall be sad But from Heaven came hatred, It remains, on his pale face, What Ignored miseries and sufferings. ...", 
        "Eternal sadness of an angel on earth, Large fountains of tears at infinity, black eyes this be laying the stone, a sculpture Fallen overnight. Hell gently touched our soil, but death is so tired, That even the paradise sorry, die for this empire of ice? Roses cover the tomb That shall be trodden melancholy angel ...", 
        "Deliver me, from eternal death, on that dreadful day, when the heavens are moved, they are, and the earth, as long as they do, to judge the world by fire, I am made to tremble and to fear, ...", 
        "Thousands of souls fall from the sky, and the lives and deaths are mixed, the earth opened up all over the cemetery, shaking crosses and tombs. The two armies are united by fire Amidst the mists and winds Doing so shook the world Destroying life and death stuffing. Bodies fall from the sky, from hot blood still dripping, as to nourish the earth, Hungry by so much hatred. ..."
