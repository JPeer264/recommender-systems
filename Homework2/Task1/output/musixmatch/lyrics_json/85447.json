        "It tapped me on the shoulder today when I got home\nI saw everything collecting dust\nIt made me hope there was something more\nI pour over pages, desperate to find out why\nThe cripple at your table has what I'm longing to find\n\nTeach me how to hum it\n'cause I don't know the words yet\n\nHelp me see the light\nI'm reaching through the fight\nYahweh, show me the Kingdom\nArms open wide\nDeath swallowed up by life\nYahweh, show me the Kingdom\n\nWhy are some women barren\n...\n\n", 
        "Why would I ever worship wood or stone?\nThings that cannot hear or speak at all\nWhy would I want something that I can control?\nWhen I can't even trust myself to fall\n\nI was following a cloud of fire and smoke\nBut my heart was too weak to understand\nSo I built an image with my fear and with my gold\nNow I'm reaching out for Your hand\n\nCome find me, come find me\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm on a flight home this morning\nAnd I can't help but stare at You\nMy face pressed against this little window\nThe sky explodes in praise to You, to You\nI know my words can't wrap their arms around You tight enough\nBut still I'll try in this simple song\nTo You, my Jesus\n\nBecause the more I fight it, the more I love You\nAs my eyes widen, I have to tell You\n\nThere's nothing like waking up\n...\n\n", 
        "Am I a hopeless case?\nYou keep saying the same things\nBut is it on my face?\nThat it isn't sinking in\nLike a homeless man tapping on a car window\nI feel so disconnected but so in need to hear this\nDo You still see:\n\nSomething there, Yeah, yeah, yeah\nSomething there, Yeah, yeah, yeah\n...\n\n",

        "I've written you a lot of songs\nThe kind you write on rainy days\nUnrequited love\nBut now I'm humming a different tune\nJust twelve hours ago\nI was sitting on a bench with you\n\nI've never heard of something that sweet\nBut are you sure you want me?\n\n...\n\n",
