        "Never before have I seen you look so blue\nI can't find a cure and nothing comforts you\nBut the light at the end of the tunnel\nDoesn't shine at the end of the day\n\nEvery time you cry\nSave up all your tears\nI will be your rainbow when it disappears\nWash away the pain\n'til you smile again\nI will be the laughter in your eyes\nEvery time you cry\n\nTime has a way of wounding what has healed\nWhat can I say? I know just how you feel\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
