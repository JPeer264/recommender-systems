        "The wheels of life keep turning.\nSpinning without control;\nThe wheels of the heart keep yearning.\nFor the sound of the singing soul.\nAnd nights are full with weeping.\nFor sins of the past we've sown;\nBut, tomorrow is ours for the keeping,\nTomorrow the future's shown.\n\nLift your eyes and see the glory.\nWhere the circle of life is drawn;\nSee the never-ending story,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I remember a meadow one morning in May.\nWith a sky full of dreams that sailed in that day.\nI was dancing through green waves of grass like the sea\nFor a moment in time I could feel I was free.\n\nThere are waves of forgiveness and waves of regret.\nAnd the first waves of true love I'll never forget.\nIn the meadow that morning as I wandered alone\nThere were green waves of yearning for life\nstill unknown.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;\nWhen troubles come and my heart burdened be;\nThen, I am still and wait here in the silence,\nUntil you come and sit awhile with me.\n\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;\nI am strong, when I am on your shoulders;\nYou raise me up' To more than I can be.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
