        "What's this written on the back of my hand?\nIt's a word I don't understand\nThe word, this word is \"you\"\nAll the things we had, unspoken\nNow lie upon the floor, all broken\nJust things, just things, and now nothing more\nOh, nothing more\n\nI'm not sure if I know you anymore\nI'm not so sure even if I want to\nI'm not sure if I owe you anymore\n...\n\n", 
        "Iin a cabaret mood\nAnd your cabaret shoes\nThe glare of lights is starting to become faded\nAnd you're dragging me down\nTo your gutter glitz world\nAnd your harbored, clipped words are starting to sound jaded\n\nWanna go\nGo to go-go world\nWanna go\nGo to go-go world\nWanna go\nGo to go-go world\nWanna go\nGo to go-go world\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In a body of second-hand clothes\nSecond-hand thoughts and dreams\nShe floats from the town bridge\nEver more down the stream\n\n...\n\n", 
        "And then she smiled\nJust for fraction of a little while\nAnd everything was warm again inside\nShe's got a sunshine smile\nThe kind that warms up the corners of my cold room\nShe's got a sunshine smile\nThe kind that makes you forget again\n\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I remember walking home with my father from the station\nHand in hand, and all alone in silent frustration\nAnd the words he said to me just drifted away in the wind\nLike this memory, like the photographs in my father's house\n\nI don't want to be faded skin\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm slowing down\nAs we go on\nAnd I'm slowing down\nAs we go on\nWe can hold on forever\nIf we just hold on together\nI'm slowing down\nI'm slowing down\n...\n\n", 
        "And then she smiled\nJust for fraction of a little while\nAnd everything was warm again inside\nShe's got a sunshine smile\nThe kind that warms up the corners of my cold room\nShe's got a sunshine smile\nThe kind that makes you forget again\n\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\n\n...\n\n", 
        "At the wheel of a car\nAt the wheel of a heart\nI gotta keep it on the road now\nI gotta keep it on the go now\n...\n\n", 
        "Everyone says love is lean these days\nAnd everyone pays for their dreams in some way\nI haven't got you, or dishonorable intentions\nAll I hold is a photograph of my magnificent obssession\n\nYou could purify me, make me true-to-form\n...\n\n", 
        "And then she smiled\nJust for fraction of a little while\nAnd everything was warm again inside\nShe's got a sunshine smile\nThe kind that warms up the corners of my cold room\nShe's got a sunshine smile\nThe kind that makes you forget again\n\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\nSunshine smile\n\n...\n\n",
