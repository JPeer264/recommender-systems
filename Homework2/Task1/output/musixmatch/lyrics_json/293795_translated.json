        "Back in my schooldays acting the fool days\nOne and one and one makes three\nAnd a man said: \"Kid, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time.\"\n\nArmour-clad horses, riding Trojan horses\nNever made sense to me\nI didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine\n\n\"Stop, pay the price,\" they said to me\nTake this advice. You're out of your head\n...\n\n", 
        "I got something\nYou never, never, never had before\nI got something\nI never, never, never gave away before\n\nNo other woman can give it to you\nNo other woman can do what I do\nNo other woman, no, no\nI got something\n\nI know you've been around man\nYou've had you shares of ups and downs\nBeen through to many lovers\n...\n\n", 
        "If you ever had the time\nYou would try to make it fine\nIf your promises were real\nThen maybe love is what I'd feel\nBut you seem to be so sad\nLike a fairytale gone bad\nAnd I don't know what to say\nBut I can't keep playing games\n\nI can't stay now, I can't stay now\n...\n\n",

        "Every little thing's been said about it\nHow does it apply to you\nMaybe I could learn to live without it\nWhere do you find\nOne of a kind\nPlaying for time\nThe way you do\n\nEvery other day I think about it\nDo you remember when\nYou said we'd never be without it\nWhere do you find\nOne of a kind\nPlaying for time\n...\n\n",

        "You give me love\nYou give me love\nYou give me love\nYou give me love\nYou give me\nIn the morning see you shine\nFeel your body moving mine\nThe twilight slowly turning\nI watch you walking away\nYou give me love, you make me shine\nClear in the midnight sky\nMy fantasy makes me shine\nClear in the midnight sky\nDon't let the sun go down\nDon't be fooled by the changes you see\nInterpretations vary once in a while\nDon't close the door on me\nIn the darkness see you shine\n...\n\n",
