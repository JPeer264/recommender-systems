        "Together again my tears have stopped falling\nThe long lonely nights are now at an end\nThe key to my heart you hold in your hand\nAnd nothing else matters 'cause we're together again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes\nWhen you take you got to give so live and let live or let go\nI beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden\nI could promise you things like big diamond rings\nBut you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover so you better think it over\nWhen it's sweet talking you could make it come true\n...\n\n", 
        "Take the ribbons from your hair shake it loose and let it fall\nLay it soft against my skin like the shadows on the wall\nCome and lay down by my side till the early morning light\nAll I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night\n...\n\n", 
        "(Your cheatin' heart will tell on you)\nYour cheatin' heart will make you weep\nYou'll cry and cry, you'll try to sleep\nBut sleep won't come the whole night through\nYour cheatin' heart will tell on you\n\nWhen tears come down like falling rain\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday, when I was young\nThe taste of life was sweet\nLike rain upon my tongue\nI teased at life as if\nIt were a foolish game\nThe way an evening breeze\nMay tease a candle flame\nThe thousand dreams I dreamed\nThe splendid things I planned\nI always built to last\nOn weak and shifting sand\nI lived by night and shunned\nThe naked light of day\nAnd only now I see\nHow the years have ran away\nYesterday, when I was young\nThere were so many songs\nThat waited to be sung\n...\n\n",

        "I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord\nSince my baby said goodbye\nLord I don't know what I'll do\nAll I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord\n\nThat last long day she said goodbye\nWell lord I thought I would cry\nShe'll do me, she'll do you\nShe's got that kind of lovin'\n\nLord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy\nSuch a beautiful dream\nI hate to think it's all over\nI've lost my heart it seems\n\nI've grown so used to you somehow\n...\n\n", 
        "(I can't help it if I'm still in love with you)\nToday I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet\nI can't help it if I'm still in love with you\nSomebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(Hank Williams)\n\nI've tried so hard my dear\nTo show that you're my every dream\nYet you're afraid each thing I do\nIs just some evil scheme\n\nA mem'ry from your lonesome past\nKeeps us so far apart\nWhy can't I free your debtful mind\n...\n\n", 
        "(She thinks I still care)\nJust because I asked a friend about her just because I spoke her name somewhere\nJust because I rang her number by mistake today she thinks I still care\nJust because I haunt the same old places\n...\n\n", 
        "The first Noel the angels did say\nWas to certain poor shepherds\nIn fields as they lay,\nIn fields where they lay\nKeeping their sheep\nOn a cold winter's night\nThat was so deep.\nNoel Noel Noel Noel!\nBorn is the King of Israel!\n\nThey looked up and saw a star\nShining in the East beyond them far,\nAnd to the earth it gave great light,\nAnd so it continued both day and night.\nNoel Noel Noel Noel!\nBorn is the King of Israel!\n\nAnd by the light of that same star\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie\nAbove thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by\nYet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light\nThe hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,\nthe little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.\nThe stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,\nThe little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "O come, all ye faithful,\nJoyful and triumphant,\nO come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!\nCome and behold Him,\nBorn the King of Angels!\nO come let us adore Him,\nO come let us adore Him,\nO come let us adore Him,\nChrist the Lord!\n\nGod of God,\nLight of Light,\nLo! He abhors not the Virgin's womb;\nVery God,\nBegotten, not created.\n...\n\n", 
        "It came upon the midnight clear,\nThat glorious song of old,\nFrom angels bending near the earth,\nTo touch their harps of gold:\n'Peace on the earth, good will to men,'\nFrom heav'n's all-gracious King.\nThe world in solemn stillness lay,\nTo hear the angels sing!\n\nYet with the woes of sin and strife\nThe world has suffered long,\nBeneath the angel strain have rolled\nTwo thousand years of wrong;\nAnd man, at war with man, hears not\nThe love song which they bring:\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been walkin' these streets so long\nSingin' the same old song\nI know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway\nWhere hustle's the name of the game\nAnd nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain\nThere's been a load of compromisin'\nOn the road to my horizon\n\nBut I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\nRiding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\n...\n\n", 
        "By the time I get to Phoenix\nShe'll be rising\nShe'll find the note I left hanging on her door\nShe'll laugh, when she reads the part that says I'm leaving\nCause I've left that girl, so many times before\n\nBy the time I make Albuquerque\n...\n\n", 
        "Livin' in the city\nAin't never been my idea of gettin' it on\nBut the job demands that you make new plans\nBefore your big chance is gone.\n\nYou get a house in the hills.\nYou're payin' everyone's bills\nAnd they tell you that you're gonna go far\nBut in the back of my mind,\nI hear it time after time,\nIs that who you really are?\n\nCountry boy, you got your feet in L.A.,\n...\n\n", 
        "Love is a rocket\nFocusing me to fly\n\nBlast off with me baby\nAll we need is the clear blue sky\nTake a look at my eyes\nLet me look at your eyes\n\nI'll take the window\nAnd you can take control\nSteer me up to heaven\nFar away from the fears i know\n\nLeave a trail of love smoke\nJust like a dusted road\n\nHouston look here i go again\n...\n\n", 
        "Southern nights\nHave you ever felt a Southern night\nFree as a breeze, not to mention the trees\nWhistling tunes that you know and love so\n\nSouthern nights\nJust as good even when you close your eyes\nI apologize to anyone who can truly say\nThat he has found a better way\n\nSouthern skies\n...\n\n", 
        "Looking back on the days when I was scuffling for a buck\nNot overly concerned with life and love\nI was always feeling sorry for myself and my bad luck\nI never stopped to think what life's made of\n\nWith my nose to the grindstone and my shoulder to the wheel\nI fought for my daily dollar like a man\nThen you came into my life and nothing else seemed real\nI found the answer right here in my hands\n\n...\n\n",
