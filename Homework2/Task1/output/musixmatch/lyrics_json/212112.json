        "Breaking down\nYour days are getting longer\nThere's a yellow glass dragon who's chasing you around\nSit your head on a silver jet stream while the smoke is rising over your thoughts and your dreams.\nWatch over you, you watch and fall down.\nYour nuts and bolts are all over the ground.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Sole alla valle\nE sole alla colli-i-na\nPer le campagne\nNon c'e' piu' nessuno\nAddio addio amore\nIo vado via\nAmara terra mia\nAmara e be-e-e-e-lla\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Oh here comes the river\nRising over your heads\nOver all of the thoughts that will burn you down\nOh here comes the river\nRising over your quiet heads\nOver the thing that you said you don't need anymore\nOver the lovers who forgot how to breathe\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "And I fall into the water and I'm little to the world\nAnd I swam around under and I wrapped my arms around\nUnder I drown there\nUntil I go there\n\nAnd I lost myself inside her\nAnd I made myself alone\nAnd these strange new surroundings came and stole my soul\nWhere did I go there?\nWhere did I go there?\n\nAnd now I'll start to breathe again\nUntil we start to drown\nNow we know, know, know\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I dont know if these are right i just listened to it ALOT and tried to figure them out\n\nHuracan\n\nCaught inside a hurricane\nTwisting through my brain\nWaiting for the moment that till sweep me from the ground\nCaught inside a hurricane\nBlowing every way\nWaiting for the moment that it'll take this world away\n\nAway from me\nAway from me\nAway from me\nAway from me...\n\nLife is wonderful\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
