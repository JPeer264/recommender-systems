        "I'll be remembered as the one\nWho never was afraid to fall\nYou said you would be able to crawl up\nYou fold your words to dreams\n\n\nNothing but an exaggeration of words you used to say\nFrom now on alone\n\n(I said stop starring)\n\n...\n\n",

Why is everything so far away?\n\n(Far away)\n\nEverything around me is fading away. Why cant you stay, hold me, break me free.\n\n(Everything i say and do is useless to me)\n...\n\n",

        "Another day passed by\nWhat made it different to all the others?\nYesterday's light was just as bright as the night.\nSwallow all the things that cause your world to fall apart.\n\n(Staring at the sky with no direction on your mind.)\n\nWith closed eyes we see how everything is dying inside.\n...\n\n", 
        "(The pitter-patter of tiny feet on the glass of our eyes\nMaking things so hard to see\nWipe the pain away, and then you see that the sun does shine\nAs you walk you notice you don't walk alone, this army is full of people\nPeople who've lost the will to live\nCan you help us now)\n\nWe have been watching the clocks collapse.\nA bridge that folds together and no longer lasts.\n...\n\n"
