        "The fishing boats go out across the evening water\nSmuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border\nThe wind whips up the waves so loud\nThe ghostman sails amoung the clouds\nTurns the rifles into silver\nOn the border\n\nOn my wall the colors of the maps are running\nFrom Africa the winds they talk of changes coming\nThe torches flare up in the night\nThe Hun that sets the farms alight\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I was making my way through the wasteland\nThe road into town passes through\nI was changing the radio stations\nWith my mind on you\nOh your friends call you \"Lily Paloma\"\nBut that's not the way that you are\nIt's too much of a gentle misnomer\nFor a shooting star\n\nBut you and me baby\nI saw you there\nStraight away I knew\nThere's really no hiding\nI'll tell you right now\nWhat we're gonna do\nWe'll go collecting the days\nPutting the moments away\nYou're on my mind like a\nSong on the Radio\n\nI remember the first time I saw you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Three mules came over a hill\nThey were dragging a cart\nCreaking, it seemed to be falling apart\nLaden with millions of dreams\nIt weighed more than they thought\nThey never noticed the wheels getting caught\nThey pulled on, staring ahead\nWith blinkered eyes and lowered heads\nHoping that all would be fine\nI see them now\nTime out of time\n\nRamsey and Stanley and Neville\nWere the names of the mules\nEach wore a bridle encrusted with jewels\nAnd though a murmur of voices\nWas rising behind\nEach laboured on\nAnd they paid it no mind\nThey pulled on with never a doubt\nPast boulders and holes\nTill the road petered out\nAnd giving a snort they sat down\nWaiting for somebody else to come round\nAnd from this are our lives writ large\nFrom the beach at Dunkirk\nTo Pickett's Charge\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "With your photographs of Kitty Hawk\nAnd the biplanes on your wall\nYou were always Amy Johnson\nFrom the time that you were small.\nNo schoolroom kept you grounded\nWhile your thoughts could get away\nYou were taking off in Tiger Moths\nYour wings against the brush-strokes of the day\nAre you there?\nOn the tarmac with the winter in your hair\nBy the empty hangar doors you stop and stare\nLeave the oil-drums behind you, they won't care\nOh, are you there?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "And I think of you now\nAs a dream that I had long ago\nIn a kingdom lost in time\n\nIn a forest of evening\nThe archer is bending a bow\nAnd I see you bring him bread and wine\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "The rain came down like beads\nBouncing on the noses of the\nPeople from the train\nA flock of salty ears\nSparkled in the traffic lights\nFeet squelched soggy leaves across the grain\nI took my love to Clifton in the rain\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "What if you reached the age of reason\nOnly to find there was no reprieve\nWould you still be a man for all seasons?\nOr would you just have to leave\nWe measure our days out\nIn steps of uncertainty\nNot turning to see how we've come\nAnd peer down the highway\nFrom here to eternity\n\nAnd reach out for love on the run\nWhile the man for all seasons\nIs lost behind the sun\n\nHenry Plantagenent still looks for someone\nTo bring good news in his hour of doubt\nWhile Thomas More waits in the Tower of London\nWatching the sands running out\nAnd measures the hours out\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Pandora comes today\nAs she dazzles and she dances\nYou find hope and lose yourself again\nShe never stays the same\nShe changes moods like summer thunder\nStill you look for sunlight through the rain.\nAnd when she laughs you see danger\nShe can be cold like a stranger\nAnd you try but you won't change her anyway\nAnd I can see how she makes it\nIt's a game and still you take it\nIt's a spell until you break it, you must stay\nAnd lose yourself again.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Before the phone hits the receiver\nYou're halfway to the door\nThe voice said 'get out while you can,\nThere's just ten minutes, nothing more'\nTime only for the essentials\nBetter gather them and run\nThe false name inside the passport,\nThe gold bars and the gun\nAnd once again they've come out of the past\nAnd though your mind is cool your heart is beating fast\nYou've been through it all before\nEach time you wish a little more that you could ask\n\nWhat do you want from me?\nWhat do you need from me?\nThere's no rest for the running man\nWhy can't you let him be?'\n\nIt's a long and twisting journey\nFrom the sweeping northern plains\nTo the outcrops of the jungle\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
