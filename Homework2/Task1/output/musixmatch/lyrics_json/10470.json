        "(Music by Nordavind '91)\n\nAhh, Dance through the cold shadows of Pan\nas tears fall from heaven...\nonce I had hold the rarest rose,\nBut, that is now forgotten with time...\n\nAmong the tree's I wandered,\nTo feel the embrace of etemal eclipse\nas my candle bums out,\n-And we must make the myths...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "[Music by Nordavind '91]\n\nOnce upon a midnight dreary. while I pondered, weak and weary\nover many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-...\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one, gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n...\n\n", 
        "From the ashes he returns\nThrough the seal of the dark\nHe looks upon the enchanting moon\nHis lips are dry\nAnd crave for human blood\n\nThrough all centuries\n...\n\n", 
        "He hung himself in the middle of the night\nFound dead in the morning bright light\nGot no more lithium\nGave up life\nThey say: you better give up now\nIts not worth the strife\nThe soul constipation\n...\n\n", 
        "The sweet smell of warm blood,\nIt fills the air\nYour fucking guts\nSplattered everywhere\n...\n\n", 
        "Blood, sweat and more blood\nLove turned to hate\nLight turned to dark\nAnd life turned to death\n\nBlood!\nThe old engine is still running\nCleansing!\n...\n\n", 
        "10 times the power\n10 times the pain\nHe rolls you over\nAnd rape what remains\n\nHe exists in every town\nHe is all around\nHe stab you where it hurts\n...\n\n", 
        "Weaklings,\nYou are not the only one\nDreamers,\nI wish you were all gone\n\nLosers of faith\nGrievers of the heart\nAll the purity of sin\nInner strength\n...\n\n", 
        "The cold hands were yours\nThe stiff face was yours\nBut you were not there\nThe eyes were yours, but they were closed\nAnd would not open\nThe rays of the distant sun were there\nThe moon on the hills white shoulder\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Come on dead man\nYou have slit your wrist\nBow down dead man\nAnd slit your wrist again\nCut! Cut!\n\nRazorblade baby\nKill yourself girl\nYou Christian women\nYou can't live like this\nNo! No!\n...\n\n", 
        "In this house that I built\nOf cold emotions\nThrough years of oppression\nThe suffering which I obey\nAn unbearable suffering\nThe rope\nThe strangulations\nThe whip\nTotal submission\n...\n\n", 
        "The trail I walk is haunted\nBy his blinding light\n\nSomewhere\nDown there\nFor eternities undefeated\nUnwanted\nUntouched\n...\n\n", 
        "In the night the forest lies cold\nLonging for the north wind to return\nHear the sad whisper of the wind\nBlackened clouds cover the crescent moon\nEvil lords ride the tempest wings\nCursed is the soil of the pathetic fools\nThe winds of mayhem have returned\n...\n\n",
