        "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of someone gently rapping, tapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door-\nOnly this, and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in a bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nPresently to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-\nMerely this, and nothing more.\"\n\nOut into the darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"-\nMerely this, and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n...\n\n",

        "Over hills and over meadows\nsee the crow fly, feel her shadow\nOver woods and over mountains\nsearching for a war\n\nHer wings embrace each strife and battle\nwhere swords they clash and chariots rattle\nseeking out the one whose time\nhas come to take the blade\n...\n\n", 
        "I hate I hate and I love you ... and like everything has to be done, but I do not know ... Why do I do this you may ask?", 
        "I wanna be a legionair\nI'm gonna shave off all my hair\nWalk real stupid, talk real loud\nI'm gonna make my mother proud\n...\n\n"
