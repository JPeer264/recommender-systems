        "In this chapter there's no reality, it's just a son\nEverybody's got no words, they just can't sing along\nI've been trying to figure out how this all really goes\nTrying to see fire so I can melt this awful snow\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI have a dream when the sky is blue\nAnd I'll be coming home to you\nAnd never hate the stars\n...\n\n", 
        "I wanna show you that my love is pure\nOh my baby see I ask for nothing more\nI wanna show you that my love is for real\nOh pretty girl what gave you the right to steal\nMy heart, it's in your hands\nOh your beauty occupies all of my land\nWell I am, yes sir, just a man in love\n\nNow that I've found you well I know I'm never ever alone\nNo need for letters, No need to call you on telephones\nYou occupy my mind every single day and night\nSpread like wild fire\nPeople tell me I'm a crazy fool\nIf I'm possessed then what is there to do\n...\n\n", 
        "I remember back, back in the day\nWhen the sunshine smiled as the children played, I say\nI remember when it was so pure\nHearing melodies through the bedroom door\nMaking beats in the basement\nTasting all the magic harmonies and flows that we were chasing\nTurning fantasies into realities\nOh we were lost in dreams\nWe had all the keys\nAnd now it seems we can't pick the lock\nKind of like a flat line, I need a shock\nWhat's behind the door\nAre we too scared to knock\nDid you pull the trigger\n...\n\n", 
        "As I walk on down\nI feel like a clown\nIn a circus of my own\nOh my cover is blown\nFeel like I got a heart made of tin\nI thought of you this morning\n\nWell I sleep into a state\nAs I awake\nWell I start to find\nThat I can't get your smoke out of my eyes\nI guess I lose\n...\n\n", 
        "I stand open, I stand chosen,\nI stand open, I stand chosen,\nYou see the trees, leaves, water, and the sea.\nThe earth and it's fire, our shift is a breeze(? not 100% sure)\nAstrology can you please reveal to me\nThe language of my heart and the visions that I see\nI follow maps to find my destination, to find,\nthe station where love is my sole occupation yes sir\nI'm holy open, no I told them of the stains on my eyes,\nnow I'm falling, hear my calling to the one in the sky\n...\n\n", 
        "I spark a match and watch the candle burn.\nThe wick runs out and then love takes it's turn.\nOn fallen angels and broken sounds, we will last past the final round.\nIt took awhile for you to find me. (find me.)\nBut I was hiding in the lime tree. (lime tree.)\nAbove the city in the rain cloud. (rain cloud.)\nI poked a hole and watched it drain out.\n(I watched it drain out, watched it drain out.)\nAnd parallel to the city streets. (ugh.)\nOur broken crowns beneath our feet.\nBut as we walk across the diamonds. (diamonds.)\nWe know that love is always shining. (shining.)\nSo save me love, save me all the time.\nI'll wash you down with a simple sip of wine.\n...\n\n", 
        "Taste this peace\nIt will make you weak in the knees\nMake you want to plant unity with all your apple seeds\nWe're going to mix a mixture to create a portrait picture\nOrganic natural visions that will taste real sweet\nTraveling bhodisattvas transform madness into an opera\nOh the sky is falling but there is plenty of room to breath\nA moonshine conspiracy the beauty it brings joy to me\nAll this untapped energy it makes me feel so free\n\nWith the stars out\nWe got everything that can save us\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I am down down down\nNo one around\nAnd in this town town town\nWell I can't hear a sound\nIt seems I'm always lost\nI'm never found\nOh I am down\nSo down\nHanging around\n\nIt seems my skies are always\nThey're always grey\nSo I stay inside\nI don't go out and play\nOh the flowers try to bloom in my heart\nOh they try\nBut they just can't start\nBecause it's just too dark\n\nThis song is not a joke\nWell I do not smoke\nI may have tried a couple times\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I woke up in a dream\nA girl I see\nWhat is the language of your poetry\nI love the way your tongue tells stories of the sea\nYou swallow all my diamonds spit them out as fantasies\nQueen bee\nLovely\n\nWell I hopped a couple of trains\nGuitar in hand\nSearching for your bee hive in another mystic land\n...\n\n", 
        "I sold my shoes\nFor a front row seat on the news\nWhere I fould all that I can say\nAnd I still got the blues\n\nAnd I picked up the blame\nAnd shaved my beard\nAnd I walked back into town\nWith nothing to fear\n\nWell I picked up my mess\nAnd put it in the ground\nI watered it down\nWaited for the seed to sprout,\nTo sprout\n\nSilence fills the air when it's raining\n...\n\n", 
        "Taste this peace\nIt will make you weak in the knees\nMake you want to plant unity with all your apple seeds\nWe're going to mix a mixture to create a portrait picture\nOrganic natural visions that will taste real sweet\nTraveling bhodisattvas transform madness into an opera\nOh the sky is falling but there is plenty of room to breath\nA moonshine conspiracy the beauty it brings joy to me\nAll this untapped energy it makes me feel so free\n\nWith the stars out\nWe got everything that can save us\n...\n\n", 
        "Puka shells and marley keeps me warm\nBeing alone helps me appreciate solitude\nDifferent music suites different moods\nMy attitude can change from rock to sweet blues\nI enjoy lemonade on a hot day\nListening to jazz in the middle of the day\nSurfing from dusk till dawn\nStaying up late and playing guitar\nWell nothing compares to the feelings that you give me\n...\n\n", 
        "I place my hands in mudra\nI'm sorry that they abuse ya\nI'll pray for the sky to break \nFor you to escape into a new one\nI still raise my flags while the soldiers load their mags\nWe need to stop the crys of the orphan callin for her dad\nLets clean the slate, it's never too late\n\nYou're leaving nothing for the youth\nJust the proof, of destruction\n\nThe doctors give the pills\nBut the pills don't have the will\nTo take the pain out of the brain\nThey just make the brain insane\nAnd still they distribute the poison\nIt kills the creative voices\nWhen will we finally silence all of these violent noises\nSo oh now, the source needs to be found\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Angel rays are here to stay\nWhen the sun smiles in my face\nI can't complain\nBut hey, I still miss you\n\nAnd when the mountains make me smile\nThey make me smile for quite sometime\nI know I'll be fine\nBut hey, I still miss you\n\nFor now, I haven't found\n...\n\n", 
        "Check it \n\nSee the day God let men shake hands \nAnd aloud women to give birth \nIs the day the devil stuck his flag in the ground \nDeclared it his turf \nAnd at night he goes to sleep \nBut without closing his eye lids \nLike a junky found dead \nUnder the docks of coney island \nAnd he promises to speak the truth \nThen he lies again \n\n(Chorus) \nAnd aw it's venomous yes, venomous yes \nAnd no but were talkin' bout the devil \n...\n\n", 
        "Lace up your shoes\nRight now\nIf you've got things to do\nPut your head in the clouds\nAnd so why\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I\nI can fly\nI can fly so very high\nBecause all of you guys\nAll of you guys set my heart on fire\nBurning love through out our empire\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's coming out the clouds again\nAnd I don't know where I've been\nI'm lost on this train\n\nDancing with the fireflies\nI've got nothing that I can hide\nI'm lost on this train\n\nIt's coming out the sky again\n...\n\n", 
        "The kids are insane\nSick in the brain\nLicking the same wounds\nWe sit with the same moon above us\nBut we're different from the others\n'Cause we share the same pain\nIt's mutual\nIt's beautiful\nAnd all of our tears and all of our fears\nThey all come in one form\nBut yet we think we're from a different storm\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I sold my shoes\nFor a front row seat on the moon\nI found all that I can save\nAnd I still got the blues\n\nI picked up the blade\nAnd shaved my beard\nAnd I walked back into town\nWith nothing to fear\n\nI picked up my mess\nAnd put it in the ground\nAnd I watered it down\nWaited for the seed to sprout\n\n...\n\n",

        "We got attracted like bees coming to the hive\nStir it up stir it up stir up that sweetness inside\nMama has been heating up that breakfast for quite some time it's time to swallow and show them we're not hollow\nThat we feel fine\nWe feel divine\nBhakti is on our side\nGrab the sun and the moonlight\nOh it's time to turn some heads\n...\n\n",

        "Too bad that love is blind\nBecause it took out both my knees\nNow all my restless nights are as bright as movie screens\nI spilt milk on all your dresses\nNow they're covered with stains\nI now hide under the covers and take a different name\n\nHe is in the face of all forgivers\nDust on the window sill and I shiver\n...\n\n", 
        "Cut my wings break me down\nMy faith is gone I've lost my crown\nAm I alive or is this a dream\nBecause the illusions are breaking at the seams\nWhat am I following why am I bothering\nI fell a victim to the trick and now I'm sick of all of it\nAll I got is this box of strings\nAm I really bringing anything\n\nWhy do I question love when it burns so deep inside my chest\nWhy do I live in fear when I always know that I'm under his blanket\nAre you a saint or just a man in a blanket\n\nCan you please fess up because I just can't take it\nI love you too much for it to be a lie\nJust give me proof say the news either way I'll cry and cry\n...\n\n",
