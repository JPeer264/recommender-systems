        "I was a young man back in the 1960s.\nYes, you made your own amusements then,\nFor going to the pictures;\nWell, the travel was hard, and I mean\nWe still used the wheel.\nBut you could sit down at your table\nAnd eat a real food meal.\n\nBut hey, you young people, well I just do not know,\nAnd I can't even understand you\nWhen you try to talk slow.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When the morning of your eyes comes waking through my shadows\nLeaving just a trace of twilight sleep,\nI whisper to the baby raindrops playing on my window,\nAnd tell them gently this is not the time that they should weep.\n\nFor somewhere in my mind there is a painting box,\nI have every color there it's true.\nJust lately when I look inside my painting box,\nI seem to pick the colors of you.\n\nMy Friday evening's foot-steps plodding dully through this black town,\n...\n\n", 
        "Since you got me here I see you're trying to steal my soul\nYou're army's trying so very hard to find for me a goal\nBut where's your quiet pastures where there's time for me to be\nNothing else but what I am that's what you seem scared to see\nYou cover up your emptiness with brick and noise and rush\nOh I can see and touch you but you don't owe reality much\n\nHave mercy I cry city you're all upon my mind\nSometimes I think you keep forgetting that you don't know me\n...\n\n", 
        "The bent twig of darkness\nGrows the petals of the morning;\nIt shows to them the birds singing\njust behind the dawning.\nCome dip into the cloud cream lapping;\nI can't keep my hand on the plough\nBecause it's dying.\n\nBut I will lay me down with my arms\n...\n\n", 
        "Nightfall, o river of night flow through me\nWashing the thoughts of the day on your waters away\nFor the morrow that dawns never knew me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Not with the lips of skin nor yet with the lips of dark snow\nBut let the white dove sing\nOf the body of life of the lover whose love is complete\nHold hands out to greet, let not the swan be brought low\n\nFor all that is moving, is moved by her hands\nShe is mirrored for ever in the life of the lands\nIn the building of thoughts in the shifting of sands\n\nLife, life remembering\n\nWell here you are now, O now you are here\nWell how has it been so far?\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby come tell me 'bout your tree-house\nAnd your candy-strped pet mouse\nAnd your car that has feet\nHey come tell me 'bout your eyebrows that meet\nAnd my baby won't you tell me 'bout your chilblains\nAnd your right eyeball's growing pains\nAnd your purple tractor that sings\nHey come tell me all of those things\n\nBut if you want to tell me some more\nThink you can\nOh babe tell me 'bout your lover man\n\n...\n\n", 
        "First girl I loved,\nTime has come I will sing you\nthis sad goodbye song,\nWhen I was seventeen, I used to know you.\n\nWell, I haven't seen you, now, since many is the short year,\nAnd the last time I seen you, you said you'd joined the\nChurch of Jesus.\nBut me, I remember your long red hair falling in our faces\nAs I kissed you.\n\nWell, I want you to know, we just had to grow;\nI want you to know, I just had to go.\n\nAnd you're probably married now, house and car and all,\nAnd you turned into a grownup, female, stranger.\nAnd if I was lying near you now,\n...\n\n", 
        "Gently Tender\n\n\nGently tender falls the rain,\nwashing clean the slate again;\nBut leave me please, behind my brain,\nthis light doesn't shadow on her\nShadows dancing through\nthe pink milk blankets,\nwhere my mind\nLay dreaming gently of my loving you.\nSometimes I think I was true, but then I loved the\nstone beneath my feet as much, usually.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, who can see in the eyes of fate?\nAll life alone in its chronic patterns.\nOh, swan, let me fly you\nTo the land of no winds blowing.\nI know nothing, and know that I know nothing;\nAll is in the eye, and in its blinks of seeing.\n\nSo just like the morning\nThe ghost of the following day.\nListen: Ory, cry, cry...\n...\n\n", 
        "White rabbit smile, white rabbit smile\ncry not so loud my lover frowns\nI'm a grown up lady from London town\nYet ever more he sang his sad song-\nsweet Alice is a long time gone\n\nOh Alice is gone, gone\nAlice is gone, gone\nsweet Alice is a long time gone\n\nshe was pretty, oh yes\n...\n\n", 
        "Who's that knocking on my door?\nCan't see no-one right now.\nGot my baby here by me,\ncan't stop, no, no, not now.\n\nOh, come a little closer to my breast,\nI'll tell you that you're the one I really love the best,\nand you don't have to worry about any of the rest,\n'cause everything's fine right now.\n...\n\n", 
        "sissie wouldn't believe when I told her the old man was gone\nthe one who lived all alone in the shack on the shore\nthat's so hard to find, so har to go past\nhe used to light our cigarettes and never tell anyone\nhe had blue tattoos and he'd tell us tall stories from the bottom of a rum glass\nhe's got things to see on the spanish main he's gone away for awhile\nhe's gone skullduggering on the spanish main he's gone away far away\n\nthought I heard sails creaking as the stars paled\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear that the emperor of china used to wear iron shoes with ease\nWe are the tablecloth and also the table also the fable of the dancing leaves\n\nThe new moon is rising the axe of the thunder is broken\nas never was not since the flood nor yet since the world began\nThe new moon is shining the angels are washing their windows\nAbove the years whose jumble sale goes spinning on below\nAsk the snail beneath the stone, ask the stone beneath the wall\n...\n\n", 
        "You get brighter every day and every time I see you\nScattered brightness in your way and you taught me how to love you\n\nAnd I know you belong to everybody but you can't deny that I'm you\nI know you belong to everybody but you can't deny that I'm you\nOh no, oh no\n\nIn the morning when I wake, I moor my boat and greet you\nHold your brightness in my eye and I wonder what does sleep do\nFor you get brighter every day and every time I see you\nScattered brightness in your way and you taught me how to love you\n\nAnd I know you belong to everybody but you can't deny that I'm you\nI know you belong to everybody but you can't deny that I'm you\nOh no, oh no\n\nOh wondrous light, light, light, lighter\nYou give all your brightness away and it only makes you brighter\n...\n\n", 
        "Winter was cold and the clothing was thin,\nBut the gentle shepherd calls the tune.\nOh, dear mother what shall I do?\nFirst please your eyes and then your ears, Jenny,\nExchanging love tokens, say goodnight.\n\nLay down, my dear sister,\nWon't you lay and take your rest?\nWon't you lay your head upon your saviour's breast?\nAnd I love you but Jesus loves you the best,\nAnd I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight,\nAnd I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nOne of these mornings bright and early and fine,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nNot a cricket, not a spirit going to shout me on,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nI go walking in the valley of the shadow of death,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nAnd his rod and his staff shall comfort me,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nOh John, the wine, he saw the sign,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nOh John, say, I seen a number of signs,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nTell A for the ark, that wonderful boat,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nYou know they built it on the land getting water to float,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nTell B for the beast at the ending of the wood,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nYou know it ate all the children when they wouldn't be good,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nI remember quite well, I remember quite well,\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nI was walking in Jerusalem just like John,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nGoodnight, goodnight.\nGoodnight, goodnight.\n\nWho would lose and who would bruise,\nOr who would live quite prettily?\nAnd who would love what comes along,\nAnd fill the air with joyous song?\n\nWho would go and who would come,\nOr who would simply linger?\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll sing you this October song,\nOh, there is no song before it.\nThe words and tune are none of my own,\nfor my joys and sorrows bore it.\n\nBeside the sea\nThe brambly briars in the still of evening,\nBirds fly out behind the sun,\nand with them I'll leavng.\n\nThe fallen leaves that jewel the ground,\nThey know the art of dying,\nAnd leave with joy their glad gold hearts,\n...\n\n", 
        "Ducks on a pond, ducks on a pond\nVery pretty swimming round\nThe lion and the unicorn journey very far\nThe answers are the question, sir\nThe lady soothes the lion's fur\nMeek as a lamb he follows her\nWherever angels are\nSing me something\n\nI asked the ice it would not say\nBut only cracked or moved away\nI thought I knew me yesterday\nWhoever sings this song\n\nDucks on a pond, ducks on a pond\nVery pretty swimming round\nGreetings on you kings in the sky\nWho'll buy me a mynah bird\nPlay me a magic word\nSpeak of hopes with thoughts absurd\nThoughts floating by\nLittle ducks, pretty birds\nClouds across the sky\nSing me something\n\nI asked the ice it would not say\nBut only cracked or moved away\nI thought I knew me yesterday\nWhoever sings this song\n...\n\n", 
        "Even the birds when they sing\nIt's not everything to them\n\nFiddle-head ferns and daffodils\nMade me want to play \nTo the puppies having their little breakfast\n\nSo I picked up six fine strings\nAnd I began to play\nWhat I thought that new\n...\n\n", 
        "The bent twig of darkness\nGrows the petals of the morning;\nIt shows to them the birds singing\njust behind the dawning.\nCome dip into the cloud cream lapping;\nI can't keep my hand on the plough\nBecause it's dying.\n\nBut I will lay me down with my arms\n...\n\n", 
        "Dust of the rivers does murmur and weep\nHard and sharp laughter that cuts to the bone\nAh, but every face within your face does show\nGoing gladly now to give himself his own\n\nAnd twelve yellow willows shall fellow the shallows\nSmall waves and thunder be my pillow\nUpon the gleaming water two swans that swim\nAnd every place shall be my native home\n\nThe east gate like a fortress dissolve it away\nThe west gate like a prison, oh, come break it down\nIsland, I remember, living here\nWandering beneath the empty skies\n\nIn time her hair grew long and swept the ground\nAnd seven blackbirds carried it out behind\nIt bore the holy imprint of her mind\nAs greenfoot slow, she moved among the seasons\n\nThe great man, the great man\nHistorians his memory\nArtists, his senses, thinkers, his brain\nLabourers, his growth, explorers, his limbs\n\nAnd soldiers his death each second\nAnd mystics his rebirth each second\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby come tell me 'bout your tree-house\nAnd your candy-strped pet mouse\nAnd your car that has feet\nHey come tell me 'bout your eyebrows that meet\nAnd my baby won't you tell me 'bout your chilblains\nAnd your right eyeball's growing pains\nAnd your purple tractor that sings\nHey come tell me all of those things\n\nBut if you want to tell me some more\nThink you can\nOh babe tell me 'bout your lover man\n\n...\n\n",
