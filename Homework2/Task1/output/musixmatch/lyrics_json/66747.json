        "Last night I had a lovely dream.\nI saw a big parade with ticker tape galore,\nAnd men were marching there\nThe like I'd never seen before.\n\nOh the bankers and the diplomats are going in the army.\nOh happy day! I'd give my pay to see them on parade,\nTheir paunches at attention and their striped pants at ease.\nThey've gotten patriotic and they're going overseas.\nWe'll have to do the best we can and bravely carry on,\nSo we'll just keep the laddies1 here to manage while they're gone.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
