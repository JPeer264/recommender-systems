        "Well, the rain keeps on coming down\nIt feels like a flood in my head\nAnd that road keeps on calling me\nScreaming to everything lying ahead\n\nAnd it's a winding road\nI've been walking for a long time\nI still don't know\nWhere it goes\n\nAnd it's a long way home\nI've been searching for a long time\nI still have hope\nI'm gonna find my way home\n\nAnd I can see a little house\nOn top of the hill\nAnd I can smell the ocean\nThe salt in the air\n\nAnd I can see you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
