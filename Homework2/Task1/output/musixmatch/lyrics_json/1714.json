        "Someone's falling down tonight\nWhile facing front you stand and scream for more\nThe room jumps hot and chucked aside\nThe empty cans teeter across the floor\nBut at the edge the girl who shows in every crowd\nAnd never seems to have enough\nIs tossed by waves of sound and up on music loud\nWhen all at once it gets too much\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I don't know but I won't be told\nThe streets of heaven are paved with gold\n\nI'm gonna stop looking over my shoulder to check what's right\nI'm gonna stop thinking it over and start tonight\nDo it fast or do it slow\nDo it once then let it go\n\nI don't know, I don't know\nI don't know but I won't be told\n\nYou're gonna stop looking over my shoulder to see what I'm at\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Living on Government hand-outs\nWater in the milk from a hole in the roof\nWhere the rain comes through\nWhat can you do? You can't move\n\nYou got tears from your little sister\nCrying cos she don't have a dress without a patch in\nFor the party to go\nAw, but you know she'll get by cos she's...\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "So somebody's told you how to be a man\nJust fuck 'em and leave 'em and score as many as you can\n\nBut always have someone who's close to your heart\nAnd if you want to keep her, keep her in the dark\n'Cause you love her, so you just can't tell her\nYet that's a lie and you know full well\n\nYou have to pay the price of admission\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Looking back it's funny that we never lied\nThat night we met when we were both alone\nWe knew at once that what we'd want was just that night\nKnew it couldn't be forever, cos we each told of another\nAnd then found something al our own\n\n(Chorus:)\nWe both agreed we felt the need that goes skin deep\nWe said up front that's all we'd want and so\nWe took the love that felt so good and had to be\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "They say our country's on the rocks and Britain is the greatest\nThey say the blacks get all the jobs, they say that they are lazy\nA nice girl won't let you have sex, enjoys it if you make her\nThe media all twist the facts, I read it in the paper\n\nStands to reason\nYou've heard it said so it has to be the truth\nFact or fiction, what's the difference, they say it's so\nBut think again, repeat mistakes and it's never gonna change\nAnd you never get the truth if you never ask yourself\nWhat do they know?\n\nThey say all cops are bastard thugs, they're all a bunch of racists\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "It was nothing like that in my day, not here in my town\nWe didn't get things all our way till we were full-grown\nNow they go into pubs, and you're gonna get mugged in my town\nSo you read about it every day, in the headlines\nHow they take and take and drive away, sex and late nights\nAnd it's gotta be wrong, because they're so young\n\nThey're only bits of kids, they're only bits of kids\nIt's always bits of kids today\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
