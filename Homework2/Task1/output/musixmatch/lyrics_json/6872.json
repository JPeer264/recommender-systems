        "It's not the same when I look in her eyes,\nThe magic's not there.\nAnd when I look I realise\nWhat we could have shared.\nI'm always gonna love you,\nIf loving means forever,\nI'm always gonna want you,\nI don't think I could ever\nJust forget the love we had.\nIt's not the same when she's here in my arms,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",

        "Loneliness is your only friend\nA broken heart that just won't mend is the price you pay.\nIt's hard to take when love grows old,\nThe days are long and the nights turn cold when it fades away.\n\nYou hope that she will change her mind\nBut the days drift on and on\nYou'll never know the reason why - she's gone.\n\nEmpty rooms - where we learn to live without love\nEmpty rooms - where we learn to live without love\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
