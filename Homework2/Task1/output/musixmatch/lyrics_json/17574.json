        "Our lives were like lines on a map\nYou could measure us by comparison\n\nShe found out if she took off her clothes\nShe could score men by embarrassment\n\nWe were nodding dogs in her company\nAnd she hitch hiked through houses\n...\n\n", 
        "Mirrorball\nYou lit every dark corner\nMade the air feel like it was dancing\nYour eyes like an old coloured vinyl\nWere hiding in grooves a smile\nLike a sweet aria\n\nI was searching for something divine\nAnd ended up making the mundane into my shrine\nAnd we all know\nA little but we're tricked by the same sense of wanting\nLike silence mistaken for knowing\n...\n\n", 
        "I watch you wait\nAt the bus stop with one eye\nOn your watch\nYou turn and say\nTo strangers there's not enough time\nFor one man in one life\nJust a flicker and then a breeze\nBreeze, breeze\n\nBut you sit there for hours\nWatching programmes you don't\nPlan to watch they just come on\n...\n\n", 
        "You waited for me\nOn the green grass behind the park\nI felt your breath\nOn the back of my neck\nFrom two hundred yards\n\nYou waited for me\nYou said you didn't\nI know you lied\nI've been watching you for hours\n\nI trusted you\n...\n\n", 
        "You only stop talking\nWhen you're sleeping\nThere's got to be something wrong\nWith your past\n\nI can't talk if I'm thinking\nI'm not gonna move so fast\n\nIs your life so exciting\nYou have to tell everyone you meet\nTry to make it so enticing\nYou wear your soul out to your feet\n\nAlways leave before them\nYou want them to think\nYou've got so much to do\n...\n\n", 
        "I? d pay good money to sort your head out\nTo blank out the screen\nTo take us back to simple pleasures and means\n\nIt? s a barbed little comment\nNot big enough for the outside to see\nBut that? s how you love it\nThat? s how you kept it between you and me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Fade into the distance\nPaler and paler and\nFade into the wallpaper\nSlowly when I don't look\nThe more that I will you\nThe less it hurts inside\nTime on my own is like cool fresh air\nAfter summer sunlight\n\nYou fade away\n...\n\n", 
        "I kissed the forehead of someone I loved\nThen went up to bed cause everything was spinning\nI could hardly stand up\n\nAnd I wanted him\nI wanted to tell him\n\nBut the next day he was gone\nAnd I felt like we'd talked on and on\n...\n\n", 
        "No one is going to hurt you\nIm the one who will protect you\nLet your walls down\nI wanna be around you\nI just don't want to surround you\nYou think everyone has got it in for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Fade into the distance, paler and paler\nFade into the wallpaper slowly when I don't look\nThe more that I will you, the less it hurts inside\nTime on my own is like cool fresh air\nAfter summer sunlight\nYou fade away beautifully dissolved\nAnd my profile is clear ready to be resolved\n...\n\n", 
        "You waited for me\nOn the green grass behind the park\nI felt your breath\nOn the back of my neck\nFrom two hundred yards\n\nYou waited for me\nYou said you didn't\nI know you lied\nI've been watching you for hours\n\nI trusted you\n...\n\n", 
        "Night came to me\nLike a tired movie star\nCrept up to me in the dark\nI heard it call\n\nYou're too tired to listen to me\nBut you'll miss me\nIf you sleep\nAnd what's a day\nWithout a night\nTo give it birth\n\n...\n\n", 
        "What am i doing here\nWhen i was brought in the world\nThrough blood and tears\n\nHow will it end\nHow will it end\n\nI'm not trying to be melodramic\nI try hard to think what i'm going to say\n'Cause i want to keep the friends that i've got\nWell i think i do anyway\n\nHow will it end\nHow will it end\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Show it to me one more time\nGive it a try say that you were wrong\nAnd I was right\n\nThere\u2019s no one to blame\nI\u2019d prefer it wasn\u2019t me\nI don\u2019t chase fools or make rules\nSaying you and me are meant to be\nNo, no, no, no, no ...\n\nSaid it in basic french\nI\u2019ve slept with someone\n...\n\n", 
        "Saw the future to the past\nSaw the silence that is now\nSoaked it up in a cloth\nHung it up with old rows\n\nSomething like that\nOh god it's all coming back\nSomething like that\nSomething like that\nSomething like that ...\n\nI was calm sure of things\n...\n\n", 
        "I caught your perfect smile\nAs I watched you sleep\nI saw your beautiful soul\nWhen I felt your heart beat\nYour body small your spirit deep\nWhat might have been just makes me weep\n\nLydia\nWhere have you been?\nDreams of you\n...\n\n", 
        "Lonely never a thought from you\nSimply only\nNothing to you\n\nI just wanted\nA slice of your life\n...\n\n", 
        "Ddogs been hanging 'round my door for three days\nBeen barking like they're talking\nIt's been raining for more than three days\nAnd still they're not moving\n\nI tasted her on your skin\nI didn't tell you\nYou tasted her in your mind\n...\n\n", 
        "Fade into the distance\nPaler and paler and\nFade into the wallpaper\nSlowly when I don't look\nThe more that I will you\nThe less it hurts inside\nTime on my own is like cool fresh air\nAfter summer sunlight\n\nYou fade away\n...\n\n", 
        "No one is going to hurt you\nI'm the one who will protect you\nLet your walls down\nI wanna be around you\nI just don't want to surround you\n\n...\n\n"
