        "Hey, I'm with you\nLet me just get you a light\nAnd if we'd thought to listen\nWe might have checked if the weather was right\n\nAnd I don't mind if you want to drive all day\n\nHey, it's rainin'\nI should have brought my coat\nAnd sometimes I could sell my soul\nJust to sit and watch you smoke\n\nAnd I don't mind if you want to break my heart\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Its been a long way down...\nFrom what I was then, to what I'm now.\nI was up there, and baby you were proud.\nYeah its been a long way down.\n\nYeah its been a slow road back.\nTo havin' nothing again, from having it.\nYou were mine babe, and we were right on track.\nYeah its been a slow road back.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Last night I dreamt of you\nYou stood right here in my room\nI could see you, I could feel you\n\nLast night I swear, it was you\nRight here in jeans and my old shoes\nI could see you, I could feel you\n\nSo like a princess in my arms\nBut I wake up and I find\n...\n\n", 
        "Well it might not be important to you now\nWhen the night is young and everyone's around\nAnd the music flows\nThrough your doped up Disney mind\n\nBut you'll be crying like a baby when it comes\nAnd you will try it anyway you can to find a place to run\n'Cause it ain't no fun in party town\nWhen loneliness comes crashing down\nYeah when loneliness comes crashing down\n\nYou'll be hurting in a way you can't explain\nAnd all those pretty things you love will look so vain\n...\n\n", 
        "Well the bus is pulling out\nAnd I guess I'd better go\nBefore I make a grave mistake and let my feelings show\nAnd twenty miles away\nShe waits alone for me\nBut when I try to picture her you're the one I see\n\nAnd in another situation I could put up a fight\nBut you will be my downfall tonight\n\nSo the night is coming down\n...\n\n", 
        "All the things you wrote about\nIn your secret book of doubt\nLet me hear you reading how you love me\n\nWhat it was you were thinking of\nWhen we were making love\nAm I supposed to forgive you 'cause you love me?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "With some girls it don't matter, who you hang with\nWith some girls it don't matter, how you talk\nAnd some girls they are easy to be yourself with\nBut the one girl that I want\nAin't easy to please with what I've got\n\nWith some girls it don't matter, where you're aiming\nWith some girls it don't matter, how you act\nAnd some girls they don't care, what car you came in\nBut the one girl that I want\nShe wants that one bit of geography I lack\n...\n\n", 
        "Cry. Cry out your eyes forever\nIt wont go away\nI. I'm just a dumb observer\nIt's so stupid what I say\n\nLike everyone else will do\nI'm gonna lie to you\nTell you that life is cruel\nBut someday you're gonna wake up\nWith sleep instead of teardrops in your eyes\n\nAn so\nNobody lives forever\nThe crassest of clich\u00e9s\n...\n\n"
