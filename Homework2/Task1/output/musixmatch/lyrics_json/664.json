        "And you open the door and you step inside\nWhere inside our hearts\nNow imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light\nThat's right, your pain\nThe pain itself is a white ball of healing light\nI don't think so\n\nThis is your life, good to the last drop\nDoesn't get any better than this\nThis is your life and it's ending one minute at a time\n\nThis isn't a seminar, this isn't a weekend retreat\nWhere you are now you can't even imagine\nWhat the bottom will be like\nOnly after disaster can we be resurrected\n\nIt's only after you've lost everything\nThat you're free to do anything\nNothing is static, everything is evolving\nEverything is falling apart\n\nThis is your life, this is your life\nThis is your life, this is your life\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
