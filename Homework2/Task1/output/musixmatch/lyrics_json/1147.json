        "Step back and watch the sweet thing\nBreaking everything she sees\nShe can take my darkest feeling\nTear it up, till I'm on me knees\nPlug into her electric cool\nWhere things bend and break and shake to the rule\n\nTalking fast couldn't tell me something\nI would shed my skin for you\nTalking fast on the edge of nothing\nI would break my back for you\nDon't know why, don't know why\nThings vaporise and rise to the sky\n\nAnd we tried so hard\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
