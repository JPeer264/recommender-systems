        "We were walking down the block when we thought the bomb went off\nAnd our hearts nearly stopped at the sound\nWhen we looked and we found that it hit some other crowd\nI was glad it wasn't us, yeah I was proud\n\nCause I fall and I break just as easy as an egg\nYeah, my shell isn't as hard as it seems\nWhen my insides gush out there's no telling what it's about\nWhen it'll stop, when it'll seed, when it'll bleed\n\nYeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home\n...\n\n",

        "I cried for you, what a waste of time\nI gave away into, oh my weaker side\nNow my heart's in two, 'cause I made you lie\nOh whoa, oh whoa\nOh whoa, oh whoa\n\nI go out for a while, always ends up in a dial\n'Cause I run out of the trust that I had when I was a child\nSo I make you into just another chip in my smile\n...\n\n",
