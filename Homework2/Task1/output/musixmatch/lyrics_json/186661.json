        "Used to live my life for you\nUntil my soul got tired\nDid all I was supposed to do\nI could fool a liar\n\n(Pre-chorus)\nThrew it all away\nThrough it all to find redemption\nGave it all away\nGave it all to who would listen\n\n(Chorus)\nThat's the price I paid\nFor being different\nAnd I walk this road alone\nThat's the price I paid\nFor being different\nI can call this life my own\n\nUsed to be a part of you\nUntil that part was taken\n...\n\n", 
        "I know you'll be there\nTo see the tables turning\nWake up tomorrow\nAnd watch the bridges burning\n\nI can see\nI can see it in your eyes\nI can feel\nI can feel it in my mind\nI don't care\nI don't care if you realize\nWhat you see\nWhat you see in my eyes\n\nI'm over me being under you\nI'm breaking free I'm breaking through\nI've overcome all I'm underneath\nI can finally stand\nI can finally breathe\n\nRemember when we\nFirst had the thought of living\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I lay in candlelight\nI'm drenched in shadows\nI need a way to get it right\nI lost my halo\nAll the sins for which I am to blame\nClosing in I've got to get away\n\n(Chorus)\nI'm going crazy\nJust thinking about the way\nI've missed you lately\nAnd I just have to say\nI know you're waiting\nBut I would never change\nI would never change\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've had enough, I'm taking you down\nTaking you down\n\nYou've been all up in my face\nOut of line and out of place\nBlurring views, distorting facts, every time I turn my back\n\nI'll make you know your position\nDon't talk, just shut up and listen\nNo way out, now you can't play dumb\nGet up get up and come get some\n\nI've had enough, I'm taking you down\nTaking you down\nI've had enough, I'm taking you down\nTaking you down\n...\n\n", 
        "I was supposed to be an image of your soul (every yesterday)\nBut I was born of another blinded faith (starting to push away)\nEvery fiber of my frame is like a flooded vein\nI got it all to gain if I keep letting it flow\nNever, not been on my own\nNever let this truth be shown,\nnot afraid to be alone and I'm just letting you know\n\n(Chorus)\nDon't tell me what's right or wrong\nthere's two sides to every story\nWhy can't we just get along,\n...\n\n", 
        "Now everything inside my life's become a mystery\nAnd all the things that I've\nheld dear have lost reality\nI cannot go I do not know if you are really here\nJust let me know\n\nI need a friend to depend on\nI need so much more\nAnother reason to live my life is knocking on my door\n\nCHORUS\n\nI need to know if I can go\nAll the way down and back again\n...\n\n", 
        "Stuck inside these same four walls I've seen for sixteen years\nI'm calling out and no one hears nothing is as it appears\nTime is gonna pass me by the days are getting short\nI feel my patience wearing thin waiting for this to begin\nLocked\nLocked inside the cage\nLocked\nLocked inside the cage\nWould you be there to let me out\nI can't take anymore\nJust let me out\nI can't take anymore\nChoking on my selfish pride it's hard to swallow down\n...\n\n", 
        "For all the times that I've done wrong\nYou've paid it all back twice to me\nWhy don't we just get along?\nThis life was built on unity\n\nOpen up, you won't change\nYou'll only stay\n'Cause you wont change (you'll never change)\nAnd I won't stay (I can't stay)\n\nIt's just another lie to make me believe\nIt's just another lie to make me believe in you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Chipping away the unity\nFor something we cannot foresee\nAn eye for and eye\nA tooth for a tooth\nTil all that's left is the fucking truth\n\nCHORUS\n\nBehind the walls of innocence\nEchoes the lies they hold within\nWe're losing even if we win\nWipe it away to start again\nstart again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to think that this was perfect\nAnd wish that it was never ending\nBut those days are gone forever\nIt's something I'm not missing\nThere's a force there's a voice, in my head\nTelling me to think\nAbout the times that you were cruel and mean\nAnd I don't care if you walk away\nI'm here to stay and you need to hear\n\nYou make me sick!\nBut I love what we're doing here\nYou make me sick!\nAnd I can't be the only one\n\nYou make me sick!\nBut I love what we're doing here\nYou make me sick!\nAnd I can't be the only one\n\nI have to take advantage, before the moment passes by\nIt's so hard to manage, the ups and downs of your life\n...\n\n",
