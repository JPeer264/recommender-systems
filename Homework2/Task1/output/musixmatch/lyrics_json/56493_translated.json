        "When the trees were silenced\nYggdrasil's children fell\nBloodstained leaves decaying\nAnd no one was left to tell\nThe tales of the gods, of fates\nAnd of the timeless worlds\nWisdom we people once knew\nOf the wonders of life\n...\n\n", 
        "They met on a hill one late autumn eve\nOh, noble and graceful both stood\nWith eyes so intense, their passion so fierce\nThe wildest flame burning inside\nHe was the son of a powerful Viking Jarl\nShe was a child blessed by Freya in all her ways\nSilently they watched the endless sea\n...\n\n",
