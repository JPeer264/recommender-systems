        "Sleigh bells ring are you listening?\nIn the lane snow is glistening\nA beautiful sight, we're happy tonight\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n\nSleigh bells ring are you listening?\nIn the lane snow is glistening\nA beautiful sight, we're happy tonight\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n\nGone away is the bluebird\nHere to stay is a new bird\nHe sings a love song as we go along\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n...\n\n", 
        "I was looking for the answer all the time\nAlways looking, never finding\nI was empty inside\nFalling into darkness\nNeeding the light to see\nReaching out for shelter\nThen He set me free\n...\n\n", 
        "Now, is the time\nThat we stand\nTogether as one\nA new life\nInside us will shine\nAs bright\nAs the sun\nLet's bring\nBring in the new\nAnd do\nAway with the old\nA new love\na new love that's true\n\nA love that's never cold\nA love that never dies\n...\n\n", 
        "Time seemed to pass me by\nI found myself alone, wondering why\nThen you came into my life\nAnd gave your love to me\nYou are the one\nThat showed me the way\n\nIn my heart you'll stay\n...\n\n", 
        "I\u2019ve been running nowhere street\nI\u2019ve got to mend my bloody feet\nI\u2019ve thrown away ten thousand days\nI\u2019ve hidden black and white and painted gray\n\nIn my weakness, out of pride\nI failed to see the other side\nIt\u2019s a lost and broken war\nThat I won\u2019t fight for anymore\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(Verse 1)\n\nWe\u2019ve been on the outside looking in before\nWe\u2019ve lived on the inside with a closed locked door\nWe\u2019ve slept in the corners of the open floor\n\nWe go round and round and round and round and round and round and round\n\n(Chorus)\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Now if you\u2019re feelin\u2019 kinda low \u2018bout the dues you\u2019ve been paying\nFuture\u2019s coming much too slow\nAnd you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin\u2019\nCan\u2019t decide on which way to go\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n(Chorus)\n\nI understand about indecision\nBut I don\u2019t care if I get behind\nPeople livin\u2019 in competition\nAll I want is to have my peace of mind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Listen, birds don\u2019t sing anymore\nWaves don\u2019t crash on the shore\n'Cause You don\u2019t love me anymore\nSee, the morning sun doesn\u2019t shine\nAnd the moon\u2019s nowhere to find\n'Cause You don\u2019t love me anymore\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThen I realize - I\u2019m Alive, I\u2019ll survive\nI was only dreaming that our love died\nI\u2019m Alive, I\u2019ll survive\n...\n\n", 
        "Ten years ago\nI know I loved You so\nRight here, Right now\nI just don\u2019t know\n\nI\u2019ve tried, I\u2019ve lied\nI\u2019ve told the truth at times\nI\u2019ve laughed, I\u2019ve cried\nI\u2019ve slept with open blinds\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n...\n\n", 
        "Saturday night's a lie, I follow every cue\nSunday is sanctified, I smile and take the pew\nMonday it\u2019s back to school - Am I learning, not at all\nTuesday and Wednesday, Thursday, Friday I just crawl\n\n(Chorus)\n\nGotta fight, gotta stop living a lie\nGotta fall, gotta lay down and die\n...\n\n", 
        "Love saves the soul\nHate kills the heart\nFear robs the goal\nHope gives a start\n\nForgiveness is a gift\nBitterness a chain\nThe ugliness we sift\nHis beauty still remains\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWhen we all reach Heaven\n...\n\n", 
        "I Believe in You and You believe in me\nI Believe in Love and Love believes in me\nI Believe in faith and hope and destiny\nI Believe\n\nI Believe in Life and Life believes in me\nI Believe in God and what He sees in me\nI Believe there\u2019s more to life eternally\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If I see You standing, one hundred stars away\nIt feels as though You're touching me\nIf I am landing, with a stormy night delay\nIt\u2019s You I want, it\u2019s You I need\n\nWhen I\u2019m lost I close my eyes\nAnd suddenly I\u2019m home\n\n(Chorus)\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I woke up at six a.m., and took a look at me\nAll I was, all I am, I refuse to be\nWithin a simple breath, I taste my destiny\nBefore I lose what\u2019s left, I want my heart to see\n\n(Chorus)\n\nLove is why I live, Love is why I die\nIt\u2019s what I give, and yet what I deny\n...\n\n", 
        "SOLDIERS UNDER COMMAND\nVerse 1\nWe are the soldiers under God's command\nWe hold His two-edged sword within our hands\nWe're not ashamed to stand up for what's right\nWe win without sin, it's not by our might\nAnd we're fighting all the sin\n...\n\n", 
        "We're gonna rock and have a good time\nTonight's the night, the night we move\nTogether we will stand to rock the land\nWe're gonna rock for something new\nWe're gonna rock for something true\n...\n\n", 
        "Clap your hands and stomp your feet\nAll you girls and all you guys\nLet's rock the world with a new beat\nC'mon don't wait\nDon't you pass it by\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Verse 1\nShe waits alone, oh every night\nTears are in her eyes\nShe has lost all the love she had\n\nVerse 2\nShe lived her life for Him each day\nShe threw it all away\nTo live for herself - live her life her way\n\nChorus\nThere is no love like the love of your first love\nIt's so true\n...\n\n", 
        "Verse 1\nThey say that rock and roll is strong\nBut God's the rock that makes us roll\nDon't need no drugs to help us push on\nWe've got his power in our souls\nBridge\nStand up and fight\n...\n\n", 
        "I was looking for the answer all the time\nAlways looking, never finding\nI was empty inside\nFalling into darkness\nNeeding the light to see\nReaching out for shelter\nThen He set me free\n...\n\n", 
        "Verse 1 She says she tries so hard to show it\nShe wants to say whats on her mind\nSeems like he doesn't want to know it\nShe says he's always so unkind\n\nBridge But, she's not giving up\nUntil he sees\nHer love inside is heavenly\n\nChorus I love you, I want you\nBut that wont change the way I feel\nI love you, I want you\n...\n\n", 
        "Now, is the time\nThat we stand\nTogether as one\nA new life\nInside us will shine\nAs bright\nAs the sun\nLet's bring\nBring in the new\nAnd do\nAway with the old\nA new love\na new love that's true\n\nA love that's never cold\nA love that never dies\n...\n\n", 
        "\nSinging out in harmony\nIt explains so well\nWhat we're called to do\nWant to rock so you can see\nWe can rock as well\nRock as well for you\n\nBridge You can have it all tonight\nPick it up and make it right\n...\n\n", 
        "Mine eyes have seen the glory\nOf the coming of the Lord\nHe is trampling out the vintage\nWhere the grapes of wrath are stored\n...\n\n"
