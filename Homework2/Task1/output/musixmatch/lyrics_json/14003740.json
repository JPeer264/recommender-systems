        "It's easy to fall in love\nIt's easy to fall in love with you\n\nIt's easy to fall in love\nIt's easy to fall in love with you\n\nYou go outside dressed like that\nYou knew what was going to happen didn't you\nYou talk to me like that\nYou knew I was slowly falling in love with you\n\nAnd I... ooh\n\nAnd I... ooh\n\nYou know it's your neglect\n...\n\n", 
        "My eyes were tinted blue,\nWhen I thought I knew\nThis was not just a night\nIt would never get bright again\nSo I'll tip-toe around you my friend\n\nAnd the wind was crisp and clear\nAn I thought I could hear in the voice of the season\nIt gave me no reason to go\n...\n\n", 
        "My love took me down to the river to silence me\nAnd when he left I could not speak\nI lay on the ground\nI tried to scream\nBut no sound did come out\nI could only bleed, oooh\n\nI waited for him til the frost did come\nMy skin, it turned blue and my body was numb\nBut my heart it burned out til it was no more\nStill I wait on the ground\nI don't know what for\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a crash I wait for the impact\nAnd like a train I wait for the smoke\nLike a storm I wait for the silence\nAnd like a bluff I wait till you fold\n\nOooh there\u2019s a gun in the attic let me go grab it\nOooh I\u2019d blow holes in my soul just so you can look past it\nOooh ye there\u2019s glass on the floor there\u2019s a hole in the roof\n...\n\n"
