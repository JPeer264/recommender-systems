        "The people poured their concrete floors\nAnd built their churches and their walls\nThey painted pictures of their hopes and fears on them\n\nA single look, a tiny touch can change the system, it's enough\nAnd I can see it all in you love\n\nAnd your eyes explode with light, explode with light\nI'm covered in your light\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "What you see you must not touch, what you see\nWhat you want you cannot have, what you want\nAs Adam plucked the apple from the tree he never realised\nA chemical and biological attraction, came to be\n\nConsummate, your one desire\nPhysically connect as one\nTo copulate, will quench the fire\nBurning fiercely in the soul and mind\n\nWhat you want\nYou know you can't touch\nWhat you see\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
