        "Do not break his dream, that you do not lose your trust in friendship rakhetara that many of you do not believe in acting with karetara that loves you so much. ...", 
        "Night and stars above that shine so bright\nThe myst'ry of their fading light\nThat shines upon our caravan\n\nSleep upon my shoulder as we creep\n...\n\n", 
        "You went away\nI let you\nWe broke the ties that bind\nI wanted to forget you\nAnd leave the past behind\nStill, the magic of the night I met you\nSeems to stay forever in my mind\n\nThe sky was blue\nAnd high above\nThe moon was new\nAnd so was love\nThis eager heart of mine was singing\nLover where can you be\n\nYou came at last\nLove had its day\n...\n\n", 
        "I want to take you to a little room\nA little room where all the roses bloom\nI want to lead you into Nature's hall\nWhere ev'ry year the roses give a ball\nThey have an orchestra up in the trees\nFor their musicians are the birds and bees\nAnd they will sing us a song\nAs we are strolling along\n\nIn sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing\nWhere the honey bees are \"A-Maying\"\nThere all the roses are swaying\n...\n\n"
