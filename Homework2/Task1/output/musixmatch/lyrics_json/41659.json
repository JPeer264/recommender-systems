        "Money cannot buy\nAll the love that's here tonight\nAll the love that's here tonight\nOuh-ouh\nIt's just you and I\nSo lift your hands toward the sky\nLift your hands toward the sky\nOuh-ouh\n\nIt seems like yesterday that I was nothin'\nThen all of a sudden I'm a volcanic eruption\nThen all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion\nAnd I'm all up in your face yellin': \"Bitch, you can tell me nothin'.\"\nCause I came from the bottom, now everybody's watchin'\nI said it was my time, now I'm who everybody's clockin'\nAnd I'm just out here sprintin', I'm runnin' right through my vision\nI'm trying to outrun my past, but still trying to defeat my limits\nCause you only get one moment in this life to be great\nAnd you can give it your all despite what it takes\nAnd you never let 'em kill you, you take everything they give you\nAnd throw it right fuckin' at 'em and tell 'em it doesn't build you\nAnd no it don't ever break you, and no it can't overtake you\nLife's like a bed of roses, you take the thorns and you make do\nSometimes you have to hurt for the cause to be reached\nBut one day you'll be stronger than all that you beat\nAnd you can say\n\nMoney cannot buy\nAll the love that's here tonight\nAll the love that's here tonight\nOuh-ouh\nIt's just you and I\nSo lift your hands toward the sky\nLift your hands toward the sky\nOuh-ouh\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
