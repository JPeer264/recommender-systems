        "So Glad I hung up the phone\nMy best friend called and told me not to go\nI'd just get my heart broke one more time.\nI Walked in and there you were\nLooking better than I ever remembered\nSmiling that smile like nothing ever happened.\nYou were never not mine.\n\nCrazy.\nI know, I know, I know, I know, I know\n\nAin't that the way it goes\nAlways stumbling into something\nLifes an open road you've got to take\nIf you just let go\nLose your way to find that one thing\nThat you've been missing.\nYou almost missed it all.\n\nSo glad I turned around\nI know where I'd be right now\nSomewhere downtown thinkin' about what could have been\nand love would never be again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You said I'd never regret\nHaving you lying here in my bed\nYou told me that a love like this\nDon't come along but once in a lifetime\n\nYou said a lot of things\nYou said a lot of things\nYou said it just like that\nYou said a lot of things that you can't take back\n\nYou swore to me on your mama's grave\nA promise was a promise and it couldn't be broken\nYou told me 'til your dying day\nYou say what you mean and you mean what you say now\n\nYou said a lot of things\n...\n\n", 
        "Every time I had a problem\nDidn't know what I should do\nSinging oh oh\nI would run to you\nYou were there to guide me\nAlways there to pull me through\nSinging oh oh\nI would run to you\nRun to you uuuu\n\nBut I'm\nTired of walking in your shadow\nSo by this time tomorrow\nI'll be on a plane singing\nI never meant to hurt you\nYou know how much I love you\n...\n\n"
