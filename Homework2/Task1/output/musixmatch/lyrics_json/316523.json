        "Well I left on a line with the hope I'd find (??)\nMy riches in the hills of the Dogtown Mines\nI planned to return in a few months' time\nSo when will you meet me as my bride?\nBut misfortunes fell down like a cold dark cloud\nAnd all the road signs kept me rollin' further south\nI broke down, cold, hungry I rode\nStill it's only you I long to hold\nSo I'm puttin' my luck to the test\nI'm bringin' the eastern seaboard's best\nWe'll be makin' it up someday\nLosin' time along the way\n\nWith all the heartache and lost souls that pushed me\nThe debts and devils in me\nAlways lookin' for the next wind to take me out\nThrough broken towns from the gold rush days\nFaceless cities all set 'blaze\nBut in the darkest alleyways\nIs where I'll keep you pressed up to my heart\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
