        "We have been waiting for you, anticipating you\nWe shall not lose faith in all that is heaven\nAnd heaven is such a small place\n\nSeconds to minutes to hours to days\nScreaming for something that's something I will never hold\n...\n\n", 
        "Over time desire shall fall and lie and fade\nAwait unequalled thought and virtuosity\nDesire lies in wait, a precious cup, a stone or some such\nAbsent moments, ones which raised the heart to stand so great\n\nCannot choose not to deny\nBlame falls easy silently\nDarkness preferable, comfort found again\nIn solitude, a door into an empty room\nA door to familiar desolation\nThe spoils of past years lost for reason\nLost for some notions of new days\n\nInside there is gentleness\nCalm preceding tears\nCry again, cry again\nMoment of toil\n...\n\n",

        "In a face a view, through eyes this world collides\nI am voiceless in my angst\nAnd nothing can take us back to innocence\nShort, sharp, bloodlust reality\nIn despair I reach for night\n\nIn water purity reigns to be resolute\nAnd as a land we clean our minds, reap our belongings\nSew our angers and our strengths\nAll too obsessed by weakness\nWe have brought ourselves to meaninglessness\n\nSo easy to control, bring to harm\nA gathering of fools unjustified, on a mountain\nAnd I collect my thoughts\nAnd I rise above all that despises me\n...\n\n", 
        "Put your hand into my hand\nPut your head against my head\nPut your lips against my lips\nPut self consciousness aside\n\nNo redemption\nNo confessions\nNo distractions\nNo possessions\nLet your blood run through my veins\nBlade shall numb you from the pain\n\nNo tomorrows\nJust submittance\nNo remorse of self indulgence\nJust your body\nJust your body\nJust your body\nJust your body\nJust your body on my body\nWant your thoughts of me inside\nLet your hands run on my skin\n\nLet me be the one you need\nI shall be the one you feed\n...\n\n", 
        "Who can be against us? Statute and order ...", 
        "Thus to holy war, our songs that turned to roar\nOnward in our cause, we judged by holy laws\nHailed the sacred creed, fell on bended knee\nDeath that filled our wake, blood that stained our hands\n\nThus we reached the land, sacred man beheld\nVessel of a sin, none shall call him King\n...\n\n",
