        "There's a house somewhere i know where's the fire's burn all night long\nThere's a swing outside on the porch where i feel i could rock away the dusk until the dawn\nAnd even though the wind may be howlin'\nStars are bright and they push me on and on\nThere's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies\nThere's a cold wind blowing across the great divide\n...\n\n", 
        "He cracks a wicked smile and his foot pressed to the floor\nFlyin' down country roads that he's been down before\nOne of just three men that the sheriff cannot catch\nAnd he's travelin' 90 miles down the Bolton Stretch\n\nThe first time we had seen his face was back in '84\nHe walked right into old O'Hares, he robbed that liquor store\nThe sheriff tried to catch him but the man he got away\nAnd he didn't show his face in town again until today\n...\n\n", 
        "Divorcee goes to the bars\nA sophisticat pulls up in his car\nA hopeful youth waits for the first star to come out\nThe sky above can be so mean, the clouds cover what should be seen\nAnd there ain't much left to keen in my book\n\nHangin' on to someone else, he tells you that peace sells\nAnd you see him like all's well, I ain't jealous\nThough you used to listen to me,\nMy inner thoughts have made you flee\nI know you were just tryin' to be what you want to be\n\nI let you in to see me for real\nAnd you walked right out that's what I feel\nYou said you needed time to be alone\n\nChorus:\nAnd like the youth I looked above\nFeeling stranded without love\nThe time was wrong, and you left me in a hole\n...\n\n", 
        "There was a soldier, there was a lady, there was a lover, who live in town\nThere was a battle, in that far country, to that dark land was that old soldier bound\nHe held his true love, he kissed her softly, said? Darlin? fear not, I? ll come back around?\nFrom a rear window, the lover watching? watching as her tears fell to the ground\nThe nights grew cold, her heart grew lonely, along the streets she would walk and she? cry\nHer heart was tender, her thoughts went yonder, she? d gently kiss the ring she? d wear upon her finger\n\nDistance makes the heart grow fonder\n...\n\n", 
        "A man stood in the shadows his face was dripping sweat\nHe took a break from running but he wasn't done yet\nLooked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds\nDug his feet into the earth and headed out of town\n\nThe town line's far away and\nHe won't sleep for days\nBecause he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife\nNow the sheriff's men have got him running for his life\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Because your reasons are as cool as ice\nAnd your mind somehow paid the price\nYou'll pay it again--somewhere--on down the line\nWhen you're there I'm sure you'll stare\nAnd I'll be behind you\n\nBecause your day is a clock of grey hours\nAnd your smile has those tallest powers\nBut sometimes, Jezebelle, it shines like the sun\n...\n\n", 
        "It's a cold, cold moon out tonight\nAnd it's a cold, cold point on your knife\nCould I call myself a man if I left by the morning light?\n\nAnd I'd be 40 miles from Denver when you woke up all alone\nI'd be 40 miles from Denver and three days from my home\nIn that cool mountain air, on an Appalachian trail\nOhh, life is better there\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Once I had a sweetheart and our love was fair\nI remember her brown eyes and her long, dark hair\nI remember summer nights down at the fishin' hole\nRollin' around in the tall grass and the sweet lies we told\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "I thought I saw you on the street today\nthere were no one there just an empty lane.\nI was dreaming, dreaming.\nI turned around like I never cared\ncause I'm proud enough, and I ain't scared.\nI'm not lying, lying.\n\nAs the night comes along\nI just have to be strong\nI can make it alone.\n\nSo tell me why do I bleed this way.\nSo tell me why my life has gone astray.\nOh tell me why there's no turning back.\nNothing left to say at the end of the day.\n\n...\n\n",
