        "The feeble leafs decline,\nEnshrined in downing deep\nThe mourn abandoned plains,\nLaid down in sombre sleep\nMisty shades engulf the sky\nLike past, worn memories\nThe bird's song fills the whispering breeze\nWith autumns melody\n\nThe lunar pale grim shape\nAt evening's sight renews\n...\n\n", 
        "Sengi amoris \nA mere passions fraud disgraced and to disgrace,\nIn pacis quentis, \nWith bewitched charm seduced my every days\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The leafs and I entangled dance a harmonie \nI dare not stain with vain delight\nAnd thus embraced we roam the passing eve like a\nPillgrim who craves a shelters guiding light\nI question thee, beloved night to calm my joy \nSo that I not like the weary leaves be strewed\nFor I submitt to thy solitary grace (as) even springs\nLife is by winters gaze subdued\n\nLost in a dream I beheld a maiden dance\nAnd when she sat down by a sliver stream\nPlunging her feet in the shallow waves\n...\n\n", 
        "Many a weary night endured\nSince the utter charm of joy has pured\nMy unquiet dreams, my misery\nHow sweat if I could share with thee\nUnable to endure it's smile\nWhich kindly eased my sombre veil\n...\n\n", 
        "Unveil yours eyes, see the special moon gone\nLeaving not a single ray of joy to rest upon\nFeast on those that crave thy kiss with a ghastly wail\n...\n\n",

        "The Dawn arose, the slumbers shadows have passed\nThe autumnal grace which so kindly has cast\nIt's sombre yet gracious delight on my grief\nEnshrouded and lulled by the winters far deeper relief\n\n...\n\n",

        "Aumquam orem dulcem obliviscor de ea somniare non cassavi.\nSed quod pulchrior et desiderandios illa somnia sunt ea major tristia mea cum expergiscor.\nTamen desiderio noctes illam dulces sed dolorosas, ut regno somnii amorem meum osculis teneris tegere et suun capillium aureum permulcere.\nConamen meae mentis spem tepirire interiret per scientia oprimeta.\nDevoratus per somnium obmutitum, lugen plenus desiderio.\n\nAs the lorn nightingales' melodious pain, dies away through the dusk-impregnated air,\nA sweet forgiving silence, delivers me from daily despair.\n\nDreams of sweetest emotion touch my heart and smother my daily suppressed cries, while a vision of beauty, pure and dear inspires me with a glimpse of paradise.\n\nWandering like a vagabond, expelled from the joys of men. Barred from the pleasure of company I solitary roam the night.\n\nHow should I ever summon my courage, when the bitter gale of failure dominates my heart? How should I ever enjoy the glare of the morning, when, with the fading of the shadows shelter, departs?\n\nAs the moon kisses the sea and casts its glitter on the water,\nand majestically silence engulfs the lands,\na dream woven of bitterness joy and desire stealthfully embraces my solitary heart.\n\nHoris lucis simplex\ncrescere, et somniator.\n...\n\n", 
        "Wandering restless through the hillside on a cold December day, my solitary journey guided only by the pilgrims high in the sky.\nFog invades the lands blocking the last rays of the dying sun and a veil of mist and serenity gracefully covers the night.\nThe shadowy trees of the forest, once imbued with beauty and life now twisted and eternally frozen by a shroud of snow and ice.\nAs the glow of the dawning sun vanishes in the witherd sky my eyes wander up through the whispering winds and watch the glare of the stars dilute.\nExposed to the frost of the icy winds my bittered soul still rejoys.\nAs the howl of the wind enchants me more than the sweetest sounding human voice.\nFreed from mens insanity I feel my grief stricken heart still burn bracing my soul through night's loneliness I sence a glimpse of shelter return.\nBurdend with the insight of my loneliness I continue my journey through this night.\nPassed have the times when the glimmer of hope filled my heart with gentle delight.\nAll the years that the currents of fortune have planted the seeds of my grief my eyes have been fooled by the masks of joy, my desperate hopes deceived.\n...\n\n"
