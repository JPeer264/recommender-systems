        "Bow your head close your eyes,\npray that you'll see your son again.\nHe's been there your whole life,\nwatching the door for you to come in.\n\nHe's not like other boys,\nhe's got good ideas, his thoughts are real.\nBut now he's lost his head, his heart and soul,\nHe cannot feel.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Is it this air that turns me cold?\nThis time of year I feel alone.\nThe wind blows and dries my skin.\nThese people keep to themselves, all living in their own hell.\nI need to get out of the place I'm in.\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me in.\nI'm outside of your house.\nI've got some things to say.\nI once knew where you hid the key to your house.\nIt's not there and now I'm waiting outside.\n...\n\n", 
        "Sixteenth day into the year,\nthe drive was quiet.\nI had thoughts in my head.\nIt was all bad news.\n\nWe sat parked,\nand I opened up,\nyou shut down.\nThis night will only get worse.\nIt was all bad news.\n...\n\n", 
        "My day is coming\nMy day is coming up soon\nAnd I've been waiting\nAnd I've been waiting in my room\nAnd I've been thinking\nAnd I've been thinking about my life\nAnd no, I'm not scared\nBut hell, I'm horrified\n\nAnd if I just stay here\nI can avoid all the car accidents\n...\n\n", 
        "I gave up long ago,\nthought you'd never show.\nI saw your face shine like the sun,\nit glows, thought I'd let this go.\n\nYour depression shows when you talk about home.\nYou said: \"I can't wait to leave this town and go away on my own\".\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I try to find my plight,\nbut it wouldn't show itself to me.\nSo I got lost along the way,\nit seems that everything is grey,\nbut that's ok.\n\nI know it's out there waiting for me,\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I've been running away from you for the past couple years,\nspent my days down by the river,\nand hoped to see your face.\nAnd it's been hard to speak up when no one is listening to me,\ncompared to you I am so small, so small.\n\nYour words cannot tell me that my neighbour is burning.\nFor that I can't believe. So tell me, am I burning too?\n\nThe sky's your window, but where am I hiding?\nI've been waiting.\n\nIt's always on my troubled mind.\n...\n\n", 
        "Keep your head up boy he said to me.\nCan't you let this go?\nI'll never have my turn again,\nbut I never really know.\n\nYou call yourself a cowboy,\nbut you just can't let things go.\nYou sold your soul to a woman\nwho left you for her heavenly home.\n...\n\n"
