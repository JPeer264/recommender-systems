        "Son:\nYou say my life is full of shame\nUnbalanced child in wasted roads\nPlease call me son\nI need you mum\nWhy didn't you dry my frightened tears\n\nMum:\nI don't know how you can be here\nYou can't be true\nI've burned your soul\nI am the prophet of new world\nI've heard the devil through your voice\n\nSon:\nThey showed me how you wiped out life\nYour hands were cold and full of sweat\nYou stripped my neck with no regret\nMy white eyes lit up whole night\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Howl of trees attracts the Enemy\nDumb breathing seems so loud\nthe leaves are quivering in the wind\nthey turn shadows into light.\n\nCursed wood, you trap a lot of lifes\nThe mine one's part of them\nJesus, bless me, I'm afraid to die\nwhy do you live me alone?\n\nChorus\nMade up faces next to me\nthe smell of blood's attracted them\nYou have to face with it!\n...\n\n", 
        "Nobody told you what happened in your past\nEveryone hid you the truth\nYou\u00b4re not what you think to be, run away\nI saw that, then I cried for you!\nLeave the city and never think of revenge!\nIt\u00b4s what they want from you!\nDon\u00b4t turn your eyes and don\u00b4t you stop for a breath\n\u00b4Cause they\u00b4ll realize\nBlood of lies inside your life\nIt pressed upon your brain\nYou didn\u00b4t know what was the galf\nYou sometimes felt in mind!\nSon of pride and devil\u00b4s lies\nYour being\u00b4s made up of limph\nThey pulled it out from their own hands\nSad angel with no God!\n...\n\n", 
        "Inside the wild roar den\nTrought twisted roots of black oak\nThe torn grass forms some long trails\nHe dragged a man into that gloomy hole\n\"Believe me! I don\u00b4t know why!\"\nSometimes he felt so strong\nThe memories are so weak\nA danger steeped in unwittingness\nThe hell at night but he didn\u00b4t know why\n\"Will my God forgive these crimes?\"\nI\u00b4m afraid to survive\n...\n\n", 
        "Laying down in (the) dark cell\nCrying bitter tears\nWaiting for freedom\nTime\u00b4s running out\nSleeping on this cold stone\nIce inside as well\nI feel so faithless\nGod\u00b4s gonna away\nIs this bunch of misery\n...\n\n", 
        "Black sky trought my closed window\nCryptic sun light\nI am waiting for this storm\nLeft me outside\nFear and tears are hitting my face\nDimming my view\nLet them fall down with blind rage\nLet me outside!\nI still believe my fear will be afraid to\nDrown in my soul, I still believe!\n...\n\n", 
        "Awaking in the morning late\nSunny day behond the glass\nShadows now are close to shapes\nAnd even closer to myself\nThe shower seems to cry on me\nMirror spreads an unknown face\nMangry cat is whining on\nThe backyard looks like scary fog!\nMy bag is full of hate\nI\u00b4ve got it for too much time\nNo one knows what\u00b4s kept inside\n...\n\n",

        "Sometimes I can't recognize\nMy own self defaced by this mask\nThat kills my image worn out\nBy the fake and by the mistake\nAt times I look in the eyes\nOf those who want me as a prize! \nThey ask for another one! \nIt seems they don't understand! \n\nBridge\nDebating a frustrating life\n...\n\n", 
        "Once again I've breathed the fire\nAwaking inside those feelings\nThat won't go! \nI've sensed this before\n\nAnother weak and cruel desire\nBothering me and it won't leave me alone! \nI won't pay this toll\n\nChorus\n...\n\n", 
        "When the flame inside you burns out\nA gust of cold wind freezes your breath:\nA prelude for the Dark Hand\nTo catch your soul, \nYou can imagine will happen to all\n\nBridge\nIt comes dressed in shades\nFrom the silence of nowhere\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't want your dirty eyes pointing on me! \nDon't wanna see your face tricking me another time! \nMy life reached it's pinnacle\nBut your wet touch isn't my goal.\nI fly to different skies, \nI can't stand no more your lies! \n\nBridge\nAnother stupid soul has fallen into my trick again! \nAnother pure soul will increase my reign! \nI am the rainbringer, the ruler stronger than your gof! \nAnd you will drown forever lost! \n...\n\n", 
        "I can feel that thing again\nIt lurks down in my pain\nEvery morning it's the same\nI can't stand it no more\n\nAnd I've walked and walked alone\nUntil the smile if who knows\nHow to put up with my jokes\n\nAll the tears that I kept from falling down, now I can\nLet them shiver away and leave aside the shame\n...\n\n", 
        "Another drop falls from a flower\nAnd it seems it could take an hour\n(I'm) drowning I can't breathe\nI can't cope with this bleak sensation\nI feel killed by anger and frustration\nThis won't be our last good-bye\n\nA blast of wind has blown out your candle\nIt's a pain that I could't handle\nTears are bursting out of my bleeding eyes\nI cant't cope with this situation\n...\n\n", 
        "Lost!\nCaught by the smile of the moon,\nwandering through the unknown,\nremembering how was my home,\nraped by the cold of the\n\nSolitude that I detest,\nit aches inside when I can't rest... I Fear!\nVoices whispering my name,\nchasing dreams that look so vane...\nthe well behind the gate will soon change my fate!\n\nFrost... getting inside of my wounds,\n...\n\n", 
        "They told him don't you ever come around here\nDont wanna see your face, you better disappear\nThe fires in their eyes and their words are really clear\nSo beat it, just beat it\n\nYou better run, you better do what you can\nDont wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man\nYou wanna be tough, better do what you can\nSo beat it, but you wanna be bad\n\nJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\nNo one wants to be defeated\nShowing how funky strong is your fighter\nIt doesn't matter who's wrong or right\nJust beat it, beat it\nJust beat it, beat it\nJust beat it, beat it\nJust beat it, beat it\n\nThey're out to get you, better leave while you can\nDont wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man\n...\n\n", 
        "Looking out from my isolation\nDeep inside from my alienation\nThe night will heal my morbid fascination\nAnother day has gone away\n\nMy disintegration, it's not just a sensation\nBut another accusation\nAfter I've been bursed, lost and so confused\nI practiced so much violation\n\nViolation that was, always present because\nI used to dream blindfold\n...\n\n"
