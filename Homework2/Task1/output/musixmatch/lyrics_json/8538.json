        "Well in the town where I was raised\nThe clock ticks and the cattle graze\nTime passed with amazing grace\nBack where I come from\n\nYou could lie on a riverbank\nOr paint your name on a water tank\nOr miscount all the beers you drank\nBack where I come from\n\nBack where I come from\nWhere I'll be when it's said and done\nWell I'm proud as anyone\nThat's where I come from\n\nWe learned in a Sunday school\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "When I feel that chill, smell that fresh cut grass\nI'm back in my helmet, cleats and shoulder pads\nStanding in the huddle listening to the call\nFans going crazy for the boys of fall\nThey didn't let just anybody in that club\nTook every ounce of heart and sweat and blood\nTo get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall\nKings of the school man, we're the boys of fall\n\n(Chorus:)\nWell it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes\nIt's fighting back them butterflies\nIt's call it in the air, alright yes sir we want the ball\nAnd it's knocking heads and talking trash\nIt's slinging mud and dirt and grass\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate\nSpilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans\nIt's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent\nNot a minute left for me to be me\n\nBeen going like nothing can wait\nI gotta get my priorities straight\n\nI need to live a little, have some fun\nTake some time, waste it on number one\nFind a girl that brings my whole world to a stop\nLive a little, love a lot\n\n...\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",

        "Some folks livin' in the country can't wait to get in their pickup trucks and go to town\nThere's people livin' in a penthouse dying to get out in the sticks and ride around\nThere's a man up on a mountain top who wants to go down and breathe the salt air by the shore\nThere's a guy on an island he ain't smilin' and don't want to be on an island anymore\n\nThere's a lady locked in a love affair wouldn't care if she was single again\nThere's a lonely soul who's only goal is to get that golden ring upon their hand\nIn the middle of nowhere there's a nobody tryin' to get that 15 minutes of fame\nSomeplace there's a superstar thinkin' Lord if I could only change my name\n\nRound and round and round and round we go\nWhy we can't be satisfied I don't know\n\nI don't know...\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
