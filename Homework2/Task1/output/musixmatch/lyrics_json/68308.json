        "Dangerous lines that glow in the moonlight\nI've been crossing worlds of silver seas\nTo numbers and colors and absolute hours\nA life I lived, held down inside their arms\n\nNow to waking night I've come to pay\nAll my debts they turned and tossed away\nNow they drink to sparkle their mistakes\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a circle of tangled wires\nWith an endless trail into bedrooms - that connected them all\nSo you speak lies, speak your mind\nBut all these words can be dulled out with the pills they discovered\n\nPretend that I don't have a limit\nYour body of glass and your fingers intwined stringed\nThey're behind your back\nCan be seen\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You can see I am in shock\nTo catch you wearing wires underneath your heart\nIt was mechanical\nBut we were born to endless architecture\nSpinning to a fault and infinitely strewn\nWhere you'd be ahead of your time\n\n'Cause in this place it's beautiful\n\nTracing lines your flaws connect the starry skies\n...\n\n", 
        "Storm turns inside me like seas in the storm drains\nThis is not who I am\nPatterns of futures that wander away in mysterious planes\n\nThrough the window\nI can see you sun lit golden eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "We are drifting in and out of time once again\nA moment with suspended hours\nAll the while oblivious to casts from the grave\nSome quiet poised and waiting aim\n\nWe are no more than criminals to take what we never had\nAnd across the night there's some criminal who gives what we never had\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(When will your love unfold your life?)\n\nFrom a lonely spell I felt another life\nIt leapt before me some dangerous grace\n\nBelieve when I say that I want to try\n...\n\n", 
        "Light stings his eyes\nCan't turn back now\nIt was so slow that they couldn't predict it\nHis mind is just treading in infinite space\n\n'Cause he can't believe some mysterious chamber\nBroke a dangerous leak\nThat turned to a storming sea it's swallowing up\n...\n\n", 
        "They knew my hands were still wrapped around\nWhat they claimed were diamonds from inside\nThe long hallway I'm floating down to their corridor\n\nAnd at first I saw the flashes and the beams\n...\n\n", 
        "I woke inside an avalanche\nThe floor is caving under me\nA helicopter's resonating sound\nI heard before the drop\nWas proof of semiconic odds\nThat my heart below was fluttering\n\nAnd in the darkest hour, I still believe in lights\n...\n\n", 
        "Help! Things have shaken me\nVascular waves, tracing the same three colorings I have\nBut now I've just noticed this\n\nSlow motion inside\nChanging this all somehow\n...\n\n",

All that's in my sight\nAre darkened dreams of empty lies\n\nHope is there it is waiting it is real\nYou are only what you want to feel\nI can see your eyes and they are asking\n\nWe're a new hope generation\nWe can see the wasted lives in your faces\nBut we can see Messiah rise in these places\nUntil the tears are gone\n\nWe're a new hope generation\nWe can see the wasted lives in your faces\nBut we can see Messiah rise in these places\nUntil the tears are gone\n\nI've seen you before, you're always on your face\nTrying to find the traces left\nHungry and tired, waiting for your needs\n...\n\n",
