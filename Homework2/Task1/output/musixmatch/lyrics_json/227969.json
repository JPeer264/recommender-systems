        "So this is how it ends\nThis is where it all goes down\nThis is what \"I don't love you\" feels like\nIt ain't the middle of the night\nAnd it ain't even rainin outside\nIt ain't exactly what I had in mind for goodbye\n\nAt a red light in the sunshine, on a Sunday\nNothin to say, don't even try\nSome are comin home, some are leavin town\nWhile my world's crashing down\nOn a Sunday in the sunshine\nAt a red light\n\nI thought she was gonna say\nSomethin bout that couple kids and crossin the street\n...\n\n", 
        "I ain't never seen the snowfall on the Delta\nLike the one that's gonna cover all of New York tonight\nBut it sure do remind me of those miles and miles of cotton\nLong ago but not forgotten, yeah, that's a southern man's field of white\n\nYeah, I turned my back and walked away\nBut lately I ain't seen a sunny day\nBeen thinking 'bout rolling on back home\nBack where I belong\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "I can hear you downstairs crying on the phone\nTelling someone that I'm here but you still feel all alone\nMaybe we were too young\nGoodbye, I've gotta go\nI can hear the baby waking up\nGot to get back to the life I know\n\nI should have never believed him\nMaybe I should just leave here\n\nMaybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in\nDon't give up on me\nI'm about to come alive\nAnd I know that it's been hard\nAnd it's been a long time coming\nDon't give up on me\nI'm about to come alive\n...\n\n",

        "She said, \"California,\" as a tear fell down her cheek\n\"Small town Missouri just ain't the life for me.\"\nWaved goodbye to mom and dad, and all her friends\nIn that '97 Mustang, that we both lost it in\n\nI can't recall the day I'd finally had enough\nChasing my father's dream instead of growing up\nI turned in that uniform before I ever played a game\nWith a junior college scholarship in a white trash town upstate\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, the turn signal's clicking\nAnd the seconds are slipping away\nJust a little bit more of this turnpike\nAnd so much to say\n\nThe airport traffic, it slows us to a still\nI turn the radio down\nAnd leave one hand on the wheel\n\nWell I don't know what to tell you\nWhat do you wanna hear\nYou see, guys like me, we just disappear\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I was the only one down at Keeva Dun\nwho didn't drive a car that wasn't cool enough\njust a baby blue parking lot Grand Am\nnot exactly a magnet for the women\nuntil i hung that surfboard out the back\n\nfor tips and caddies at the local court\nthe night i mixed both drinks down on the wharf\nflirtin with the college girls getting my barefoot wet out in the world\nfell in love 100 times\n\ntime was mine and life was easy\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes you see someone\nWhen you've already got someone\nStill you wonder what if they had come\nAlong, a long time ago\nYou know that they're feeling it too\nBut there ain't nothing you gonna do\nExcept for imagine who you might have been with them\nThey're not tryin' to make it last\nJust enjoying each second as they pass\n\nChorus:\n'Cause as these little brick houses are flying by\n'Neath the flickering of the railcar lights\n...\n\n", 
        "If heaven's where your soul gets fed\nYour hell is an empty bed\nBut it's never hard to keep it full\nThere ain't too many arms you have to pull\n\nYou think that you're getting love\nThey know they're just getting some\nAnd deep inside you know it's true\nBut you don't dare believe it, do you? Do you?\n\nYou just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track\nSticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back\nIt won't do you no good to change your mind\n'Cause it already fell off somewhere down the line\n\nNow all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time\nLooking for a good time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I know what you think, here we go again\nThe same waste of potential that I've always been\nI've been given the chances and I've burned some bridges up\nHad a million excuses why I self-destruct\n\nBut this time around I'm a little more ready now\nI'm a little bit older, a little more figured out\nThis time around\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Usually take one last pass through town\nStop the car and touch the ground\nWatch those streetlights\nSwayin' in the breeze\n\nDecorated store fronts\nRusty old gas pumps\nTry to fill my mind up with\nSomethin' 'fore I go\n\nPicture postcard memories\nWell, they always make for good company\n\nI don't know no town like the old town\nEven when the miles are many, I feel like I'm still around\nDeep inside me like rings through an oak tree\nYeah, there's something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone\n\nThat keeps me turning home\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's gonna be a long hot summer\nThe heat's gonna come for sure\nMakin' you love me might take longer\nBut down here everythin' is slow\nSheets are blowin' on the clothes line\nA honeysuckle make you smell so sweet\nThe way they feel when you lay down on 'em\nYou can't get from no machine\nI know you come down every season\nTo waste time on your grandpa's farm\nI ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'\nA little sun won't do no harm\n...\n\n",

        "It's killin' me to write the word goodbye\nI've wadded it up and tossed it a thousand times\nWe both know the reason\nThere ain't nothin' to explain\nBut I know that my leavin'\nWill spare us both the pain\n\n(Desiree), I can't hold you any longer\n(Desiree), You love his money more than me\nNow that taxi's at the gate\nI guess all that's left to say\nIs in teardrops at the bottom of the page\nI love you Desiree\n\nIt'd be easier to leave if I were mad\nBut it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have\n...\n\n", 
        "Sunset on a chapel\nWhen I close my eyes I see her and she's praying\nRipples in the holy water\nKneeling in the light that is fading\nAsking for forgiveness\n'Cause she knows that it is me\nThat she is breaking\nAngel flying with my heart\nShe rides on the edge of no tomorrow\nIn a rusty El Comino\nShe flies as wild as the wind\nOn the border of Laredo\nShe rides away\nQuestions in the dark\nShe rides away\n...\n\n", 
        "It's hard to find the perfect time to say something\nyou know, is gunna change everything\nLiving with the shame,\nit ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face\nNow me and my pile of things\nthat she threw out the window,\nDrowning next to me\nNo seven years of good cant hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring\n\nSo let it rain, let it pour, she don't love me anymore,\nJust let it come down on me, let it come down on me,\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll follow you like a bridge to the end of the world\nI'll take you with me everywhere I go, girl\nBut you ran from love like a bullet from a gun\nThat [Incomprehensible] burn my heart deep as its desert sun\n\nYou never told me it was over\nYou never told me anything at all\n\nNow I'm out on the road and asking myself\nWhy I never told you that my love was true\nWell, I thought you knew, yeah, I thought you knew\n...\n\n", 
        "When the rooms are crowded eyes will wander\nNever knowing what they'll find\nI came in waiting on another\nNow you're all that's on my mind\nBeneath a chorus of conversation\nWhat no one else can see\nIs a gamble between two strangers\nThat's taken a hold of me\nSo, let go of your halo\nBreak free for a while\nTell me that you're ready\nAnd into the night\n...\n\n", 
        "Half Mile Hill, eight years old\nStanding on top with the world below\nMe and my dad\nTalking man to man\n\nSuitcase packed, he was moving out\nSaid, \"It's no one's fault but I had my doubts\nAnd I have them still\"\nUp on Half Mile Hill\n\nYou can see the ball fields\nWatch the cars go 'round the courthouse\nSee the sun go down where the street lamps glow\nOn those checkerboard roads\n\nWishing I could fly like a cut-string kite\nTapping on the floor of heaven\nIs anybody listening?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Waking up in the sand\nSunburn on your nose\nYou scream and squeezed my hand\nWhen your East Kentucky toes hit the Atlantic\nSummertime in Brooklyn\nMustard on your lip\nI knew I loved you by the bottom of the fifth\nI never planned it\nA million perfect moments\nGo rushing through my brain\nOur first trip to the ocean\nYour first time on a plane\nWhen you look over your shoulder\nBaby, you can choose\nTo remember me however you want to\n...\n\n",

Will Hoge]\nThe sun is shining but it's still cold\nThis January is bitter as I've ever known\nYou're always smiling, there's no reason to be\nYou're always chipper at least that's how it seems\nWell, Catherine I can't give you anything\nMuch more than this couple hundred dollar ring\nAnd promises ain't never been my strength\n...\n\n"
