        "I'm a man\nThat's what you raised me to be\nI'm not an identity crisis\nThis was planned\n\nI'm a man\nThere's innocence in all mankind\nIt's what kind of animal I am\nIt's that simple, oh\n\nI'm a man\nAnd not just casually\nI pull the sparks fulltime\nThe tree house cannot support me\n...\n\n", 
        "My brain makes drugs to keep me slow\nA hilarious joke for some dead pharaoh\nBut now, not even the masons know\nWhat drug will keep night from coming\n\nThere are so many tools that are made for my hands\nBut the tide smashes all my best-laid plans to sand\nAnd there's always someone to say it's easy for me\nBut I revenge myself all over myself\nThere's nothing you can say to me\n\nYou never held it at the right angle\nYou never held it at the right angle\nCatch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star\nBut wash your hands of it\n...\n\n", 
        "When you catch the light\nYou look like your mother\nIt crushes me some,\nJust right from the side\n\nWhen you catch the light\nThere's a flash of wild creatures,\nBefore the Stone Age of the preachers,\nAnd the husbands, and the wives\n\nWhen you catch the light\n...\n\n", 
        "Way down in Bowling Green\nPrettiest girls I've ever seen\nA man in Kentucky sure is lucky\nTo love down in Bowling Green\n\nBowling Green folks treat you kind\nThey let you think your own mind\nA man in Kentucky sure is lucky\nIn Bowling Green you walk your own line\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Thanks\nThanks a lot\nI got a broken heart\nThat's all I've got\nYou made me cry\nNow I cried a lot\nI lost your love honey\nThanks a lot\n\nYou told our friend\nAs I was passin' by\nThat you're not sorry\nThat you made me cry\n...\n\n", 
        "Want to get it all behind me\nYou know everything reminds me\nI can't be myself without you\nWant to crawl down deep inside\nThe springs inside the mattress\nWhere l cry my dirty secrets\n'Cause I just can't shake this feeling\nThat I'm nothing in your eyes\n\nAnd if I knew heartbreak was coming\nI would've set out running\nPast the city houses\nAnd the ditches on the highway\n...\n\n", 
        "Voices that did comfort me\nAre furthest from my sanity\nAnd come from places I have never seen\nEven in my darkest recollection\nThere was someone singin' my life back to me\n\nThe life you learn from someone else\nThat you can only trust yourself\nSometimes that is still too much to want\n\nMorality won't get you through the mazes\n...\n\n", 
        "So far away\nCurses wild upon you\nHungry and gaining\nPorchlight burns so far away\nMiles away\n\nDays have gone by and I've barely gone\nSafe on the road that speeds from your front door\nI can't turn around 'cause I long to be forgiven\n\n...\n\n", 
        "So many people who live in my town\nThey mind to my business they've none of their own\nThey are so happy now that I've done wrong\nI'm surprised they don't come up and thank me\n\nSo if you have moral advice\nI suggest you just tuck it all away\n'Cause my mood to burn bridges\nIs not unlike my mood to dig ditches\nDon't cross me on either a day, baby\n\nDon't make mistakes or be human\n...\n\n", 
        "Lie in bed and ignore the TV\nWatch the clouds sift through the aero\nAnd you'll be in my arms again\nThere's no need to cry\n\nOf all the things so bittersweet\n...\n\n", 
        "Tenderly\nTenderly\nPlease take my breath from me\nInto the fountain\nAnd up from the graves\n\nTearfully\nJoyfully\nBurn what is left of me\nI don't want these burdens\nI've handsomely gained (?)\n\nYou'll be my guest\n...\n\n", 
        "I want to tell you about my hometown\nIt's a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound\nWell the factories churn and the timbers all cut down\nAnd life goes by slow in Tacoma\n\nPeople they laugh when they hear you're from my town\nThey say it's a sour and used up all place\nI defended its honor, shrugged off the put downs\nYou know that you're poor, from Tacoma\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh my darling, oh my darling\nHow can you forget?\nAll the love we had between us\nNow it's like we've never met\n\nOh it kills me, how it kills me\nWhen I think I held you up\nYou were golden, I was blind\nWith your poison in my blood\n\nBittersweet are the memories\nThat make old lovers pine\n...\n\n", 
        "Well it's hot in the yard\nAnd it's cool in the bed\nAnd I whip the blankets into cotton thread\nAnd I'll tear all the carpet up over my head\n'Til my feet can go right through the basement\n\nWell you play so surprised at what you have found\nBut I heard you coming from way across town\nSo let's get to getting to burning it down\nAnd the fire, it's spreading like madness\n\n'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure\nI've snapped from my tether\nThat the nation may vibrate apart\n...\n\n", 
        "I put on that sweater you gave me\nI woke up in the kitchen a few minutes later\nI didn't know how I had gotten there\nDid you guide me\nI didn't make it to your funeral\nI didn't want ritual nor resign\nI just wanted to hold hands with\nJ.P and Mary-Jo\nBut I couldn't conjure tears\nWe're too good for stupid angels\nBlackness held its breath beside me\nAnd burned the air till it was gone\n...\n\n"
