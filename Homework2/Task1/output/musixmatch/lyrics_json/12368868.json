        "I was wrong\nFor the first time in a century\nAnd no one believed me\nBut it hurt like a bitch\nYou said? Bye?\nIn a way that almost fit me\nAnd how you? re leaving\nGod! it? s making me sick\nShe said? You? re almost worth dying for?\n\nAnd who? s gonna kiss me goodnight? (if you go)\nAnd who? s gonna stay to help me turn out the lights?\nI was scared when you got scared,\nBut we can be alright, just don? t leave tonight.\nOh don? t leave tonight.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "She said Sing me a lullaby so sweet,\nThat the lights would stay away from me\nBecause my eyes see things they shouldn't see\nHelp me\nSo I started to tremble out a verse\nBut my words weren't lining up with her\nBut then the way that she hurt was even worse\nThan without me\n\nSo I got high\nAnd I lost faith in a melody\nWritten for a girl when I had nothing left to hide,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Just in case, not just in time\nI don't have to make it out of here alive\nI know I'll try for the rest of my life to make it up to you\nIf they're alright then I'm insane\nTo ever want to walk through all of this again\nSo what's a couple bottles of wine between me and the fall?\n\nYou can assume that I am here and on my own\nYou can assume I figured out the road's too short to walk alone\nNow I can't do it by myself, you know I won't\nShe said \"You're better off in New York, stay gone\"\n\nI don't wanna stay gone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I must assume you're looking at me\nCause i know somethings that we need to know about here\nAnd we pretend that we both got wings\nAnd both of us sing\nSo we'll sing till we fly out of here\n\nOh maybe then we'll come back down\nYa maybe then we'll come back down\n\nCan we believe in things we cant see\nWithout them we seem to disappear like we evaporate\nAnd when we leave untraceable seams\nThat tear and we bleed we need a martyr that wont hesitate\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Wait this isn't me\nThat you're talking to\nThis is a front that I put on\nThe Verse\nIn every song\nIn every word\n\nAnd say whatever you can\nThe story's a lie\nThey fed us an ending\nThat left us alright\nAnd this is the world\nAnd this is the page\n\nFrom a book I wouldn't read,\nFor goodness sake\n\nAnd right now where you are I guess you're over it\nBut I can't see\nHow you without me\nCould possibly make any sense\nAnd right now all you need is just some time to mend\nOh well take all you need\nBut my sanity is forever riding on this\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "He was sitting on the back porch singing, \"You're My Only Sunshine\"\nSwinging to songs only he heard in his head\nNow he's cutting paper swords from boxes to hang inside his room\nAnd watch 'em spin into the wind above his bed\n\nSinging \"Take me down this road I'm on\nIt's late and I don't wanna go alone.\nTake me down this road\nI won't be scared, 'cause we can't be scared.\"\n\nAnd I'm searching for a sign that you're still here\nAnd I'm alright but now I'm down here on the ground\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
