        "All hope abandon, ye who enter here\nSaid the sign I read that was hangin' above her bed\nAnd the sirens all were wailin', but a man can ignore the signs\nGotta keep a good eye on the windin' road ahead\n\nAnd my first sin was a young American girl\nMy first sin was a young American girl\n\nAnd I spent time 'neath the trestles\nWith the punks and the dime store saints\n...\n\n", 
        "We are the last of the jukebox Romeos\nWe are romantics by the light of the fourway\nWe came to sing out a chorus, reinvent the good times\nAnd bring it all back home again\n\nHoney, we came to dance with the girls with the stars in their eyes\nDo the jump back, jack, stop and slide to the right\nNever break their hearts, never make them cry, come on\nStrike up the band, play a song that everybody knows\nIf I'm not your kind, then don't tell a soul\nI'm not the one who hates bein' alone, so come on\n\nAnd in this unstable arena\nOf what's left or become of my America\nI'm askin' this dance so come take my hand, come on\nAnd in this unstable arena\nOf what's left or become of my America\nI'm askin' this dance so come take my hand, come on\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In my head I am already gone\nSide roads boarded up, decisions decided on\nBut in my nights there are restless hours\nWhen 3 AM comes down and nothing else comes up\n\nAnd the only thing we know\nIs it's getting dark and we'd better go\nAnd the only thing we see\nAre the despairs of the day\n\nAnd if you're too tired\nGo to sleep my brothers, I\nAnd if you're too tired\nGo to sleep my brothers, I'm all right to drive\n\nAnd in my heart I'm the weary kind\nI'm much tired to cry\nThough it's sad enough for tears\nIt's been try, fail, try for years\n...\n\n"
