        "My heart flies on her wings\nNow I'm crying, moon is red\nTomorrow'll be another hell\nTo the sun, the sky's soul is fed\n\nBlows pass me by, I can not feel\nOnly the shadows now are real\n\nWhy did she do it? Why did she die?\nHow could she leave without sayin' goodbye?\n...\n\n", 
        "How about getting off of these antibiotics\nHow about stopping eating when I'm filled up\nHow about changing line 'couse it don't make sense\nHow about that ever elusive kudo\n\nThank you India\nThank you terror\nThank you disillusionment\nThank you frailty\nThank you consequence\nThank you thank you silence\n\nHow about me not blaming you for everything\nHow about me enjoying the moment for once\nHow about how good it feels to finally forgive you\n...\n\n", 
        "Here is the moment\nAnd the coil has been unwound\n\nHere is the moment\nNothing wears me down\n\nHere is the moment\nThere's no need to pretend\nTo think about the future\n...\n\n", 
        "We stood in front of tanks at Tiananmen Square,\nFrom Berlin to Chiapas we are everywhere,\nAnd over the sirens of the police cars,\nYou can hear us shout The streets are ours!\n\n'69 Chicago ushered in a new age,\nWe brought the war home with the days of rage,\nAnd over the sirens of the police cars,\nYou can hear us shout The streets are ours!\n...\n\n",
