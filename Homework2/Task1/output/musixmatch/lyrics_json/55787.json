        "Picking up the pieces of my heart left on the floor\nLike it was written in the stars\nThat I was meant for something more\nNow I'm the one man I'll be fighting everybody's war\nWill I survive? I must survive...\n\nThe world is on my shoulders so much pressure to\nprevail\nThis is the story of my life and it's a sad and lonely tale\nSo what's the point in trying if your destiny's to\nfail\nYou won't survive, but I must survive\n...\n\n", 
        "Do do do do do do\nDo do do do do do\nDo do do do do do do\n\nShe's got a lip ring and five colours in her hair\nNot into fashion but I love the clothes she wears\nHer tattoos always hidden by her underwear\nBut she don't care\n\nEverybody wants to know her name\nI threw a house party and she came\nEveryone asked me\nWho the hell is she?\nThat weirdo with five colours in her hair\n\nShe's just a loner with a sexy attitude\n...\n\n", 
        "(Tom)\nRecently I've been\nHopelessly reachin\nOut for this girl\nWho's out of this world\nBelieve me\n\nShe's got a boyfriend\nHe drives her round the bend\nCause he's 23\nHe's in the marines\nHe'd kill me\n\nFor so many nights now\nI find myself thinkin about her now ohhh\n\nCause obviously she's out of my league\nBut how can I win\nShe keeps draggin me in\nAnd I know I\nNever will be good enough for her\nNo no\nI never will be good enough for her\n\n...\n\n", 
        "One, two, three, four\n\nWent out with the guys and before my eyes\nThere was this girl, she looked so fine\nAnd she blew my mind and I wished that she was mine\nAnd I said, \"Hey wait up 'cause I'm off to speak to her\"\n\nAnd my friends said\n(You'll never get her, you're never gonna get that girl)\nBut I didn't care\n (You'll never get her, you're never gonna get that girl)\n\n'Cause I loved her long blond hair\n (You'll never get her, you're never gonna get that girl)\nAnd love was in the air\n\nAnd she looked at me\n (You'll never get her, you're never gonna get that girl)\nAnd the rest was history\n(You'll never get her, you're never gonna get that girl)\n\nDude you're being silly 'cause you're never gonna get that girl\nAnd you're never gonna get the girl\n\nWe spoke for hours\n...\n\n", 
        "This girl that moved just up the road from me,\nShe had the nicest legs I've ever seen.\nBack then, she wrote me letters just to say she loved me,\nBut now her face is just a memory.\nNow that seven years have gone,\nAnd I've grown up but she's moved on,\nand some how I'm still holding on, to her!\n\nChorus\nI still got so many unsaid things that I wanna say,\nAnd I just can't wait another day,\nI wish she knew.\nI still wait up wondering if she will remember me,\n...\n\n",
