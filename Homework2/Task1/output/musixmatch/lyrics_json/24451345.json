        "I've heard a lot of songs that were sung out of tune\nBut I learned to find the heart hidden deep in the dunes\nIt brings it to the fore what it means to be there\nWhen I hang on the core I've got music to share\nComing from above coming from afar\nComing from within is the voice of my heart\nHeaven's got an open door tonight\nHeaven's got an open door tonight\nHeaven's got an open door tonight\nWe have found the time to get it right\nHeaven's got an open door tonight\nI used to have a dream gonna fly like a bird\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
