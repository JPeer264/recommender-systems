        "Yo,\nI'm gettin older now\n23 years old and half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down\nThe other half's like, \"Hell no, you better mess around. Don't let me down, especially when you got an album comin' out\"\nWhen I first saw you, I'm like \"Aw shit, goddamit look what God did. Hail Mary Jesus!\"\nThree years later I'm sittin' in our apartment thinkin' about all the places that my heart's been\nI mean it's crazy right?\nThis is maybe wife [?] - the one that found me in a drought, pulled me out and made me right\nThrough the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leavin' town\nAnother couple thousand miles south, which leads to crazy fights\n\nAnd I don't know how to deal with it, I gotta be real with ya\nUh,\nEach day I get filled with the - feelin' of realer love, I wanna continue, what\nBut,\nThis ain't the same old love song cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone\nFor months on end all we have is phone calls\nWhat,\n\nYou know what makes it worth it?\nTo watch someone progress\nTo have them watch you\nSomeone that you respect and value and cry to\nIt's something so comforting cause it could bring so much truth\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Now nod your head and wake up\n\nI see so many people lost who really try to pretend\nBut am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend\nWhen I take a step to the mic is Hip-Hop closer to the end?\n'Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin\nThey marketed the windmill, the air flair and head spin\nAnd white rappers albums really get the most spins\nThe face of hip hop has changed a lot since Eminem\nAnd if he's taking away black artists' profits I look just like him\nClaimed a culture that wasn't mine, the way of the american\nHip-Hop is gentrified and where will all the people live\nIt's like the Central District, Beacon Hill to the South End\nBeing pushed farther away because of what white people did, now\nWhere's my place in a music that's been taken by my race\nCultural appropriated by the white face and we don't want to admit that this is existing\nSo scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege\n'Cause it's human nature to want to be part of something different\nEspecially when your ancestors are european christians\nAnd most whites don't want to acknowledge this is occurring\n'Cause we got the best deal, the music without the burden\nOf being black in a system that really wants you to rock\n'Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make Hip-Hop\nAnd we hate the mainstream cause we're the ones that took it\nNow we listen to Aesop Rock and wear t-shirts that say Brooklyn\nBut it's not about black and white, right?\nI mean, good music is good music regardless of what you look like\nBut when you don't give them props isn't that selfish?\nThat's like saying rock was actually started by Elvis\nSo where does this leave me?\nI feel like I pay dues but I'll always be a white MC\nI give everything I have when I write a rhyme\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
