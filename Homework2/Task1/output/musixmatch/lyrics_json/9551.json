        "I didn't know what time it was\nTill I met you.\nOh, what a lovely time it was,\nHow sublime it was too!\nI didn't know what day it was\nYou hold my hand.\nWarm like the month of May it was,\nAnd I'll say it was grand.\nGrand to be alive, to be young,\nTo be mad, to be yours alone!\nGrand to see your face, feel your touch,\nHear your voice say I'm yours alone.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I was a shy, demure type\nInhibited, insecure type of maid\nI stayed within my little shell\nTill a certain cutie told me I was swell\nNow I'm smug and snooty\nConfident as hell\n\nI want to be no-one but me\nI am in love with a lover who likes me the way I am\nI have my faults, he likes my faults\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
