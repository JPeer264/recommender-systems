        "There is a rose in Spanish Harlem\nA red rose up in Spanish Harlem\nIt is a special one, it's never seen the sun\nIt only comes out when the moon is on the run\nAnd all the stars are gleaming\nIt's growing in the street right up through the concrete\nBut soft and sweet and dreaming\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'\nOn this, our weddin' day\nDo not forsake me, oh my darlin'\nWait, wait along\n\nI do not know what fate awaits me\nI only know I must be brave\nAnd I must face a man who hates me\nOr lie a coward, a craven coward\nOr lie a coward in my grave\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
