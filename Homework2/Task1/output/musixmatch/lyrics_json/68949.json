        "I was stranded in shadows\nIt was all I ever knew\nI was pushed down in the darkness\nLost all hope of breaking through\nThere's no life inside that prison\nNo windows, just these walls and chains\nBut love was on a mission\nAnd I never will forget the day, you\nwoke my heart up\nYou made me brave\nYou lifted my eyes\nAnd called me by my name\n\nCome on, come on out of the darkness\nCome on, come on out of the night\nNo more, no more living in the shadows now\n\nStep into the light\n\nWhen I was shaky, You were steady\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
