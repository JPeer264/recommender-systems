        "I found a new life with you here\nA life that will burn bright through the years\nI can tell in the way you look\nThe signals are so clear\n\nI want a big house in the hills\nBut I don't need that life to make me feel\nLike I'm part of the crowd\nWho turns their backs to what is real\n\nWhoa, whoa\nYeah, it's a good day\nI know you know\nTo me you're everything\n\nWhoa, whoa\nYeah, it's a good day\nAnd I feel my life is changing\n\nI found a piece of what was left\nA mark that runs deep within this chest\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I couldn't bare with my world today\nWas the reason we let this fade\nAnd the only thing left was tried not true\nA love I could not save\n\nBut I'm here and I'm not afraid\nI can keep you from all this pain\nAnd now you're reading the notes of how to deal with me when I'm away\n\nHere's your chance\nDon't let it fall through\nKnow that in your life is where I am\nI'll be there to guide you\nIf you feel like you can't make it\nKnow you can\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh...\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I'm in with the shadows, the light on your doorstep\nWhen the streets are cold and quiet\nCan you hear me whisper, I don't think you can\nOut at the crosswalks, standing in traffic\nNot words or white noise, tune of the static\nCan you hear my footsteps, I know that you can't\nEven when I'm in your sight, I'm out of line\nMaybe I'm vacant by design\n\nStanding on the sidelines, feeling like the world's blind\nStaring through a blank face, maybe it's a bad time\nAlways at the right place at the wrong time\nStanding on the sidelines, waiting for the limelight\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
