        "It's late and I'm awake\nStaring at the wall\nOpen up my window\nHead floats out the door\n\nNo one else around\nThe shimmer takes my eye\nI lift my head\nBlinded by the sky\n\nFeel my weight in front\nFollowing the sound\nMoves away so fast\nFall down to the ground\n...\n\n",

        "Cut like a picture from a paper safely tucked away\nWell thats how my heart is for you\nYou keep yours guarded like a palace hiding all its jewels\nThats just how hard it is for you\nYou found somebody yeah ok well I found somebody too\nNo need to put on such a show\nIf we should fight it out Im sure we'll take it to the other\nNo one should ever have to know\n\nIts not over til its over\nOh no but we'll try\n...\n\n", 
        "Open your eyes, take a look, if you follow I will lead the way\nIt's never the same looking back, we don't wanna live in yesterday\nYou and I are alright because together we're the lock and the key\nCome on put your hand in my hand, live far from it we can both be free\n\nCause you~ you make me feel~\n\nAlways when I see you darling, you're up in the clouds above\n...\n\n",
