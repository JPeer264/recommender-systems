        "Let the water rise,\nLet the ground crack.\nLet me fall inside,\nlying on my back\nlying on my back\n\nDry your smoke-stung eyes,\nso you can see the light.\nstaring at the sky\nwatching stars collide\nwatching stars collide\n\nIf you leave,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "when i powder my nose\nhe will powder his gums\nand if i try to get close\nhe is already gone\ni don't know where he's going\ni don't know where he's been\nbut he is restless at night\nhe has horrible dreams\nso we lay in the dark\n'cause we've got nothing to say\njust the beating of hearts\nlike two drums in the gray\ni don't know what we're doing\ni don't know what we've done\nbut the fire is coming\nso i think we should run\ni think we should run, run, run\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "By tomorrow we'll be swimming with the fishes\nLeave out troubles on the side.\nAnd when the sun comes out,\nwe'll be nothing but dust,\njust the outlines of our house.\n\nBy tomorrow we'll be lost amongst the leaves,\nin a wind that chills the skeletons of trees,\nand when the moon, it shines, I will leave two lines.\nFind my love, then find me.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
