        "Lazy summer afternoon\nScreened in porch and nothin' to do\nI just kicked off my tennis shoes\nSlouchin' in a plastic chair\nRakin' my fingers through my hair\nI close my eyes and I leave them there\nAnd I yawn, and sigh, and slowly fade away\n\nDeep enough to dream in brilliant colors\nI have never seen\nDeep enough to join a billion people\nFor a wedding feast\nDeep enough to reach out and touch\nThe face of the One who made me\nAnd oh, the love I feel, and oh the peace\nDo I ever have to wake up\n\nAwakened by a familiar sound\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a candle in every soul\nSome brightly burning, some dark and cold\nThere is a Spirit who brings a fire\nIgnites a candle and makes His home\n\nSo carry your candle, run to the darkness\nSeek out the hepeless, confused and torn\nHold out your candle for all to see it\nTake your candle, and go light your world\nTake your candle, and go light your world\n\nFrustrated brother, see how he's tried to\n...\n\n", 
        "Last thing I remember, sayin' bye to yesterday\nGlad to see it over, pullin' covers over my head\nBut what were You doin' while I dreamt the night away\n'Cause I can tell that somethin's different\nAnd my eyes ain't even open yet\n\nI'm smellin' coffee, birds are singin' just outside\nHere comes Your mercy streamin' in with the morning light\nMy heart is racing, waking up to Your smile\nIt's a good morning, it's a good morning\n\nWell, I remember readin' You're the God who never sleeps\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I am on the other side of the radio\nWondering why I'm here and why anybody cares what I say\nNo, I'm not a better man 'cause I'm singing my songs on the radio\n'Cause we're all the same\nAt the end of the day\n\nNow I imagine you on the other side of the radio\nDoing your homework, or driving with your windows down on the freeway\nI see you tapping the wheel, I see you bobbing your head to the radio\nOh, and it makes my day\nTo see that smile on your face\nAnd in some small way\nI remember my place\n...\n\n", 
        "You think I'd have it down by now\nBeen practicin' for thirty years\nI should have walked a thousand miles\nSo what am I still doin' here\nReachin' out for that same old piece of forbidden fruit\nI slip and fall and I knock my halo loose\nSomebody tell me what's a boy supposed to do?\n\nI get so clumsy\nI get so foolish\nI get so stupid\nAnd then I feel so useless\nBut You're sayin' You love me\nAnd You're still gonna hold me\nAnd that You wanna be near me\n'Cause You're makin' me holy\n...\n\n", 
        "Prayers went on but it never came down\nPrayers went on but it never came down\nPrayers went on but it never came down\n\nPrayers went on but it never came down\nPrayers went on but it never came down\nPrayers went on but it never came down\n\nMy memories of my brothers and me\nMake me marvel at the way the years went by\nHere we are, how'd we ever get this far?\nI wonder how, and I wonder why\n\nThen I recall what these boys often saw\nWhen we would stop to look at mom and daddy's door\nThey'd bow their heads while they knelt beside their bed\nAnd we could hear them lift our names before the Lord\n\nMama prayed and Jesus stood beside us\nDaddy prayed and the devil had to run\nGod looked down, and his angels guarded through the harder days\n...\n\n", 
        "I would take no for an answer\nJust to know I heard You speak\nAnd I'm wonderin' why I've never\nSeen the signs they claim they see\nAre the special revelations\nMeant for everbody but me?\nMaybe I don't truly know You\nOr maybe I just simply believe\n\n'Cause I can sniff, I can see\nAnd I can count up pretty high\nBut these faculties aren't getting me\nAny close to the sky\nBut my heart of faith keeps poundin'\nSo I know I'm doin' fine\nBut sometimes finding You\nIs just like trying to smell the color 9\nSmell the color 9\n\nNow I've never felt the presence\nBut I know You're always near\n...\n\n", 
        "Tears are falling\nHearts are breaking\nHow we need\nTo hear from God\nYou've been promised\nWe've been waiting\nWelcome Holy Child\nWelcome Holy Child\n\nHope that you don't\nMind our manger\nHow I wish we\nWould have known\nBut Long-awaited\nHoly Stranger\n...\n\n", 
        "Every day is a journal page\nEvery man holds a quill and ink\nAnd there's plenty of room for writing in\nAll we do is believe and think\nSo will you compose a curse\nOr will today bring the blessing\nFill the page with rhyming verse\nOr some random sketching\n\nTeach us to count the days\nTeach us to make the days count\nLead us in better ways\nThat somehow our souls forgot\nLife means so much\nLife means so much\n...\n\n", 
        "Weak and wounded sinner,\nLost and left to die,\nO, raise your head for Love is passing by,\n\nCome to Jesus,\nCome to Jesus,\nCome to Jesus and live,\n\nNow your burden's lifted,\nAnd carried far away,\nAnd precious blood has washed away the stain... so\n\nSing to Jesus,\nSing to Jesus,\nSing to Jesus and live,\n\nAnd like a newborn baby,\n...\n\n", 
        "Lazy summer afternoon\nScreened in porch and nothin' to do\nI just kicked off my tennis shoes\nSlouchin' in a plastic chair\nRakin' my fingers through my hair\nI close my eyes and I leave them there\nAnd I yawn, and sigh, and slowly fade away\n\nDeep enough to dream in brilliant colors\nI have never seen\nDeep enough to join a billion people\nFor a wedding feast\nDeep enough to reach out and touch\nThe face of the One who made me\nAnd oh, the love I feel, and oh the peace\nDo I ever have to wake up\n\nAwakened by a familiar sound\n...\n\n", 
        "You think I'd have it down by now\nBeen practicin' for thirty years\nI should have walked a thousand miles\nSo what am I still doin' here, yeah\nReachin' out for that same old piece of forbidden fruit\nI slip and fall and I knock my halo loose\nSomebody tell me, what's a boy supposed to do?\n\nI get so clumsy, I get so foolish, I get so stupid\nAnd then I feel so useless\nBut You're sayin' You love me and You're still gonna hold me\nAnd that You wanna be near me 'cause You're makin' me holy\nStill makin' me holy, yeah\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Is our world spinning backwards?\nWhat has brought about this change?\nCan't you see that people aren't the same...\n\nI wish I were dreamin', and could wake up from my sleep\nAnd find us all the way we used to be...\n\n'Cause the love that used to be is dyin'\nIs anybody even tryin'?\nAnd I don't know how, I don't know why\nBut somethin' in my soul is cryin' (listen)...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Tears are falling\nHearts are breaking\nHow we need\nTo hear from God\nYou've been promised\nWe've been waiting\nWelcome Holy Child\nWelcome Holy Child\n\nHope that you don't\nMind our manger\nHow I wish we\nWould have known\nBut Long-awaited\nHoly Stranger\n...\n\n", 
        "On the surface not a ripple\nUndercurrent wages war\nQuiet in the sanctuary\nSin is crouching at my door\n(CHORUS)\nHow can I be so prone to wander\nSo prone to leave You\n...\n\n", 
        "Well you already know life ain't easy\n'Cause you've had more than your share of hard times\nBeen so long since you heard the sweet music\nOr seen the blue sky\n\nFeels like nobody knows how you're hurtin'\nAnd you've gotten so tired of hidin' your pain\nAnd you'd give anything to lay down your burden\nAnd just fly away\nOh, but don't go flyin' away\n\n'Cause I've got good news\nIt's water for the thirsty\nComfort for the weary\n...\n\n", 
        "On a hill far away stands a tall mighty tree\nWhere a boy and girl used to take turns pushing the tire swing\nI remember the pocketknife in hand\nAnd her name in my heart\nAnd thinkin' there ain't no way for a boy to contain\nThe love that he feels inside\nSo I carved her name into my tree\nThen I carved a heart around her name\nThen I carved an arrow through the heart\nJust to say \"I love you\"\n...\n\n", 
        "A purple sky to close the day\nI wade the surf where dolphins play\nThe taste of salt, the dance of waves\nAnd my soul wells up with hallelujahs\n\nA lightning flash, my pounding heart\nA breaching whale, a shooting star\nGive testimony that you are\nAnd my soul wells up with hallelujahs\n\nOh praise Him all His mighty works\nThere is no language where you can't be heard\nYour song goes out to all the Earth\n...\n\n", 
        "Grass is always greener on the other side\nThe search is never over in the pastures of my mind\nIs the meaning of happiness drowning in smiles\nOr that dreadful world I left behind?\nO Lord grant the grace to accept who I am\nWho I am, that You have designed\n\nI know there's a plan that you have up your sleeve\nRabbi, teach me the faith to believe\nIt's the only way my life will ever make sense to me\nOh, la-da-da, la-da-da, la-da-da\n\nI can never measure, 'cause better things are all around\n...\n\n", 
        "Was I the only one to notice\nThat human nature doesn't work that way\nThey tell me if I look deep inside me\nThat I can find my own way\n\nI only find a rebel and a fool there\nWho won't admit that he's afraid\nI thought I was holdin' on to freedom\nBut locked my soul up in chains\n\nI need a hero\nWho'll dare to find me\nFly to my rescue\n...\n\n"
