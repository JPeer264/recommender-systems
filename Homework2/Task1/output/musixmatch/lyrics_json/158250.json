        "We've tried so hard to understand\nBut we can't\nWe held the world out in our hands\nAnd you ran away\n\nIt takes some time to let you go\nAnd it shows\n\n'Cause all we know is falling, it falls\nRemember, 'cause I know that we won't forget at all\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell me where our time went\nAnd if it was time well spent\nJust don't let me fall asleep\nFeeling empty again\n\n'Cause I fear I might break\nAnd I fear I can't take it\nTonight I'll lie awake, feeling empty\n\nI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer now\nWe're better off without you\nI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer now\nWe're better off without you\n...\n\n", 
        "I think we have an emergency\nI think we have an emergency\nIf you thought I'd leave then you were wrong\nCause I won't stop holding on\nSo are you listening?\nSo are you watching me?\nIf you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong\nCause I won't stop holding on\nThis is an emergency\nSo are you listening?\nAnd I can't pretend that I don't see this\n\nIt's really not your fault\nThat no one cares to talk about it\nTo talk about it\nCause I've seen love die\nWay too many times\nWhen it deserved to be alive\n(when it deserved to be alive)\n\nAnd I've seen you cry\n...\n\n", 
        "So this is how it goes?\nWell I, I would have never known\nAnd if it ends today\nWell I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone\n\nNow I think we're taking this too far\nDon't you know\nThat it's not this hard?\nWell it's not this hard\nBut, you take what's yours and I take mine\nMust we go there?\nPlease not this time\nNo, not this time\n\nWell this is not your fault\nBut if I'm without you then I will feel so small\n...\n\n", 
        "And here we go again\nWith all the things we said\nAnd not a minute spent\nTo think that we'd regret\nSo we just take it back\nThese words and hold our breath\nForget the things we swore we meant\n\nI'll write you just to let you know\nThat I'm all right\nCan't say I'm sad to see you go\n'Cause I'm not\nNo, I'm not\nWell, I'm not\n\nAnd here we go again\nWith all the things we did\nAnd now I'm wondering\nJust who would I have been\n...\n\n", 
        "Maybe if my heart stops beating\nIt won't hurt this much\nAnd never will I have to answer\nAgain to anyone\n\nPlease don't get me wrong\n\nBecause I'll never let this go\nBut I can't find the words to tell you\nI don't want to be alone\nBut now I feel like I don't know you\n...\n\n", 
        "I've hoped for change\nIt gets better every day\nI've hoped for change\nBut still I feel the same\nThere's something wrong\n'Cause everybody knows\nThat we can do this on our own\n\nAnd we got everybody singing\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nAnd we got everybody singing\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Please speak softly\nFor they will hear us\nAnd they'll find out\nWhy we don't trust them\n\nSpeak up dear\n'Cause I cannot hear you\nI need to know\nWhy we don't trust them\n\nExplain to me\nThis conspiracy against me\nAnd tell me how\nI've lost my power\n...\n\n", 
        "And when we get home, I know we won't be home at all\nThis place we live, it is not where we belong\nAnd I miss who we were in the town that we could call our own\nGoing back to get away after everything has changed\n\nCould you remind me of a time when we were so alive?(Everything has changed)\nDo you remember that? Do you remember that?(Everything has changed)\nCould you help me push aside all that I have left behind?(Everything has changed)\nDo you remember that? Do you remember that?\nSo we stand here now and no one knows us at all\nI won't get used to this, I won't get used to being gone\n...\n\n", 
        "I am finding out that maybe I was wrong\nThat I've fallen down and I can't do this alone\nStay with me, this is what I need, please?\nSing us a song and we'll sing it back to you\nWe could sing our own but what would it be without you?\n\nI am nothing now and it's been so long\nSince I've heard the sound, the sound of my only hope\nThis time I will be listening.\nSing us a song and we'll sing it back to you\n...\n\n", 
        "Close your eyes and make believe\nThis is where you want to be\nForgetting all the memories\nTry to forget love cause love's forgotten me\n\nWell hey, hey baby, it's never too late\nPretty soon you won't remember a thing\nAnd I'll be distant, the stars reminiscing\nYour heart's been wasted on me\nOhhh...\n\nYou've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you\nMy little decoy\nDon't look so blue, you should've seen right through\n...\n\n", 
        "And if you're listening, I miss you.\nAnd if you hear me now, I need you.\n\nWhere did you go?\n'Cause you're not gone\nEveryone knows that something's wrong\nThe wires were cut and I'm alone\n\nI know we're getting closer\nI know you're coming back for me this time\nThis time.\n\nAnd do you ever want me, do you ever need me?\nI know that you left before goodbye.\nAnd it's okay, there's always another day.\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh star fall down on me\nLet me make a wish upon you\nHold on, let me think\nThink of what I'm wishing for\n\nWait, don't go away.\nJust not yet.\nCause I thought\nI had it.\nBut I forget.\n\nAnd I won't let you fall away\nFrom me.\n...\n\n", 
        "You say the sweetest things\nAnd I can't keep my heart from singing\nAlong to the sound of your song\nMy stupid feet keep moving\n\nIn this 4/4 beat\nI'm in time with you\nIn this 4/4 beat\nI would die for you\n(Die for you)\nSomeone stop this\n\nI've gone too far to come back from here\nBut you don't have a clue\nYou don't know what you do to me\n\nWon't someone stop this song?\nSo I won't sing along\nSomeone stop this song\nSo I won't sing\n\nI never let love in\n...\n\n", 
        "I slipped down the stairs\nTripped over your fragile ego\nI slid down the hallway\nRight into the web you'd woven\n\nAnd you never said\nThat you meant to save someone\nSomebody just like me\nAnd you never told me\nYou wanted to love someone\nSomebody just like me\n\nYou locked all the doors\nYou felt it was safer that way\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to be so quick, so clever\nI used to know myself much better\nAnyone can see that this is only permanent\nTemporary, it never hurts to try\n\nAnd it's all a game\nI know we'll stay the same\nBut repetition ends in failure\nAnd every time I see it in your eyes\nWhen repetition ends, we'll start over\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Too alarming now to talk it out\n\nTake your pictures down, shake it out\nTruth or consequence, say it aloud\nAnd use that evidence, and race it around\nThere goes my hero\n\nWatch him as he goes\nThere goes my hero\nHe's ordinary\nDon't the best of them\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I heard you driving in my car \nThen in a frozen bar\nAnd I claimed I didn't care for you\nBut your verse got trapped inside my head\nOver and over again\nYou played yourself to death in me\n\nI thought I'd drop you easily\nBut that was not to be\nYou burrowed like a summer tic\nSo you invade my sleep and confuse my dreams\nTurn my nights to sleepless itch\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hello, hello?\nIs anyone home?\n\nHello, hello?\nJust pick up the phone\nI opened up my life to you\nI told you everything I knew\n\nYou listened so closely to\nYou listened so close when love was just a way out\n\nBut you're going deaf now\nYeah you turned your head around\n\nHello, hello?\n\nIs anyone home?\nHello, hello?\nJust pick up the phone\nYou'll be sorry to hear\n\nI'm doing fine now\n...\n\n", 
        "And when it rains\nOn this side of town it touches everything\nJust say it again and mean it\nWe don't miss a thing\n\nYou made yourself a bed\nAt the bottom of the blackest hole\nAnd convinced yourself that it's not the reason\nYou don't see the sun anymore\n\nAnd oh, oh, how could you do it?\nOh I, I never saw it coming\nOh, oh, I need the ending\nSo why can't you stay just long enough to explain?\n\nAnd when it rains\nWill you always find an escape?\nJust running away\n...\n\n", 
        "Just talk yourself up\nAnd tear yourself down\nYou've hit your one wall\nNow find a way around\nWell, what's the problem?\nYou've got a lot of nerve\n\nSo what did you think I would say?\nNo, you can't run away\nNo, you can't run away\nSo what did you think I would say?\nNo, you can't run away\nNo, you can't run away\nYou wouldn't\n\nI never wanted to say this\nYou never wanted to stay\nI put my faith in you\nSo much faith\nAnd then you just threw it away\nYou threw it away\n...\n\n", 
        "No, sir\nWell, I don't wanna be the blame\nNot anymore\nIt's your turn, so take a seat\nWe're settling the final score\nAnd why do we like to hurt so much?\nI can't decide\nYou have made it harder just to go on\nAnd why?\n\nAll the possibilities\nWell, I was wrong\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\n\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\n\nI drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating\n...\n\n", 
        "Somehow, everything's gonna fall right into place\nIf we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday\nIf only time flew like a dove\nWill God make it fly faster than I'm falling in love?\n\nThis time we're not giving up\nLet's make it last forever\nScreaming, \"Hallelujah\"!\nWe'll make it last forever\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm in the business of misery\nLet's take it from the top\nShe's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock\nIt's a matter of time before we all run out\n\nWhen I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth\nI waited eight long months\nShe finally set him free\nI told him I can't lie he was the only one for me\n\nTwo weeks and we had caught on fire\nShe's got it out for me\nBut I wear the biggest smile\nWhoa, I never meant to brag\n\nBut, I got him where I want him now\nWhoa, it was never my intention to brag\nTo steal it all away from you now.\nBut god does it feel so good\n\nCause I got him where I want him right now\n...\n\n", 
        "And when it rains\nOn this side of town it touches everything\nJust say it again and mean it\nWe don't miss a thing\nYou made yourself a bed\nAt the bottom of the blackest hole\nAnd convinced yourself that it's not the reason\nYou don't see the sun anymore\n\nAnd oh, oh, how could you do it?\nOh I, I never saw it coming\nOh, oh, I need an ending\nSo why can't you stay just long enough to explain?\nAnd when it rains\n\nYou always find an escape\n...\n\n", 
        "What a shame\nWe all became such fragile, broken things\nA memory remains just a tiny spark\n\nI give it all my oxygen\nSo let the flames begin\nSo let the flames begin\nOh glory, oh glory\n\nThis is how we'll dance when\nWhen they try to take us down\nThis is what will be, oh glory\n\nSomewhere weakness is our strength\n...\n\n", 
        "I've gone for too long\nLiving like I'm not alive\nSo I'm going to start over tonight\nBeginning with you and I\nWhen this memory fades\nI'm gonna make sure it's replaced\nWith chances taken\nHope embraced\nAnd have I told you?\n\nI'm not going\n'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle\nAnd I'm not leaving\nI won't let you\nLet you give up on a miracle\nWhen it might save you\n\nWe've learned to run from\nAnything uncomfortable\nWe've tied our pain below\nAnd no one ever has to know\nThat inside, we're broken\n...\n\n", 
        "I got a lot to say to you\nYeah, I've got a lot to say\nI notice your eyes are always glued to me\nKeeping them here\nAnd it makes no sense at all\n\nThey taped over your mouth\nScribbled out the truth with their lies\nYou little spies\nThey taped over your mouth\nScribbled out the truth with their lies\nYou little spies\n\nCrush, crush, crush\nCrush, crush\n(Two, three, four)\nNothing compares to\nA quiet evening alone\n\nJust the one, two\nI was just counting on\nThat never happens\nI guess I'm dreaming again\nLet's be more than this\n\nIf you wanna play it like a game\nWell, come on, come on, let's play\n...\n\n", 
        "I am outside\nAnd I've been waiting for the sun\nAnd with my wide eyes\nI've seen worlds that don't belong\n\nMy mouth is dry\nWith words I cannot verbalize\nTell me why we live like this\n\nKeep me safe inside\nYour arms like towers\nTower over me, yeah\n\n'Cause we are broken\nWhat must we do to restore\nOur innocence\n...\n\n",
