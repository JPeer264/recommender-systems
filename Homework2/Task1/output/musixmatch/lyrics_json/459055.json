        "For once there is nothing up my sleeve\nJust some scars from a life that used to trouble me\nI used to run at first sight of the sun\nNow I lay here waiting for you to wake up\n\nThe city outside still sounds like it's on fire\nYou put on new sheets\nThe white flag of a Saturday night\nI know we stayed up talking in circles\nBut I like to think the symmetry\nWill keep me close to you\nFor everyone I'm out to prove wrong, you keep the light on\nThe only one, you know me better than the truth\nSo despite what I've done\nI pray to God that we can move on\n...\n\n", 
        "Give me a second, I\nI need to get my story straight\nMy friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State\nMy lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar\nMy seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar and\n\nI know I gave it to you months ago\nI know you're trying to forget\nBut between the drinks and subtle things\nThe holes in my apologies, you know\n\nI'm trying hard to take it back\nSo if by the time the bar closes\nAnd you feel like falling down\nI'll carry you home\n\nTonight\nWe are young\nSo let's set the world on fire\nWe can burn brighter than the sun\n\nTonight\nWe are young\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh oh\nThe barkeep's in a bad mood\nPlaying with his chains\nTalking 'bout a blood moon\nAsking how I found this place\nMy eyes are drained from the one that got away\nSo tonight I'm going out; tonight I'm gonna stay out\nIn walks lady long boots looking for a date\nI would make the first move but I'm too drunk to enunciate\nNever been one to wanna hear about someone's day\nSo tonight I'm going out; tonight I'm gonna stay out\nAnd it's so hard just to breathe\nThere's such a fine line between the things you want and the things that you need\n\nSo I'm not going to sleep\nSlippin' into midnight under harsh lights\nAnd nothing gets me down\nRunning into old friends; I don't need anymore\nTonight I'm gonna show them\nWe all got scars\nWe all got scars\nWe all got scars\nWe all got scars so what?\nI'm slippin' into midnight under harsh lights\nAnd nothing here is bringing me down\n...\n\n"
