        "It don't mean a thing\nIf it ain't got that swing\n(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah\nDoo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)\nIt don't mean a thing\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't care what the weatherman says\nWhen the weatherman says it's raining\nYou'll never hear me complaining\nI'm certain the sun will shine\nI don't care how the weather vane points\nWhen the weather vane points to gloomy\n...\n\n", 
        "Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,\nWarmer than the Summer night.\nThe clouds were like an alabaster palace,\nRising to a snowy height.\nEach star its own Aurora Borealis,\nSuddenly you held me tight,\nI could see the midnight sun.\n\nI can't explain the silver rain that found me,\nOr was that a moonlit veil?\nThe music of the uniaround me,\nOr was that a nightingale?\nAnd then your arms miraculously found me,\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll take romance\nWhile my heart is young and eager to fly\nI'll give my heart a try\nI'll take romance\n\nI'll take romance\nWhile my arms are strong and eager for you\nI'll give my arms their cue\nI'll take romance.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,\nCan't you see? Oh, you have captured me!\nBeing so glamorous, now can't you be amorous just with me,\nMake it soon, Cop a look at that moon.\n\nLove is just around the corner,\nAny cozy little corner,\nLove is just around the corner,\nWhen I'm around you.\n\nI'm a sentimental mourner,\nAnd I couldn't be forlorner,\nWhen you keep me on that corner,\n...\n\n", 
        "When I was a young man courting the girls\nI played me a waiting game\nIf a maid refused me with tossing curls\nI'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls\nWhile I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls\nAnd as time came around she came my way\nAs time came around, she came\n\nOh, it's a long long while from May to December\nBut the days grow short when you reach September\nWhen the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame\nAnd you ain't got time for waiting game\n...\n\n", 
        "When the mellow moon begins to beam\nEvery night I dream a little dream\nAnd of course Prince Charming is the theme\nThe he, for me.\nAlthough I realize as well as you\nIt is seldom that a dream comes true,\nTo me it's clear\nThat he'll appear.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The very thought of you makes my heart sing\nLike an April breeze on the wings of spring,\nAnd you appear in all your splendor,\nMy one and only love.\n\nThe shadows fall and spread their mystic charms\n...\n\n", 
        "At night when everything is quiet\nThis old house seems to breathe a sigh\nSometimes I hear a neighbor snoring\nSometimes I can hear a baby cry\n\nSometimes I can hear a staircase creaking\nSometimes a distant telephone\nOh, and when the night settles down again\nThis old house and I are all alone\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hush now, don't explain\nJust say you'll remain\nI'm glad you're back,\nDon't explain.\n\nQuiet, don't explain\nWhat is there to gain\nSkip that lipstick,\nDon't explain.\n\nYou know that I love you and what love endures\n...\n\n", 
        "Somewhere there's music\nHow faint the tune\nSomewhere there's heaven\nThere is no moon above\nWhen love is far away too\nTill it comes true\nThat you love me as I love you\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'\nWhy mess around with strife?\nI guess, I was cut out to step and strut out\nGive me the simple life\n\nIt must be pleasant, dining on pheasant\nUsing the proper knife\nI want tomatoes and mashed potatoes\nGive me the simple life\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,\nWarmer than the Summer night.\nThe clouds were like an alabaster palace,\nRising to a snowy height.\nEach star its own Aurora Borealis,\nSuddenly you held me tight,\nI could see the midnight sun.\n\nI can't explain the silver rain that found me,\nOr was that a moonlit veil?\nThe music of the uniaround me,\nOr was that a nightingale?\nAnd then your arms miraculously found me,\n...\n\n", 
        "The way you wear your hat\nThe way you sip your tea\nThe memory of all that\nNo, no they can't take that away from me\nThe way your smile just beams\nThe way you sing off key\nThe way you haunt my dreams\nNo, no they can't take that away from me\nWe may never, never meet again\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm a very ordinary man\nTrying to work out life's happy plan\nDoing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me\n\nWhen I find a very lonely soul\nSoon be-kinda-comes my only goal\nI feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy\n\nI want to be happy\nBut I won't be happy\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear music when I look at you;\nA beautiful theme of ev'ry\nDream I ever knew.\nDown deep in my heart I hear it play.\nI feel it start, then melt away.\n\nI hear music when I touch your hand,\nA beautiful melody\n...\n\n", 
        "Instead of making conversations\nMake love to me\nMake love to me, my darling\nWhile there is still a mood\n\nMust I extend an invitation\nTo make love to me\nMake love to me, my darling\n...\n\n", 
        "Somewhere there's music\nHow faint the tune\nSomewhere there's heaven\nThere is no moon above\nWhen love is far away too\nTill it comes true\nThat you love me as I love you\n...\n\n", 
        "When skies are cloudy and gray,\nThey're only gray for a day,\nSo wrap your troubles in dreams,\nAnd dream your troubles away.\nUntil that sunshine peeps through,\nThere's only one thing to do,\nJust wrap your troubles in dreams,\n...\n\n", 
        "Ev'rything is set, skies are blue,\nCan't believe it yet, but it's true,\nI'll give you just one guess,\nMy sweet Lorraine said \"Yes;\"\nWaiting for the time, soon to be,\nWhen the bells will chime merrily,\n\n(I'm so happy,)When it's raining I don't miss the sun,\nFor it's in my sweeties smile,\nJust think that I'm the lucky one\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday you came my way,\nAnd when you smiled at me,\nIn my heart I felt a thrill you see,\nThat it was love at sight and\nI was right to love you as I do.\nStill I never dreamed that you could love me too.\n\nYour eyes of blue, your kisses too,\nI never knew what they could do.\nI can't believe that you're in love with me.\n\nYou're telling ev'ry one I know\nI'm on your mind each place we go\nThey can't believe that you're in love with me.\n...\n\n"
