        "Breathe...\nHelp me breathe\nI'm shoulder deep in water\n\nUse...\nUse me like you want\n'Cause I just wanna feel\n\nAnother drop\nAs time goes by\nI wait for you\n\nIf we lose this moment\n...\n\n", 
        "Watch me passing through\nYour odd dimension\nYou're standing there\nCarrying the cross that I gave\n\nI'm a northern light\nThe stars above you\nI whisper your name\nOh, feeling strange\n\nYou're falling down from grace\nAnd feeling kinda strange\nIt's not over\nYou're falling down from grace\nAnd feeling kinda strange\nIt's not over\n...\n\n", 
        "First you said that you would never leave me\nMerry were my days\nThen you told me life is never easy\nAnd left without a trace\n\nBut how come I want you\nLike the soil yearns for the rain\n\nWon't you light up, won't you light up my life\nLet my soul breathe\nTell me wrong tell me right\nYou're my mind cage\nLike a mountain far away\nYou were always there\nDressed in summer white\n...\n\n", 
        "\"All that you see or seem, is but a dream within a dream\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Move slowly\nBeyond the colors of my eyes\nMove slowly\nInto the corners of my mind\nRising like the Pegasus\nEach and every one of us released\nIslands in the sea of dreams\nAlways searching harmony and peace\n\nAll we find\nReject our mind\nDon't you wonder why\n\nIf the war by heavens gate released desire\nIn the line of fire someone must have known\nThat a human heart demands to be admired\nCause in the Center of the Universe\n...\n\n", 
        "Winter's close and the mountain high\nI'll start my journey now\nOn this planet we call Earth we belong\nI want to know\nWhy did god make me feel there is more to be answered\nMaybe god cannot remedy our souls if he tried\n\nI seek peace of mind at least and to know I did my best\nI will pray for those I have loved\n\nI must take your farewell\nCarried by destiny\nBound to obey\n\nI must take your farewell\nTrails of discovery\nLead me an ocean away\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sleepless\nNot really quite awake\nWhere the soul conforms to deeper needs\nFree within frames of custody\nI revolve my spirit and exhale\n\nOn the edge of paradise\nPoison burning in my veins\nUnavailing... compromised\nMy dreams remain the same\n\nSoothing but yet so violent\n...\n\n", 
        "I recall one summer's night\nWithin the month of June\nFlowers in mahogany hair\nAnd smell of earth in bloom\nOnly such a melody\nComes without a sound\nMore than faintly heard by those\nWho know what they have found\nNow it's just a memory\n\nSilently we wander\nInto this void of consequence\nMy shade will always haunt her\nBut she will be\nMy guiding light\n\nSilently we wander\nIn search of truth and confidence\nSo many hopes were lost here\nAlong the way\nFrom morning to night\n\nMeet me by the wishing well\n...\n\n", 
        ":\nSpeak my friend\nYou look surprised\nI thought you knew\nI'd come disguised\nOn angel wings... in white\nI can make\nYour dreams come true\nWhat a couple...\nMe and you\nOn journey through the night\n\nI will show you everything so vividly\nYou can't deny me\n\nBathed in moonlight\nI'm proclaimed by angels cry\nThink well\nDo take your time\nBecause your soul\nWill be mine the day you die\n...\n\n", 
        "Everyone is here, the feast can soon begin\nVanity we celebrate, my favorite of sins\n\nChandeliers so grand that heaven sees the shine\nAnd my friend declares, everything I look at could be mine\nIt's a miracle, life till now has been a waste\nYou have proved to me, by your hand I'm truly graced\n...\n\n", 
        "I&#39;m breathless Need I say something? How did you find me here? You, of all who have crossed my path unexpectedly ... from where I&#39;m dreaming Keep close tomorrow may be gone This is the time to believe ...", 
        "Helena you came to me\nWhen seemingly life had begun\nLittle did I know then\nWhere this would go\nWhen this begun\nOnce I was free to fly\nI never promised anything\nThis may well be goodbye\n\nDon't ask why\nDon't be sad\nSometimes we all must alter paths we planned\nOnly try -- understand\nI want to save you\nFrom the lost and damned\n\nAlthough you hold me close\nI feel retention arise\nJust as a hint of fear\n...\n\n", 
        "[HELENA:]\nI remember a song\nFrom long ago\nSome of the pieces\nThey remind me of you\nHow could I know\nYou were to leave me\n...\n\n", 
        "They call me The Wild Rose\nBut my name was Eliza Day\nWhy they call me it I do not know\nFor my name was Eliza Day\nFrom the first day I saw her I knew she was the one\nShe stared in my eyes and smiled\nFor her lips were the colour of the roses\nThat grew down the river, all bloody and wild\nWhen he knocked on my door and entered the room\nMy trembling subsided in his sure embrace\nHe would be my first man, and with a careful hand\nHe wiped at the tears that ran down my face\nThey call me The Wild Rose\nBut my name was Eliza Day\n...\n\n"
