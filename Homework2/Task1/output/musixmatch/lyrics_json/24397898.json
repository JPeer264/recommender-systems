I'm guilty I reckon cause I hear that good\nShit can hurt baby's brains\nHeard he was normal 'til three and then he stopped talkin'.

Told her I'm sorry for causin' her pain\nCausin me pain?\nCausin me pain?\nShe asked again and then grabbed my right hand\nAsked am I crazy. Said look here, baby. I release you from all of your sins and your shame\nCause I've been redeemed\nI found in Christ\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "You know I get loose, I'm a screw turned pro status\nNever did shit but inflict this damage\nNever met a word that I wouldn't like a weapon just brandish\nWalk away clown boy, vanish\nFeelin' outlandish, chemicals soaked in my cabbage\nFace numb, face off rap shit, straight no chasing that dragon\nCess to the breast plate, raised where the stakes break badness\nGet a tracheotomy tap for talkback shit\nSlow clap, do the running man, back flip\nLight a flare in the road, I'm an accident\nLimping into the light I'm off axis\nWe got 808s to make cats piss, right on the rug where the cat sits\nBy the time this recording gets heard I'll be gone\nWith the dough from the jar plus mattress\nLeft a note on the fridge with a frowny face drawn\nWith a rope from its neck to the rafters\nNot the most subtle way to explain\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Penny ante your bets up\nAny sanity left (nah)\nAny chance for humanity's landing on who's the next up\nHope we handed 'em ammo enough to work from the neck up\nThose who handling damage control don't wish us the best luck\nI'm a living in smoke type\nFloating with a grin over the moat type\nHarry Allen on you bitch, I believe no hype\nCloser to the edge than even we want to admit\nIf this don't go right\nThen assholes like myself are proven so right\nAll I got is this rap shit\nAll I want is a castle\nAnd to move like a man with a minimum of harassment\nThe company of women with opinions and fat asses\nThat's my list of demands\nYou don't answer them, get the Gatling\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Now come over here and let me give you a tongue kiss on your hot pocket...\n\nMe and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes\nPut your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced\nCaught the ghost when I was yay high so today I stay way high\nDo not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life\n\nThis is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe\nA hit of this, a kid with Tourette's will chill out and act right\nI'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike\nThey suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes\n\nI slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes\nHumblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (get it?)\nI'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two\nThey say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick'll do\n\nI'm so Rakim and Eric B\nBitches check out my melody\nI might Slick Rick on a fella (foul), catch me a felony\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "That was me in BK on Atlantic\nNever looked both ways, ran in traffic\nPops went away but I stayed, vagrant\nPlaced where the steel and cement became nature\nLove what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous\nCityscape where the blood of good men courses\nAnd the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain\nTake a knee to the gods and get horse shit\nWanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it\nGot a bevy of imps to spit hatred\nShit'll get in your head and cause panic\nHave you desperately begging to get famous\nGet your dignity dirty and left orphaned\nSanity on the fringe of distorted\nWho are they to just take shit and hoard it?\nWho am I that I don't get my portion?\nThe most impressionable minds get molested and informed by manipulating forces\nDon't fret little man, don't cry\nThey can never take the energy inside you were born with\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
