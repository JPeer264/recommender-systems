        "I can say waiting on my troubles\nI believe, I've gone stronger than before\nI have dreams, so many had been answered so let them be\nAm not asking anymore I still search for that satisfaction\nThat the battle is won, when I found my faith and the place I belong\n\nBut until that day I'll be walking on to another place\nJust drift along, till I find somebody\nWho'll be my guide, make me feel alive\nWill take me as I am, and that's when I'll know I found my destination\nWhoo-oo, who'll take me as I am and never let it go and be my inspiration\nOo girl!! be my inspiration\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes life can be a burden\nTryna stay one step ahead\nI feel the world upon my shoulder each time\nI'm standing out on the edge\n\nAnd my hopes have all deserted me\nLike they washed away in the sand\nAnd it's hurting my pride, tryna survive\nBut I know I stand a chance\n\nWhen you lay your hands\nOh yeah\n'Cause it's the only thing I have that still makes sense\n\n(Oh baby, when I'm calling out)\nGive me love and affection\nKeep telling me, show me the way\n\n(Oh, if you see me falling down)\nLift me up from the shadows\nWill you take me away to a better place?\n\n(And when I'm in my darkest hour)\nYou're by my side to turn the tide\nUntil the suffering fades\n\nWhen life is getting me down\nGetting me down, I'm close to defeat\nCome and lay your hands on me\n...\n\n",
