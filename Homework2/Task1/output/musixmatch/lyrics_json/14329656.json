        "All I know, all I know is\nThat my heart aches from time to time\nHaven't you, haven't you been\nReading the questions in my mind\nWe don't have to speak\nWe don't have to try\nJust be easy\nJust be easy\nWe don't have to show\nWe don't have to hide\nJust be easy\nLet it down, let it down now\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey.\nDid I ever leave your mind?\nIts been too long since we last spoke and said good bye.\n\nHey.\nWas it when I held your hand?\nDid I ask you what you you'd do with??\nI wanna love you, til I feel okay.\nI wanna kiss you, again and again.\nI wanna hold you, hold you tight.\nOoh baby, you slow down time.\n\nHey.\n...\n\n", 
        "In the beginning\nI never thought it would be you\nWhen we were chilling\nSmiling in the photo booth\nBut we got closer (yeah)\nSoon you were eating off my spoon\nYou're coming over\nAnd we would talk all afternoon\n\nTonight we'll just get drunk\nDisturb the peace\nFind your hands all over me\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a photograph\nLife keeps spinning around faster than the thoughts in my head\nand I'm so lost with my head up in the clouds and both my feet up of the ground\nI'm not coming down I'll be here a while\nI'm not coming down no not for a while\nSo won't you stay, stay, stay\nStay for the night\nSo won't you stay, stay, stay\nUntill the morning light\n...\n\n", 
        "Every time, every time I wake\nI see your face\nEvery night, every night and day\nYou leave without a trace\n\nBaby let me love you down\nAnd it might last awhile\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby I love you,\nBaby oh,\nBaby I love you,\nBaby oh,\nBaby oh.\n\nBe there seconds flat,\nJust tell me where you at,\nEverywhere you wanna go,\nI will gladly follow.\n\nThat mean's he don't need to know,\n...\n\n"
