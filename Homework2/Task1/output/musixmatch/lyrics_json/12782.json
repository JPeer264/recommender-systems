        "I think I need a change of scenery, warm water\nSunshine on my foot, just like my daydream\nAnd on the nightly, everything is hot and sticky\nBut it's ok, cause no one plans to sleep here anyway\n\nBecause we all want a better life, I think I found it in this place\nEverthing is so sublime, you should come with me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
