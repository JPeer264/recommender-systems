        "This is the time, this is the moment we shine, the moment we climb\nThere's moments in life where we follow, we fly but I'm still trying to find that sky\nLooking for a reason to listen to me\nLet me just give you some pieces of me\nLet me just take out my heart that maybe you'll see that I'm not Superman that I really do bleed\nMan I'll give you that thing that repeats in your car\nBut I'll give you that music to heal every scar\nLook to the sky and I pray to the stars, find out that myself I've been trapped in the dark\nAnd I know what it is that I'm here to do\nIs this really the person I'm supposed to be?\nTrying to give you all my story but I can never find the words cause I don't know me\nI'm happy, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm mad and it's all because of this past\nWhen every kid in your school believes you can do it but really thinks that you're trash\nWhen you got friends that say, \"we'll always be there\"\u2026 I look around, where you at?\nIt's like you all got up and left; onto the next\nWhat was my chance to pack?!\nPutting in effort but I should've known better but being alone is just nothing but pressure\nThrough my endeavors I'm piecing this letter to every kid trying to hold it together\nThis life is just long, and I'm just from the street\nEven the strongest of man will fall weak\nBut with all the pain and the hurt, the tears on your shirt\nThat's what finding happiness means\nAnd now you probably think I got this all down\nBut I don't even know what I'm doing right now\nWhen you're giving your best till your last breath\nThere's a time where you just want to drown\nPicked up myself from the cold hard ground\nFriends don't believe what I'm doing right now\nTeachers telling me to pull all this right down\nGot this whole time to turn this whole life around\n...\n\n"
