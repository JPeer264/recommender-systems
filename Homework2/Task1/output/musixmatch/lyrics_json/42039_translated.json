        "(Bob Dylan)\n\nI've seen love go by my door\nIt's never been this close before\nNever been so easy or so slow\nBeen shooting in the dark too long\nWhen something's not right it's wrong\nYou're gonna make me lonesome when you go\n\nDragon clouds so high above\nI've only known careless love,\nIt's always hit me from below.\nThis time around it's more correct\nRight on target, so direct,\nYou're gonna make me lonesome when you go\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When we want to love, we love\nWhen we want to kiss, we kiss\nWith a little petting, we're getting\nSome fun out of life\n\nWhen we want to work, we work\nWhen we wanna play, we play\nIn a happy setting, we're getting\nSome fun out of life\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(Elliott Smith)\n\nDrink up, baby\nStay up all night\nThings you could do\nYou won't but you might\n\nThe potential you'll be\nYou'll never see\nPromises you'll only make\nDrink up with me now\nAnd forget all about\nPressure of days\nDo what I say\n...\n\n", 
        "Every night he'd come to me\nI'd cook for him, I'd pour his tea\nI was in my thirties then\nHad made some money, lived with men\n\nWe'd lay us down to give and get\nBeneath the white mosquito net\nAnd since no counting had begun\nWe lived a thousand years in one\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin\nDance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in\nLift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove\n\nDance me to the end of love\nDance me to the end of love\n\nLet me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone\nLet me feel you moving like they do in Babylon\nShow me slowly what I only know the limits of\n\nDance me to the end of love\n...\n\n", 
        "From bad luck I'm walking away\nI'm not getting stuck\nI'm not gonna stay\n\nTo good things I'm moving ahead\nI'm tired of dying\nI'm living instead\n\nOnce in a while I wake up\nWondering why we gave up\nBut once in a while\nComes and it fades away\n\nThe sun's up and lighting the sky\nI never could see it\n...\n\n",

        "The summer wind\nCame blowing in\nFrom across the sea\nIt lingered there\nSo warm and fair\nTo walk with me\nAll summer long\nWe sang a song\nAnd strolled on golden sand\nTwo sweethearts\nAnd the summer wind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There's perfume burning in the air\nBits of beauty everywhere\nShrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt\n\nShe comes so close\nYou feel her then\nShe tells you No and No again\nYour lip is cut on the edge of her pleated skirt\nBlue Alert\n\nVisions of her drawing near\nArise, abide, and disappear\nYou try to slow it down\nIt doesn't work\n\nIt's just another night I guess\n...\n\n", 
        "Everybody's Talkin'\"\n\nEverybody's talkin' at me\nI don't hear a word they're sayin'\nOnly the echoes of my mind\n\nPeople stopping, staring\nI can't see their faces\nOnly the shadows of their eyes\n\nI'm going where the sun keeps shining\n...\n\n", 
        "From bad luck I'm walking away\nI'm not getting stuck\nI'm not gonna stay\n\nTo good things I'm moving ahead\nI'm tired of dying\nI'm living instead\n\nOnce in a while I wake up\nWondering why we gave up\nBut once in a while\nComes and it fades away\n\nThe sun's up and lighting the sky\nI never could see it\n...\n\n", 
        "You gas her up\nYou're behind the wheel\nYour arm around your sweet one\nIn your Oldsmobile\nBarrelin' down the boulevard\nLooking for the heart of Saturday night\n\nGot paid on Friday\nYour pockets are jingling\nYou see the lights\nYou get all tinglin', 'cause you're cruising with a six\nLooking for the heart of Saturday night\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Every night he'd come to me\nI'd cook for him, I'd pour his tea\nI was in my thirties then\nHad made some money, lived with men\n\nWe'd lay us down to give and get\nBeneath the white mosquito net\nAnd since no counting had begun\nWe lived a thousand years in one\n\n...\n\n"
