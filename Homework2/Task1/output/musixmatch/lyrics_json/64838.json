        "My heart's filled with loneliness and pain\nLying in my lover's arms,\nI hear him breathe and I can feel\nThe beating of his heart\n\nHis hand caresses my skin\nAnd he whispers words of love\nHe's sleeping in my arms and I can feel\nLoneliness in my heart\n\nHe only reminds me of you\nSo I do all the things with him\nFor such a long time\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't weep\nJust see\nCome here\nCall me\nJust follow\nNo sorrow\nYou're there\nWhere you belong\n\nIt's where you belong\nDon't you see\n...\n\n", 
        "Schwere Tr\u00e4nen\nVergebens geweint\nRinnen wie Silber\nIn Sehnsucht vereint\n\nVerlassen und traurig\nGeh' ich durch die Nacht\nDer Wind folgt mir nach\nUnd tr\u00f6stet mich sacht\n\nHart wie Stein\nUnd still ist mein Herz\nIch kann's nicht mehr f\u00fchlen\nVorbei ist der Schmerz\n\nIch hab es geschworen\n...\n\n", 
        "Each night I lie in my bed\nAnd I think about it\nOh my dark friend\nCan you give me an answer\n\nThe people that we love\nWe cannot understand\nEvery day the people that we love are hurt\nThe people who we love\nAnd cannot understand\nWe cannot understand\n\nDo you believe we're the children of a God\nDo you believe\n...\n\n", 
        "Nebel zieh'n gespentisch vor\nDer Sucher setzt leis seinen Fuss\nEinsam unterm Sternenzelt\n\nRastlose Suche in der Nacht\nWandelnd zwischen Schlaf und Tod\nNach einem Schattentraum\n\nFurcht und Sehnsucht\nFolgen sinem Weg\nIm Dammergarten scheint ein fahles Licht\n...\n\n", 
        "Past the hamlet\nThe soft orphan gleans some scanty ears\nHer eyes graze roundly and golden in the dusk\nAnd her lap waits for the heavenly groom\n\nHow sad this evening is\nHow sad this evening is\nHow sad this evening is\nHow sad\n\nI'm a shadow far away of sinister villages\nI drank God's silence of the grove's well\n\n...\n\n", 
        "What did you do\nYou're guilty\nYou have to die\nWe'll find you\nEverywhere\nVengeance\n\nWhy do you torture me\nMy mind is in despair\nWhy do you punish me\nFor a crime I never committed\n\nWhy am I all alone\nNo one who hears my crying\nWhy do you want to kill me\nFor a crime l never committed\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Out of the darkness you came\nYou looked so tired and sad\nI asked where you've been\nYou answered your voice was quiet\nOut in the cold searching for love\nI said you don't have to search for love\n\nCome to me, come to me\nRest your head on my shoulder\nCome to me, come to me\nSleep in peace\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm a lonely stranger\nIn this world of pain\n\nIn my darkest hour\nI'm alone\nWhy did you leave me\n\nBut one day\nI will find you\nMy heart and soul\nMy only love\n\nWandering through the fields\nOf disease\n...\n\n", 
        "A child is born\nOut of the womb of a mother\nWho didn't want it\nIt happened in a night\nOf drunken passion and no thought\nAbout the consequence\n\nTwo bodies cling together\nDrunken loneliness\nTwo bodies cling together\nBlind passion\nTwo bodies cling together\n\n...\n\n",

        "Es geschah in der Zeit,\nAls die Sonne die Erde zum Gl\u00fchen brachte\nUnd die Menschen sich nach der Nacht sehnten,\nNach den Schatten\nUnd der Linderung ihrer Qual:\n\nDie Luft steht stickig still\nDie Erde in der Hitze bebt\nKein Windhauch lindert die Qual\nSchweiss rinnt von der kalten Stirn\nFieber tobt im weissen Leib\nKein Windhauch lindert die Qual\n...\n\n", 
        "Come calm my anger\n\nOur love is like a perfect sky\nDeep blue and the sun is shining\nBut it seems that sometimes\nThere have to be some clouds\n\nAnd suddenly I feel this destructive anger\nDeep inside\nAnd suddenly I feel this destructive anger\nIs about to rise\n\nPlease come and calm this anger\nYou're the one to calm this anger\n...\n\n", 
        "He took my soul\nTook my soul\nIn his hands\nMy mind got dark\nMind got dark\nIn his hands\n\nWhen did I begin\nTo follow the shadows\nThey fill my dreams with pain and sadness\nWhen did I begin\nTo feel the sorrows\nThen I laid my soul into your hands\n...\n\n", 
        "Peel off my skin, make me helpless\nTaste my body\nLet me die in your sweet embrace\n\nI never thought that I could find\nSomeone like you and still\nI feel the union of souls\nI never thought that I could find\n...\n\n", 
        "Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain\nYour cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul\n\nYou have never learnt\nTo leave your prison\nYour heart lies in chains\nAnd who will break them\nYour heart lies in chains\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Soviel Zeit und soviel Leid\nSklave der Unendlichtkeit\nGefangen im K\u00e4fig deines Ichs\nEinen Ausweg siehst du nicht\nSoviel Zeit und soviel Streit\nVerdammt in Bitterkeit\nKetten aus Stahl, die brichst du nicht\nVerbirg dein Angesicht\n\nDie Zeit\nRinnt dir durch die H\u00e4nde\nDie Zeit\n...\n\n", 
        "I was walking through the night\nSuddenly I remarked a sound in the winds\nAn angel like voice singing a tale\n\nThrough the cold and stormy night\nFlies an angel\nThe black angel\nWhite skin, red lips and long black hair,\nHer wing is broken\n...\n\n", 
        "Why can't I hear you breath\nWhy can't I hold you now\n\nYou just told me on the phone\nBad news I can't believe they're true\nFate is so cruel to you it seems\nIt caught you at your weakest point\nNothing left of your whole world\nBesides chaos and smoking ruins\nYou thought there's nothing more to lose\n...\n\n", 
        "The long summer\nHas gone\nThe autumn leaves\nStart to fall\n\nYesterday I was touched by the breath of winter\nHis cold fingers searched for my heart\nBut in my heart I felt the warmth of this summer\nSo the first snowflakes melted away\n...\n\n", 
        "Are you missing me?\nNot knowing where I am\nOut there somewhere\nDo you remember me?\n\nDo you think of me?\nWhen you are on your own\nDo you wish that we\nHad the chance to meet?\n\nNever met you\nSearching my roots\nLack of identity\nSearching a proof\nAre you the one\nSearching my roots\nGive me a sign\nSearching a proof\n\nI hope that you'll agree\nSometimes we will meet\nAnd you'll tell me your reasons\nFor giving me away\n\nA day so long ago\n...\n\n"
