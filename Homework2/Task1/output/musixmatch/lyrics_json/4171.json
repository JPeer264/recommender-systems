        "I see a red door and I want it painted black\nNo colors anymore I want them to turn black\nI see the gods walk by dressed in their summer clothes\nI have to turn my head until my darkness goes\n\nI see a line of cars and they've been painted black\nWith crosses and my love never to turn back\nMost people turn their heads and quickly look away\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
