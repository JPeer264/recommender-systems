        "There was a place, a little town\nWhere we used to play and laugh around\nWe went too far, reaching for that star\nAnd the light moved away from me\n\nAnd the spirit never died, the world belongs to me\nThis is when I've been given time to live and see\n\nI'll never give up, never give in\nWon't stop believing, 'cause I'm gonna win\nSing with my soul before I get old\n'Cause there may be no tomorrow\nThere is no limit to what can be done\nClimbing the mountain with power so strong\nDusty roads, down the way\nLeaving the future behind me\n\nI got a fast car like a rock star\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
