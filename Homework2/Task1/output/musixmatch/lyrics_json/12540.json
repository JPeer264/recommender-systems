        "Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat and gets caught\nThese broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost\nIn trying so hard to look away from you\nWe followed white lines to the sunset\nI crash my car everyday the same way\n\nTime to let this pass\n(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)\nTime runs through our veins\n(it starts and stops and starts and stops again)\nWe don't stand a chance in this threadbare time\n(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)\nTime to let this pass\n(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)\n\nStaring at the setting sun\nNo reason to come back again\nThe twlight world in blue and white\nThe needle and the damage done\n\nI don't want to feel this way forever\nA dead letter marked return to sender\n\nBroken watch you gave me turns into compass\nIt's two hands still point to the same time 12: 03, our last goodbye\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "With fists raised high in tightened knots\nthe room explodes and now this blood is on your hands\nand there's no time for a second chance\nto paint my face with blood and tears and cover up\nAn open book that no one reads\nA misspelled word that no one knows\n\nYou stole the rain\nand then you turned around and tore my life in two\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "In this blackout inertia will hold our thoughts\nAnd the exit sign offers no light to see by\nCan we cast our shadows alone in the dark\nI can't see without you\n\nwhen the world is crashing down,\npart with it, start again,\nwhen the world is crashing down,\nthese notes will fold themselves,\nstanding at the margin's edge\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Lets call this the quiet city\nwhere screams are felt as the waves of the stoplights\nDrive through the streets\nas gunshots punctuate the night\nThe sides we take divide us from our faith\nand the mourning dove gets caught in the telephone wire\n\nAsleep you set the fire in your own house\nand the night was a knife the cut\nand I'm paralyzed\n\nCross out the eyes, blur all the lines\nTearing this canvas from the wall\nCross out the eyes, put lines through these cries\nPulled all the leaves from the trees that fall\n\nYeah trees that fall, trees that fall, trees that fall, fall\n\nA silent dance that we did into this hospital bed\nhear voices from another room:\n\"It happens all the time\"\nBut July in the sand then\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Now it's time\nTo wrap our fears in the night\nAnd on the first day\nI'll dress this city in flames\nAfter the things you say\nYou hate me for being this way\n\nStill you won't let go (of old ideals)\nThere is no headline (to read at night)\nWhen the record skips (and you're not)\nHolding the needle\n\nWe all sing the songs of separation\nAnd we watch our lives\nBleed out through our hands\nThat's how it was on the first day\nWhen we saw Paris in flames\n\nRain, rain down\nI think it's gonna rain, rain down\nI think it's gonna rain, rain down\nI think it's gonna rain\nI think it's gonna rain, rain down\nI think it's gonna rain, rain down\nI think it's gonna rain, rain down\nI think it's gonna rain\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Tuesday wakes up silent and there aren't enough pills to sleep (cut out)\nLike a miswired short wave radio\nIt's over but nothing can change to make this right (try again)\nWhen you live in a nightmare, its written all over your face\n\nAnd in a short time\nYou're never the same again\nThe distance is streamlined\nbetween decision and defence\n\nDistorient the senses, loss of identity\nNo one to trust, no one to trust\n\nLife runs through this trade\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "In this room, I'm sitting by your side\nCause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook\nStanding on the edge, casting lots to set me up\nBefore you knock me down\nOff the summer's edge and drown me\nWe're betting on our own lives\nMaking up for all the time we lost\n\nIn this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades\n(One breath, one step, could knock it all down)\nBut you lead with your eyes and you give it away\n(Decide, Design, to cut from the clouds)\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
