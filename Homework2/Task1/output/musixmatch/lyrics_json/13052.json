        "I learnt to fly like an Indian Myna\nI remembered being left alone\nShe rushed ahead and I followed behind her\nWhen all I wanted was to go back home\n\nThat's why that storm that's ragging\nIt might ask nice but sometimes it takes you by force.\nI still don't know, if I should intervene.\n...\n\n", 
        "Everything is saying eat me drink me everywhere I look\nTryin\u2019 to reel in the biggest catch but I barely have a hook\nWhat\u2019s the point of speculation I want to feel it in my hands\nThat thing that livid ancient spark in primordial man, yeah\n\nOnce upon a time I was a reptile and somewhere I still am\nI tend to act so civilized just because I can\nBut what about the secret that you whispered to me when you were high\nWhen you were young the doors were open but the moment passed you by\n\nAll I want is your pointless beauty\nEverybody is trying to explain\nAll I want is your pointless beauty\nI can\u2019t remember my name\nAll I want is your pointless beauty\nSo pretty with you I might explode\n...\n\n", 
        "Well you're real pretty\nAnd you act like a cross between you know what I mean\nIt's a real pity\nCause you try to be mean, but you just can't fake it with me\nYou love the Pixies\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't need you 'round here\nI wash my hair\nOf all your pain\nIt's not enough\nThat you think you're tough\nAnd all that girl stuff\n\nDon't feel sorry for yourself\nNo one else does\n...\n\n", 
        "I know you feel pretty beat\nYou're wanting to sleep\nI know your eyes getting sore\nYou've been up since three\nThe time's come to sleep\n\nIf you wanna crash out\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll cross your path\nYou won't let me forget it\nYou can change your name\nAnd make me remember it\n\nAnd they think that you're too much for words\nBut they don't know how to show it\nThey've labeled you most likely to succeed\nThough you don't know how they'd know it\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You know you never change your ways\nAnd I don't mean the way you brush your hair\nYou know you never change your ways\nAnd I don't mean the clothes you wear\n\nAnd I don't want you to lose your inhibitions\nJust be a bit more flexible\nBy dictionary definition\nBe a bit more ductile like me\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey let's not pretend that\nWe're not on each other minds\nYou'll always be with me\nEven if I'm doing time\nIn the 7-11 of my soul\nIt's got everything to do with rock n roll\nYou're my Red slurpee\nYou're my Red slurpee\n\nWhy can't they understand\nI don't like blue\n...\n\n", 
        "It's not just my body\nIt's where I keep my heart\nAnd that's mostly its difference\nFrom any other part\n\nAnd you wonder why\nI hide it like I do\nAnd you wonder why\nI treat it like I do\n\nSure I want a sun tan\nEven though it'll hurt\nBut I can't take the vulnerability\nWhen I take off my shirt\n\nAnd it's not 'cause something\nSomeday you once took\nAnd it's really not to do with how I look\n\nI'm just so scared\nYou'll see the true me\nOr worse maybe\nRight through me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Gegetta, the conqueror of Rome\nWe bow to you Gegetta, call Italy your own\nWe beg of you\n\nIt's been said when in Rome\nDo as the Romans do\nBut instead the Latin dog is gonna be\n\nAs unforgettable\n...\n\n", 
        "Has it come down to a choice?\nJust to choose, it feels so nice\nI've seen the best of me\nNow don't use it against me\n\nOn one hand you were beautiful\nOn the other so was I\nA motel of the happy\nEven only one night\n\nTo gently place your hands in mine\nAnd tell me that your life was fine\nMeet me soon and if you're late\nI promise that I'll try to wait\nI promise that I'll try to wait\n...\n\n", 
        "My turntable is so cool\nIt knows exactly what to do\nThe Stooges sound like they're in my room\nIt plays The Fall right out-of-tune\n\nPaid 50 bucks for it the other day\nAt a garage sale 'round the way\nIt plays records how they are meant to be played\nCan't picture any other way\n\nAnd it's black\nAnd it's cool\nAnd it knows just what to do\nI wouldn't swap it for the world\nIt's my turntable\n...\n\n", 
        "I wanna be a kid\nYou can nearly do everything\nYou can only not drive a car\nI wanna be a kid\nYou can even bungee jump\nWhen you are a kid\n\nAnd I don't wanna wanna wanna wanna wanna wanna Get old\nAnd I don't wanna wanna wanna wanna wanna wanna Get old\n\nI wanna be a kid\n'Cause when you're a kid\n...\n\n", 
        "Well you're real pretty\nAnd you act like a cross between you know what I mean\nIt's a real pity\nCause you try to be mean, but you just can't fake it with me\nYou love the Pixies\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't live without your breath\nYou are all that I adore\nI'd say if you were the sun, I'd be the rays\nBut I don't think that's a suitable metaphor me\n\nHow can that be?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I pretend I'm mellow\nSo you don't think I'm hurt\nI'm just a real sad fellow\nPretends he's so down to earth\n\nAnd I might get a kiss\nIf I play my cards right\nDon't care if I've missed\nThe whole goddamn point\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I saw you on the catwalk\nNot a corny supermodel song\nI tried to cheer, but the cat had my tongue\nYou came out of the dressing room\nIn a t-shirt with a red front\nI'll be your hanger-onner\nIf that's what you want\n\nCause I'm with the star\nCause that's what you are\nA beautiful star\nI'm with the star\nAm I speaking too soon if I say I'm in love\nI'm with the star\nCause that's what you are\nA beautiful star\nYou're wasting your pretty face\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you resent me\nIf I said that I'd miss you\nAnd would you hate me\nIf I wanted to kiss you\nAnd would you love me\nIf I was stoic\nAnd if I told you\nWould you already know it\n\nWell I'm coping better than before\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll cross your path\nYou won't let me forget it\nYou can change your name\nAnd make me remember it\n\nAnd they think that you're too much for words\nBut they don't know how to show it\nThey've labeled you most likely to succeed\nThough you don't know how they'd know it\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Well she talks like a bullet\nAnd she looks like a goddess\nSays she's a traveler\nAnd she knows where she's going\n\nDresses like a model\nTalks like a liar\nShe sounds like a bimbo\nBut she thinks like a scholar\n\nShe's got me she's lost me\n...\n\n", 
        "Shoulda seen that girl on the radio\nMade me think of the time\nI tried to rhyme\nAnd failed miserably that time\nOn the radio\nPassed the time\n\nShoulda seen me trying to talk to you\nSo you'd think I was cool\nBut I'm not\nAnd I guess you found that out\nOn the radio\nPassed the time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Things seemed so nice for the first few weeks\nDidn't care - she didn't notice me\nThen I asked her does she wanna hang out\nGet something to eat\n\nShe said I'm just another guy with high hopes\nA real sorry sight\nI'm also half her height\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll buy a pair of jeans\nA stylish means\nA groovy masterpiece\nI'll cover them with paper men\nAnd books on zen\n\nRecords shot with darts\nTalk your way out of this one - blah, blah, blah...\n\nI wrote a song for you\n...\n\n"
