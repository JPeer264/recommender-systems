        "Oh, how i wish i could drag you down here,\nPull these feet far from the ground\nBecause this, this city ain't no friend of mine\nAin't no friend.\n\nAll I can do\nWhen the tracks stop at the final destination\nIs just push on through,\nThe weariness and silences of such a crowded situation here.\n\nAll I can do\nWhen every brick, every bar, every elegance i see, i see her face,\nIs just push on, just push on through,\n...\n\n", 
        "I saw red and yellow flowers outside over the moors yeah\nThe brightest sunrise ever to have touched my eyes\n\nAnd through it all,\nI stood and stumbled, waded through my thoughts and heart\nYeah through it all,\nI fooled and fumbled, lost to the poet's frown.\nI fought the wolves of patience just to let it lie down.\n\nSee these waters they'll pull you up,\nOh now if you're bolder than the darkness.\nMy my, let these songs be an instrument to cut,\nOh spaces 'tween the happiness and the hardness.\n...\n\n",
