        "Yang Yang holds on to a giant phone\nYang Yang's soft voice goes on and on\nI hate you, I hate you, where did it go wrong?\nYang Yang goes talking to himself on the phone\n\nYang Yang sends his men pebbles and stones\nYang Yang rips his women down to the bones\nI own you, I own you, so give us a song\nYang Yang goes talking to his world on the phone\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "(Wetton/Downes)\n\nBuildings burning, blazing in the night\nSearchlight sweeping, lazer beams of light\nDesolation, smoke has filled the sky\nSiren wailing, who can hear my cry?\nSo the darkness leaves me never\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
