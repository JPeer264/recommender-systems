        "Woke up in a cold sweat\nIn the middle of the night\nSeems like a lifetime\nWhen you're wondering who's wrong or right\nOne confession would resurrect the truth\nRevenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you\n\nNow we dance with the devil down lonely\nstreet, lonely street\n\nLooking for a window in the house of tears\nLiving in hell, I pray the rain disappears\nI'm headed for a breakdown\nAnd the fever runs higher\nAs I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey mister can you tell me\nWhat this world's about\nIt might just help me out\nI used to be a dreamer\nBut my dreams have burned\nYou know how luck can turn\n\nSometimes it's hard to find a\nfriendly face\nFeel like a stranger to the human race\nIt's such a lonely, lonely place\n\nI walk alone in the darkness of the city\nGot no place to call home\nI might be dyin'\nBut you can't hear a sound\n'Cause midnight rain is comin' down\nI'm just a stranger, a stranger\nin this town\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Growing up today\nThere's many mountains you must climb\nYou're not the only one\n'Cause everybody's on that line\nHey mister know it all\nWhat do you recommend\nYou think you know the answers\nBut the questions never end\n\nYoung hearts better hold on\nBeyond the innocence\nYour youth is gone\nSo look in your mirror\nYou got nothing to lose\nDon't waste your time away\nThinkin' 'bout yesterday's blues\n\nBorn outta passion\n...\n\n", 
        "All alone in the dark\nNo walls or windows\nTrying hard to define\nHeaven from hell\nStanding out in the rain\nWith just one shadow\nNothing to see or believe\nBeyond myself\nSee my life going by\nEach moment I am alive\nI keep reaching out, holding on, hoping\n\nSomewhere in my life\n...\n\n",
