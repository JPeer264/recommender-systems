        "One fat, tumbling time we graced the Gold Share\nSpent like dimes, saved in the hat on an old man's head\n\nTrapped like rats, Cornered by the flood\nWe built a raft and we floated\nSave for the tricks And the endless lies\nIt could be liked for its motives\nIt could be liked for its motives but...\n\nI'd rather be crushed,\n...\n\n", 
        "Your silver tongue laughs at the clowns of our age\nA slow production line of cheap-shots from both sides\nShot from the hip to my seventh rib\nA spoiled tomato lies in all that you say\nAnd I was the last of us to know\n\nSound the alarm for my sentimental ways\nHave come in view and we've all got our own knives\n...\n\n",
