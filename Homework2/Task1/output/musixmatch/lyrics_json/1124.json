        "Words get tangled on your tongue and you stumble on your feet\nWhen you miss somebody\nAnd everywhere you think you see them walking down the street\nWhen you miss somebody, oh yeah\nWhen you miss somebody\nYou tell yourself a hundred thousand times\nNobody ever lives forever so you give it one more try\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
