        "Now let me start this, if home is where the heart is\nWith her I feel at home even when we're apart it's\nStrange but I can feel her presence beside me\nSo in a sense one could say that she guides me\nNow I'm remembering the first time I saw her\nFeeling this vibe, or whatever, let's say aura\nBut I never would have thought, see I never could have known\nOutta one chance glance all this could have grown\nAnd that's the beauty of it you see it grows and it's natural\nWhat can I say in every way we're compatible\nTalk is cheap at times we don't speak\nCos we're engrossed in thoughts that are deep\nIt's like two hearts, two minds, two bodies, two souls\nMaking one whole, now it's gotta be told\nThat what we have is more than just physical\nDon't be so cynical, we got a spiritual love\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
