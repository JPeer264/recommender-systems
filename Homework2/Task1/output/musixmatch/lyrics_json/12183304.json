        "I found a box of memories,\nRead a letter,\nDropped a tear where you signed your name,\nAnd turning the page,\nSmearing the ink into \"Love Always.\"\n\nGirl, I always start this way a\nNd then I end up in a bottle screaming out your name,\nPunching the walls, carrying on like I've gone insane,\n\nAnd in the mirror,\nI can see the man who just shook his head with no remorse,\nWatching an angel cry her tears,\nStepping over my beers as you walked out the door.\n\nAnd there ain't nothing like a memory,\nWhen it's coming on strong like a hurricane.\n...\n\n",
