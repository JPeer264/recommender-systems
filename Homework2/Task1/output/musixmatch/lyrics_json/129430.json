        "Visions of gold that we'll soon obtain\nVisions of gold that we'll soon obtain\nSo removing this daily struggle is my only aim\nThough when Obama was elected we witnessed some change\nBut I guess that's wishful thinking 'cause it's still the same\nOr maybe worse than never, I let you decide\nAsk me my positioning, I reply I'm black inside\nJust letting you know where my loyalty resides\nYoung, black and lifted getting lifted\nSo they labeled us misfits but we barely some mystics Showed you magic in the flesh, yes\nThey compare me with these dudes but I feel like I'm the best\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "You're under the blue sky\nWondering why a silly old question\nA silly old question\nDon't walk on the tight rope\nSo never look down\nSee your reflection\nCould dance on the clouds\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
