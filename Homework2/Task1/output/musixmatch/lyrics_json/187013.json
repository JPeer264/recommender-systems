        "I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\nTryin this on for size, grow up broke,\nstanding in the cold with a hole in your coat\nStay next door to a woman that smoke a whole pack cigarettes\nwith the a hole in her throat\nMy mama in church, high off hope, my uncle in trap, my aunt on dope\nmy cousin went to school so she could be a writer, met a nigga with some money and thats all she wrote\nAnd here I am, running these streets\ntryin to find a bit of my identity\nMeanwhile every other nigga I know gettin money ridin in a drop top like Kennedy\nF*cking with the young girls I like I could be a hater\nBut it ain\u0092t my right, I could go and f*ck with the big booty girl\nBut the whole hood hit her and she ain\u0092t my type\nI came from the bottom, like it or not\nThey'll put a gun to you if they like what you got\nAnd they might break, but they don\u0092t bend, they don\u0092t talk that\u0092s not the trend\nBut that\u0092s not news, so ya'll don\u0092t know, it ain\u0092t yo boat so ya'll don't row\nYou gotta pay attention to be up on this and why would ya'll ever pay what ya'll don't owe.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
