        "Alone again again alone\nPatiently waiting by the phone\nHoping that You will call me home\nThe pain inside my love denied\nHopes and dreams swallowed by pride\nEverything I need it lies in You\n\n'Cause I'm broken\nYou know I need You now\nDeep inside I'm broken\nYou see the way I live\nI know, know Your heart is broken\nWhen I turn away\nI need to be broken\nTake the pain away\n\nYeah\n\nI question why You chose to die\nWhen you knew your truth I would deny\n...\n\n", 
        "Lately I've been wandering\nOff the narrow path\nYou've given me so many things\nThat I've never had\n\nAll in all I know it's you\nThat always pulls me through\nIf you reach deep inside\nYou'll see my heart is true\n\n'Cause I hate the way I feel tonight\nAnd I know I need you in my life\nYes, I hate the way I feel inside\nAnd I promise to make the sacrifice, yeah\n...\n\n", 
        "When I look into your eyes\nI see a lot of hate\nPushing me away\nYou're haunted by a past\nA past that brings you down\nSo you throw it all away\nAgain\n\nJust try to find a place deep within your soul\nAnd don't deny the child living deep inside\nOpen your eyes and find\nThis life's better than you know\nIt's in your hands now\nJust open up your eyes\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In my eyes you see the pain\nWith each lie I take the blame\nWith each sigh I slowly fall away\n\nYou are there when I need you\nYou sew me up when I bleed through\nThe endless cloth of lies surrounding me\n\nEverything that I am you have given me\nThe lessons that I've learned are bringing me home\nIt's everything that I need\nIt's all the truth that I believe\nRight where I need to be\nJust bring me home\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I need you to feel exactly like I do inside\nBut I feel so alone again\nI try to find a better life\nSomewhere far away from here\nBut I need you to believe in me\n\nBut I won't be afraid\nJust because you don't need me\nI will not be ashamed\nJust because you don't believe in anything that I say\nNow I turn and I walk away from you\n\nI won't fade away\nI won't fade away again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear the words you say to me\nI see the way you look at me\nI know what's on your mind\nSo stand up, get up, back up now\nJust stay away\n\nI know the fear you hold inside\nI know what's weighing on your mind\nThere's nothing you can do\nSo stand up, get up, back up\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Every morning as I wake to another day\nI bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray\nI search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find\nRunning circles in the mazes deep inside my mind\nYou always take me to a higher level\nShow me something that's deep inside\nYou show me things I never knew\n\nYou push me you pull me\n\nYou set my soul on fire\nYou take me so much higher\nHigher again\nThank you for it all\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm reaching out without a sound\nMy pride falls to the floor again\nInside my mind I search to find\nA place just to call my own\n\nDeep inside your eyes\nI am blinded by your love\nStill I run so far just to find that\nI'm alone again\n\nIn my head\nI hear you calling me\nAnd I can't run 'cause there's nothing left for me\nWhen I fall you always follow me deep inside\nDeep inside\nDeep inside of my head\n...\n\n", 
        "As he raises his hand you begin to understand\nThat no love is worth the hate that you feel\nNow you're running out of pain\nAnd all these feelings feel the same\nSo you close your eyes and wish it all away\n\nAnd I lie awake and I try to say\nAnything I know just to ease your pain\nBut you hide away where no one can see\nAnd it's only you that can set you free\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Some say, I need you now\nExactly where I go where I am when I die\nSome say, that I'm not sure\nwhat lies on the road ahead this time\nLay me down, \u2018cuz I know...\nHeaven is my home\nI am not alone\nIn my heart I know\n...\n\n", 
        "You've gone too far\nToo far apart\nI know it's hard to see\nThrough the pain\nYou gave it all\nHe broke your heart\nBut I will still be here\nAnd I promise you\n\nIf I could be everything to you\nI would find a way\nI would find a way\nIf I could prove you felt the same\nI would be the one\nI would be the one\n\nIf I could\nI've held this in\n...\n\n", 
        "Little eyes see through me again\nThey know all of my sin\nAs I try to hide it away\nAgain\nAnd I know that you're there\nAnd I see how much you care\nBut I throw it all away\nAgain\n\nWhat I really know\n\nSay you need me\nWhen I'm far away\nSomething I hold\nDeep inside of me\nWhen I'm alone\nI pray that you can see\n...\n\n",
