        "Bravely I look further than I see,\nKnowing things I know I cannot be, not now.\nI'm so aware of where I am, but I don't know where that is,\nAnd there's something right in front of me and I...\n\nTouch the fingers of my hand\nAnd I wonder if it's me\nHolding on and on to Theories of prosperity\nSomeone who can promise me\nI believe in me\n\nTomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be\nTime has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me\nNothing in this room but empty space\nNo me, no world, no mind, no face\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
