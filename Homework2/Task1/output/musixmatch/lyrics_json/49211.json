        "I don't wanna rush this thing\nI don't wanna jump the gun\nI really wanna say those three little words\nBut I'm gonna bite my tongue\n\nYeah, I'm just gonna lay on back\nLeave it on cruise control\nI'm gonna hold it all inside\nTill the right time comes down the road\n\nChorus:\nI got a feelin'\nMy head's a reelin'\nMy heart is screamin'\nI'm about to bust loose\nBottled up emotion\nIt's more than a notion\nIt starts with an \"I\"\n...\n\n", 
        "I prefer the fiddle to the violin\nAnd I tend to think that supermodels are too thin\nAnd I think who you are is who you oughtta be\nBut that's just me\n\nThe best of Andy Griffith was in black and white\nFishin' still beats workin' if you never get a bite\nAnd coffee's kinda pointless without caffeine\nBut that's just me\n\n...\n\n",

        "Well, we know it ain't the first time\nWe know it used to be my past time\nAnd a couple of weeks back we agreed\nThat was gonna be my last time\nBut I guess that night I plumb forgot\nWho's runnin' this show and who's not\n\nOh, I musta been off my rocker\nI musta got some wires crossed\nTo come in here claimin' that from here on out\nI'm gonna be the boss\nOh, it musta been me the big talker\nHad a little too much Johnny Walker\nSo let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Walk A Little Straighter\nBilly Currington\n\nI remember lookin' up to look up to him.\nAn' I remember, most the time he wasn't there.\nI'd be waitin' at the door when he got home at night.\nHe'd pass me by to go pass out in his chair.\n\nAn' I'd say: \"Walk a little straighter, Daddy,\nYou're swayin', side to side.\nYour footsteps make me dizzy,\nAnd no matter how I try,\nI keep trippin' an' stumblin'.\nIf you'd look down here, you'd see:\nWalk a little straighter, Daddy,\nYou're leading me.\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, here we are again\nMe and my friends on a Friday night\nWaitin' on Jimmy\nHe's always gotta get his hair just right\nBobby yells. \"Where we gonna go?\"\nOh, you'd think by now he'd know\n\nWhere the girls are\nWhere the fun is\nWhere the heads get turned and games begin\nMight get you a name and a number\nKiss and a hug\nWhere the girls are\n\nPile three in my truck\nThe rest follow us, and we'll head downtown\n...\n\n", 
        "Daily grind is stealin' me away again\nWhen I just wanna lay back down\nAnother night gone and don't know where it went\nWhat I need more than anything right now is\n\nTime with you, more time with you\nTo laugh and talk and play and make more love to you\nOh, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do\nThan spend time with you\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a summer breeze floatin' cross the water\nSofter than a whisper on my skin\nI can't begin to tell you how it moves me\nIt's so intense, I burn within\n\nWhen she gets close to me\nMy emotion break free\nAnd I just wanna hold on to her permanently\nIt's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt\nIt's unbelievably heavenly\nWhen she gets close to me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The red Georgia clay when mixed with the rain\nSure made for one nasty mess\nAh, but we were ridin' high in that old truck of mine\nIn deep as we could get\nAlways looking for a rut, tryin' not to get stuck\nAnd slinging that mud everywhere, growin' up down there\n\nMe and my friends where the deep river bends\nHad a long rope tied to a tree\nTakin' turns on the swing, takin' turns takin' drinks\nAnd I don't mean iced tea\nA good buzz later playing chicken with the gators\nWay too young to be scared, growin' up down there\n...\n\n", 
        "So, there's somewhere you gotta be\nWell, I sure hate to see you leave\nI'll break my grip, but babe, you need to know\nNext time I might not let you go\n\nI know what you said\nAnd I wanted that too\nBut takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do\nIt's feelin' more and more like forever\nHoldin' you close\nAnd next time I might not let you go\n...\n\n",
