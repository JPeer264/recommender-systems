        "Words and music by roddy frame\n\nLove is sleepwalkin'\nCoppin' unworldly sights\nSearchin' and stoppin'\nBangin' the world to rights\nCan't let kilometres\nOr colours defeat us try\nFor something so sweet\nWe'll never be beat\n...\n\n", 
        "Words and music by roddy frame\n\nWell, when I've questioned\nAll I could and come undone\nAnd only sadness stands\nBetween me and the sun\nWhen loving leaves and leaves me\nWaiting on the one\nAnd my heart can't hide\nAnd when seduction separates\nMe from surprise\nI open my eyes and\nI let your love decide\nI let your love decide\n...\n\n", 
        "Once I was happy in happy extremes\nThese bitter tokens are worthless to me\n\nSo you appear and say how I've grown\nFill me up with faces I've known.\nIn this light they're far from divine\nI'll save them up and spend them when I have time.\n\nThe salted taste of all your tears and woes\nSent me in haste my melancholy rose\nThose tasteless lips were closed\nYou watched me come, you'll see me go.\n\nOnce I was happy in happy extremes\n...\n\n", 
        "From the mountain tops\nDown to the sunny street\nA different drum is playing a different kind of beat\nIt's like a mystery\nThat never ends\nI see you crying and I want to kill your friends\n\nI hear your footsteps in the street\nIt won't be long before we meet\nIt's obvious\nJust count me in and count me out\nAnd I'll be waiting for the shout\nOblivious\n\nMet Mo and she's okay\nSaid no one really changed\nGot different badges but they wear them just the same\nDown by the ballroom\n...\n\n", 
        "Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there.\nChill will wake you, high and dry\nYou'll wonder why.\n\nWe met in the summer and walked 'til the fall\nAnd breathless we talked, it was tongues.\nDespite what they'll say, it wasn't youth, we'd hit the truth\n\nFaces of Strummer that fell from your wall\nAnd nothing was left where they hung\nSo sweet and bitter, they're what we found\nSo drink them down and\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I get up, and nothing gets me down.\nYou got it tough. I've seen the toughest around.\nAnd I know, baby, just how you feel.\nYou've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real\nOh can't you see me standing here,\nI've got my back against the record machine\nI ain't the worst that you've seen.\nOh can't you see what I mean?\nMight as well jump. Jump!\n...\n\n", 
        "Craze my hair and shine my shoes\nAnd kiss the kiss that I could lose\nAnd I looked at what I have\nAnd I have one wish\nAnd I looked back in your eyes\nAnd there were two words\nBackwards and forwards\n\nHere lies the essence of my peers\nHandshakes, hellos and golden years\n...\n\n", 
        "It's called love\nAnd every cruelty will cloud it\nAnd his lie, his lie\nTrue love could never allow it\n'Cos it's a lie that we have ceased to believe\nWe've said goodbye but it won't take its leave\n\nWhy should it take the tears of a woman\nTo see how men are\n\nP. E. R. S. P. E. C. T. I. V. E.\nIt's no mystery\nWhat you don't know always gets you\nIt will hurt you and desert you\n...\n\n", 
        "Summer in the city where the air is still\nA baby being born to the overkill\nWell who cares what people say\nWe walk down love's motorway\n\nAmbition and love wearing boxing gloves\nAnd singing hearts and flowers\n\nBut somewhere in my heart\nThere is a star that shines for you\nSilver splits the blue\nLove will see it through\nAnd somewhere in my heart\nThere is the will to set you free\nAll you've got to be\nIs true\n\nA star above the city in the northern chill\nA baby being born to the overkill\nNo say, no place to go\nA TV, a radio\n...\n\n", 
        "Jock's got a vote in parochial\nTen long years and he's still got her\nPaying tax and and doing stir\nWorry about it later\n\nAnd the wind blows hot and the wind blows cold\nBut it blows us good so we've been told\nMusic's food 'til the art-biz folds\nLet them all eat culture\n\nThe past is steeped in shame\nBut tomorrow's fair game\nFor a life that's fit for living\nGood morning Britain\n\nTwenty years and a loaded gun\nFunerals, fear and the war ain't won\nPaddy's just a figure of fun\nIt lightens up the danger\n\nCorporal sneers at a Catholic boy\nAnd he eyes his gun like a rich man's toy\nHe's killing more than Celtic joy\n...\n\n",

        "I'm in love with everything that breaks the grip of caution\nOn our getting up and leaving for a bigger day, still some say\nThat all you need is money to be free from what is poor\nWell that's the lie of looking up from somewhere down\n\nBecause the sun will show to testify that all the\nTime between belongs to you and I, to be still on fire\nAnd when the strongest words have all been used\nAnd all the new ones sound confused, to be still on fire\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Stuck in my beat suede shoes I can't wait\nOh what a state to be in\nI need her heart and get a jack-jones for my sins\n\nShe's gonna ditch that shining sick machine\nAnd be speeding straight my way\nBut I'm churning in neutral\nTurning in a circle\nJust like the USA\n\nThe secret is silver, it's to shine and never simply survive\nAnd don't swallow substitutes and never see second prize\nCos I know that my might could change my mind\nAnd I'm told that by rights its not my find\n...\n\n", 
        "I recall the biggest beach\nThrowing stones\nAlmost alone except for something just outside of reach\nAnd I'd swear I wouldn't say\nAnd then I'd paint me up into a scene\nAnd throw me like a party which had\nCome and stayed and left and been\nAnd had still refused to end\n\nAnd if your head is happy\nAnd your heart's insane\nI'll take you there\nWhen you throw your thunder\nAnd you snap my reins\nI'll make you care\n...\n\n", 
        "My eyes are stuck on sleepless dreams\nThis world is never what it seems\nWe've sold it short, it's what we're taught\nLost it in the living\n\nAllegiance is the strangest thing\nIt's grown too fast, grown some wings\nIt's flown away, flown away\n\nThe back door to heaven is open wide to me\nSo when I'm wrapped up tight in the hell of the night\nCan I still decide to be where the, the mad road goes\n'Neath the shapeless glow?\n\nOr will we swop ourselves like children\nFor the value of our innocence?\n...\n\n", 
        "Tears\nJust like the jewels adorn their corporate crown\nWeigh on me worthless\nAnd I shake them down and leave now\nAnd have no royal things\n\nYou\nWould consecrate the ground I paced in pain\nAnd though those pavements\nCaught your sorrow stains,\nThey fall from me and I say\nMaybe don't fall for anything\nThat says it's never gonna give you everything.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Craze my hair and shine my shoes\nAnd kiss the kiss that I could lose\nAnd I looked at what I have\nAnd I have one wish\nAnd I looked back in your eyes\nAnd there were two words\nBackwards and forwards\n\nHere lies the essence of my peers\nHandshakes, hellos and golden years\n...\n\n", 
        "I feel the magic that our time has traced\nMake a point of it in every place\nBut every place deserves a curse or two\nFor making me so far away from you\n\nI saw some pictures of the world at war\nCouldn't suss what all the fuss was for\nI wear a picture of you wearing black\nAnd kissing me behind the butlers back\n\nSometimes I get down\nBut it's not you that gets me down\nIt's just that sense of the impossible\nGratuitously handed down\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a child could have the trigger\nAnd the best man needn't fall\nTo understand that heaven\nCould be any place at all\n\nJust five colours set in motion\nAnd I try again to place it\nAnd it features are obscure\nEverytime I turn to face it\n\nBut I still chase it\n\nOh its twists are cruel and hopeless\nLike neglet has worn it thin\n...\n\n", 
        "Craze my hair and shine my shoes\nAnd kiss the kiss that I could lose\nAnd I looked at what I have\nAnd I have one wish\nAnd I looked back in your eyes\nAnd there were two words\nBackwards and forwards\n\nHere lies the essence of my peers\nHandshakes, hellos and golden years\n...\n\n", 
        "I brought you some francs\nFrom my travelling chest\nYou'll spare me the thanks\n'Til you know I'm the best\n\nSo, come Hogmonay\nWhen love comes in slurs\nResolutions I'll make\nAnd you can label them hers\n\nWe threw our hands up high\nWe nearly touched the sky\nWe clicked our heels and spat and swore we'd never let it die\n\nAll those boy wonders\nSold their medals when they saw this train\n...\n\n", 
        "You said you're free, for me that says it all\nYou're free to push me and I'm free to fall\nSo if we weaken we can call it stress\nYou've got my trust, I've got your home address\nAnd now the only chance that we could take\nIs the chance that someone else won't make it all come true\n\nWe're making tracks that show our touch and go\nAnd now it's touch and come, and you should know\nBut then four years won't mean that much to me\nWhen I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed\n\nJust close your eyes again\nUntil these things get better\nYou're never far away\n...\n\n"
