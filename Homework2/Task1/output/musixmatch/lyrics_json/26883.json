        "I'm walking in darkness with no shadows\nTears fall in silence with no sound\nI've got to let go of visions I've outgrown\nEven I know\nSo let the rain come down\n\nBring down the moon\nThe mythic and mighty that fall when you lean\nBring down the moon\n\nBuilding love on thin air and dreams\nPerfect love is a desperate creed\nAnd one that we all try to believe\nSo bring down the moon\n\nI'm finding some comfort in closing the distance\nBetween my life and my dreams\nOoh, if love's not forever I need to discover\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
