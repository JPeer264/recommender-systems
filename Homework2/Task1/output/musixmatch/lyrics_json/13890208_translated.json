        "I live in this country now\nI'm called by this name\nI speak this language\nIt's not quite the same\nFor no other reason\nThan this it's my home\nAnd the places I used to be far from are gone\n\nYou've travelled this long\nYou just have to go on\nDon't even look back to see\nHow far you've come\nThough your body is bending\nUnder the load\n...\n\n", 
        "I made a small small song\nmade a small small song\nI sang it all night long\nAll through\nThe wind and rain\nUntil the morning came\n\nThis song is my small song\nThis song is my small song\nI sang it all night long\n...\n\n", 
        "Why don't you ask me\nHow long I've been waiting\nSet down on the road\nWith the gunshots exploding\nI'm waiting for you\nIn the gloom and the blazing\nI'm waiting for you\n\nI sing like a slave I know\nI should know better\nI've learned all my lessons\nRight down to the letter\nAnd still I go on like this\nYear after year\nWaiting for miracles\nAnd shaking with fear\n\nWhy don't you answer\nWhy don't you come save me\n...\n\n"
