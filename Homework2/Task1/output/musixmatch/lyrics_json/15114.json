        "To the east of Java back in eighteen eighty three\nStood a peaceful island basking in the sea\nNo one knew the danger lying deep beneath the earth\nThat Mother Nature's victim would sooth the monsters birth\nKrakatoa\nThe earth was spitting thunder with a deadly roar\nWhen the dust had settled Krakatoa was no more\nWith a scream of fury the power was released\nThe biggest known explosion the world had ever seen\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",

        "One life I'm gonna live it up\nI'm takin' I said I'll never get enough\nStand tall I'm uh, young and kind of proud\nI'm on the top, but as long as the music's loud\n\nIf you think I'll sit around as the world goes by\nYou're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die\nOut there is a fortune waiting to be had\nIf you think I'll let you go you're mad\nYou've got another thing comin'\nYou've got another thing comin'\n\nThat's right here's where the talking ends\nWell, listen, this night there'll be some action spent\nDrive hard callin' all the shots\nI got an ace card comin' down rocks\n\nIf you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain\nListen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again\nOut there is a fortune waiting to be had\nIf you think I'll let it go you're mad\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "What is this place across the fields\nWhere poppies stretch and sway\nIn Flanders, days of war are gone\n\nBut memories will remain\nComrades of their different coats\nCame to fight and die\nFrom all sides they stood and fought\nAnd fell beneath the sky\nWhere is this land where I am now\nA million spirits cry\nA generation loved and lost\nNever asking why\nIt didn't matter much at all\nTo the generals how you died\nBut to your families back at home\nYou were heroes side by side\nThe unknown soldier never known\nA cross to mark your grave\nBut we remember what you did\nIn our hearts you will remain\nWhere is this land where I am now\nA million spirits cry\nA generation loved and lost\nNever asking why\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I'll be leaving down that road again tomorrow\nI don't know when I'll be back again\nThere's a feeling in my heart that I must follow\n\nWhen I leave you all behind I feel the pain\n\nThis is our world\nIt's who we are\nYou wouldn't have me change a thing\nBefore we go just let me know\nWill you be with us to the end\n\nMany more have walked this path before us\nI hear their voices whisper in the wind\nThe piper plays the tune and we must follow\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",

        "Come worship at the metal church\nLet your voices rise as one\nStand before the barricades\n\nPrepare yourself for what's to come\nThese walls will resonate tonight\nTo the sound of screaming hordes\n\nDecibels will rise above\nTo fill this concert hall\nAre you ready to begin\nThen let the hammer fall\nLike a battering ram\n\nThese walls will turn to dust tonight\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
