        "Somewhere in this universe of lost forgotten dreams\nThe silence weaves a tapestry of once enchanted themes\nThe shadows listen carefully and question what it means\n\nFor stories have lives of their own\nBut what good's a story whose end is unknown\n\nStay with me\nFor the little night that's left to be\nFor a moment in a memory\n...\n\n", 
        "Here on this night\nBehind walls made of stone\nWhere no one can enter and\nThe dark dreams alone\n\nBut now someone's entered\nThe walls are defied\nThe shadows they watched\nWhile the dark sympathized\n\nBut there in the silence\nThere in the silence\nThere in the silence\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you see commissar\nThe night is darker\nDo you think commissar\nTheir dreams are starker\nDo you hear commissar\nThe night is breathing\nCould it be commissar\nWe should be leaving\nNow before the curtain\nDoes come crashing down\n\nDo you hear commissar\nThe night is silent\nDo you think commissar\nIt is defiance\nDo you see commissar\nThe mob has faces\nCould it be commissar\nThe dark embraces\n...\n\n", 
        "As the steam from the street starts to rise\nThe gutter whispers\nThat the moon like a child has arrived\nThe dark has missed her\n\nAnd the light that she lends is a guide\nAmong her shadows\nLike the ghost from the past that survive\n\nAnd you ask me now\nWhat is my intent\nHere among the ruins\nCloaked in false pretence\nAnd how do I belong\n\nI seek power\nWhere the power remains\nI seek power\nIn the back of your brain\n...\n\n", 
        "Wheels keep turning\nBlind desires\nCore ambition\nNever tires\n\nGot an engine\nGot intentions\nNo dissensions\nNothing to hide\n\nGotta' mission\nStreet munitions\n\nAny road block\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a thief on a summer's night\nAcross an ocean\nWho sees another's life fading away\n\nAnd of this life he writes\nWithout emotion\nThen pushes it from sight\nSomewhere faraway\nTo a distant land\nEvery tear betrayed\nAnd never makes\nAnd never makes\nAnd never makes\nAnd never makes a stand\nMakes a stand\nLord there's something wrong\nMakes a stand\n\nCould a star's forgotten light\nA child's devotion\nEmbrace eternal night\nIn shallow graves\n\nAs we watch from distant heights\nNo breath or motion\nStill every ghost must haunt in its own way\nSleep beneath my dreams\nSafe within my hands\nWhere I never under\nNever under\nNever understand\n\nLord there's something wrong\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Jesus\nWhat's the reason\nFor these scars that will never heal\nHearts that no longer feel\nEyes that can no longer see\n\nJesus\nWhat's the reason\nFor this child that will not survive\nWith all her dreams inside\nCould she mean nothing to thee\n\nAnd jesus please tell me if you can recall\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a man that I used to know\nAnd sometimes he still visits with me\nWhen it's late and the alcohol's glow\nIs nearly gone\nAnd it's time to awaken\n\nAnd he looks and he laughs at the sight\nAnd he asks what has happened to me\nAnd I blame it all on the lights\nBut he smiles and says i'm mistaken\nAnd there is no use in disguising\nWhat the eye can so clearly see\nThat i've spent my whole life denying\nThat the man in the mirror is me\n\nGive me one second chance\n...\n\n", 
        "When in your life did you surrender\nLate in the night do you remember\n\nWhat were the dreams that you betrayed then\nWould you go back if you could save them now\n\nDid you believe there was something more\nWaiting behind some forgotten door\nOr was that all long before\n\nYou felt the pressure grow inside your brain\nWhere every nerve is on fire\nYou start to wonder if you're going insane\nIt's not a fate you desired\n\nTime is running down\n\nMoments of reason that we hope to find\nAre we a thought somewhere in god's mind\nA work of art that he has never signed\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Can you see the future\nThough it's well disguised\nIs the end so certain\nThat you've closed your eyes\n\nDark as the dark can be\nBeckons eternity\nExits exist in life\nAs they do on this night\n\nNow's not the time to sleep\nThere are still nights to keep\nChances are there to take\nNow it is time to\n\n...\n\n", 
        "On the sea\nThey heard the voices sing\nThrough the storm\nThe island's closing in\nThey'd heard tales\nOf lives lost at sea\nDeserted beach just beyond their reach\nYou're approaching the island of the\n\nSirens\nSirens\nHungry for man tonight\nSirens\n...\n\n",
