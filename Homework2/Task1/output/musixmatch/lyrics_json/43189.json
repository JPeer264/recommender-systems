        "Girl, what's come between you and me?\nLook right through me\nI won't let it go\nI can't help this feeling anymore\nI will go anywhere\nMaybe you'll see\n\nWe are\nWe are the shaken (Shaken)\nWe are the monsters (Monsters)\nUnderneath your bed\nYeah\nBelieve what you read\nWe are\nWe are mistaken (Staken)\nWe are the voices (Voices)\nInside your head\nYeah\nBelieve what you see\n\nIt came as no surprise\nYou bring me back to life\nBelieve me\n\"You bleed for me, I'll bleed for you\"\nI caught you walking through walls\n...\n\n", 
        "What would you say if I asked you not to go?\nTo forget everyone, forget everything, and start over with me?\nWould you take my hand and never let me go?\nPromise me, you'll never let me go.\n\nAnd now the stars aren't out tonight,\nBut neither are we to look up at them.\nWhy does hello feel like goodbye?\nThese memories can't replace,\nThese wishes I wished and dreams I chased.\nTake this broken heart and make it right.\n\nI feel like I lost everything when you're gone.\nLeft remembering what it's like\nTo have you here with me.\nI thought you should know,\nYou're not making this easy.\n...\n\n", 
        "What makes us burn every bridge we cross?\nOr walk aimlessly into oncoming traffic?\nThird times a charm, but would we even get that far?\n...\n\n", 
        "The hand of my clock strikes two\nIn times when I got the best of you\nWe made promises we couldn't keep\nAnd every night we couldn't sleep.\nI didn't know why, but didn't ask questions\nbecause it was the first time in my life, yeah the first time in my life\nWhere I, did something right.\n\nI set myself up for the greatest fall of all time\nI set myself up for the greatest fall of all time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The sky looks like patchwork\nStitched just enough so the sky won't fall on top of us\nIts alright\nThe city was covered in gold\nAnd made out of dreams\nEverything we wanted was within our reach tonight\nAnd we stood\nTip-toed, Eyes-glued at the scene and the realization that\n\nEverything was so clear, And plain to see\nThis is where I belong, You can't take me\n...\n\n", 
        "A pictures worth a thousand words\nBut not worth the words I need to hear\nI miss you so much that it hurts\nAnd tonight, I wish you were here with me\nSo I could make you see\nThe stars, they lay across the sky so perfectly\nAnd they remind me of\nAll the times, when we used to sit underneath them, those summer nights\nAnd fall in love\n\n...\n\n", 
        "These words, fall from your mouth, and stab me in the back\nIt should have never come to this\nIt's too late, for your apologies\nThey can't bring back all that you've taken from me\nStripped of my pride, and left for dead\n\n...\n\n"
