        "Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,\nI wonder why he's not with me tonight.\nIf the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.\nI'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.\n\nAnd it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,\nToo late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.\nYou won't get more than you're living for,\nAnd it's too late to cry tonight.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door.\nThere'll be a better world waitin' if I do.\n'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before,\nThe only time I let my heart turn to you.\n\nNow, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.\nI'll take my heart, and head right for the door.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(John Pennell)\n\nIf I give my heart to you tonight\nWill you still be by my side?\nOr will you be gone with the morning sun\nLike a restless bird in flight?\n\nTake me in your arms\nLet the love you seek\nWash away your sorrow,\n...\n\n", 
        "In your eyes, I see gentle rain\nSpringtime comes, in love again\nputs me back on my feet again\nand in your eyes, i feel no pain\n\nand in my mind, I saw love walk past\na lovers dream within my grasp\nI never knew I could fall so fast\n...\n\n", 
        "When I step on board that big jet plane\nI'll be leaving our love behind\nI hope its wings will carry me somewhere\nI can mend this heart of mine\n\nCHORUS\nSo don't follow me, don't follow me\nI'm bound to a place I can't recall\n...\n\n", 
        "(John Pennell)\n\nI've lived a life full of sorrow\nWith nowhere to run or to hide\nHappiness you'll see is borrowed\nAll I want is you by my side.\n\nGentle river take me away\n...\n\n", 
        "(John Pennell)\n\nThere's a chill on this evening nights right for greaving\nDarkness surrounds him as he wanders alone\nHe walked past the dim lights the pathways and street lights\nThey remind him of nights long ago.\n\nWhen his love was strong\nAnd his muscles hard\nHis whiskey throat\nWas barley marred.\n\nSeeking the misfortune in the lies that he told\nThen a broken heart bought him to his knees\nIn the hour of his greatest need\n...\n\n",

        "No matter what I say or do,\nI just can't seem to get inside your heart\nWhat have I done wrong?\nLately you're so far away,\nYou just don't seem to hold me like you used to\nSomething's going on\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain\nSomeone to ease my pain when I feel blue\nIf I lost you to another, think I'd drown out here for sure\nWon't you stay with me and be my only cure?\n\nDark skies may cloud my day\n...\n\n", 
        "Walking out on me must be the way you show me how it feels to be her\nI realize the fault is mine, I'm getting everything that I deserve\n\nIt's over and older the tears seem much colder\nSunshiney days seem to be so blue\n...\n\n", 
        "Endless highway, as far as I can see\nThe road'll take me back to him tonight\nIt's been so long since I've seen him smile\nI'll be counting all the miles 'til I get home\n\nHow many hours 'til I hold him?\nHow many days before we hit the road again?\n...\n\n", 
        "(Nelson Mandrell)\n\nOh, it seems the sun will never shine\nThe skies are so gray\nAnd the heart you left broken is lonely\nThe winter wind blows through the trees\nAnd with the song I sing\nI long for the days you loved me only.\n\nSorrow lingers\nShadows only fill the empty room\nNights of lonely cries unheard\n...\n\n", 
        "(Nelson Mandrell)\n\nThe nights are so lonely and the days pass me by\nTrue love has faded, left me behind\nSo we'll just move along and stop wasting time\nIt's over all over now.\n\nIt's over, end of the line\n...\n\n", 
        "You may walk away in anger\nWear your heart upon your sleeve\nYou make act like it don't matter\nKeep me laughing while you leave\nBut burning bridges won't get me back\nIf you change your mind some day\nWhy can't we turn this scene around\nBefore you walk away?\n\nWill you be leaving, leaving me today?\nLike the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand\n...\n\n", 
        "Steel rails chasin' sunshine round the bend\nWinding through trees like a ribbon in the wind\nI don't mind not knowing what lies down the track\n'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back.\n\nIt's not the first time I found myself alone at dawn\nIf I really had you once then I'd have you when I'm gone\nWhistle blowing blowin' lonesome in my mind\nCalling me along that never endin' metal line.\n...\n\n", 
        "It's like I always figured\nYou'd be gone from me so soon\nA heartache would be the outcome\nAnd I'd be singing this lonely tune\n\nYour friends all tell me your happy now\nAnd how good she's treating you\nIt looks to be the perfect love\n...\n\n", 
        "(John Pennell)\n\nJust give me one good reason to stay tonight\nMust be something you could say to me\nTo keep me warm on this cold dark night\nCan you bring out the best in me.\n\nThat old moon in shining brightly\nUp above the midnight plains\nI only want your love to guide me back through the night\n...\n\n"
