        "The moon was all aglow\nAnd heaven was in your eyes\nThe night that you told me\nThose little white lies\n\nThe stars all seemed to know\nThat you didn't mean all those sighs\nThe night that you told me\nThose little white lies\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It seems we stood and talked like this before\nWe looked at each other in the same way then\nBut I can't remember where or when The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore\n...\n\n", 
        "It's very clear\nOur love is here to stay\nNot for a year\nBut ever and a day\n\nThe radio, and the telephone\nAnd the movies that we know\nMay just be passing fancies\nAnd in time may go\n...\n\n", 
        "How much do I love you?\nI'll tell you no lie\nHow deep is the ocean?\nHow high is the sky?\n\nHow many times a day do I think of you?\nHow many roses are sprinkled with dew?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Each time i look at you is like the first time\neach time you're near me the thrill is new\nand there is nothing that i wouldn't do for\nthe rare delight of the sight of you for\nThe more i see you, the more i want you\n...\n\n", 
        "You'll never know just how much I miss you\nYou'll never know just how much I care\nAnd if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you\nYou ought to know, for haven't I told you so\nA million or more times?\n\nYou went away and my heart went with you\n...\n\n", 
        "The very thought of you and I forget to do\nThe little ordinary things that everyone ought to do\nI'm living in a kind of daydream\nI'm happy as a king\nAnd foolish though it may seem\nTo me that's everything\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you,\nCome rain or come shine.\nHigh as a mountain and deep as a river,\nCome rain or come shine.\n\nI guess when you met me\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\nI'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string\nI'd say that I had Spring fever\nBut I know it isn't Spring\n\nI am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented\nLike a nightingale without a song to sing\nOh, why should I have Spring fever\nWhen it isn't even Spring?\n...\n\n", 
        "We have nothing to remember so far, so far,\nSo far, we haven't walked by night and shared the light of the star\nSo far, your heart has never fluttered so near, so near\nThat my own heart alone could hear it!\n...\n\n", 
        "You stepped out of a dream\nYou are too wonderful to be what you seem!\nCould there be eyes like yours,\nCould there be lips like yours\nCould there be smiles like yours,\nHonest and truly?\nYou stepped out of a cloud\nI want to take you away, away from the crowd\n...\n\n", 
        "I took one look at you\nThat's all I meant to do\nAnd then my heart stood still\n\nMy feet could step and walk\nMy lips could move and talk\nAnd yet my heart stood still\n\nThough not a single word was spoken\nI could tell you knew\n...\n\n", 
        "Stars in the sky were dancing\nOne night perfect for romancing, The night a sinner kissed an angel, He wanted thrills, she wanted love, Oh but his sighs were tender\nAs he begged her to surrender, The night a sinner kissed an angel, And she believed that it was love.\n...\n\n", 
        "Heaven\nI'm in heaven\nAnd my heart beats\nSo that I can hardly speak\nAnd I seem to find\nThe happiness I seek\nWhen we're out together\nDancing cheek to cheek\n\nHeaven\nI'm in heaven\nAnd the cares\nThat hung around me\nThrough the week\nSeem to vanish\nLike a gamblers\nLucky streak\nWhen we're out together\nDancing cheek to cheek\n\nOh\nI love to climb a mountain\n...\n\n", 
        "A very precious love\nIs what you are to me\nA stairway to a star\nA night in Shangri-La\nOf ecstasy\n\nLanterns of gold\nLanterns of blue\nTwinkle in the shadows\nWhile I dance with you\n...\n\n", 
        "Each time i look at you is like the first time\neach time you're near me the thrill is new\nand there is nothing that i wouldn't do for\nthe rare delight of the sight of you for\nThe more i see you, the more i want you\n...\n\n", 
        "I WISH I KNEW\nDick Haymes\n\nI wish I knew someone like you could love me\n...\n\n"
