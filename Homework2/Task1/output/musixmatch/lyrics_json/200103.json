        "Open up to the night\nOur bed is underneath the heavy moon\nCast a doubt like a shadow walking\nThrough the corners of the room\n\nI always thought I'd have a full tank to go\n(But not tonight, you're running low)\nI always thought I'd find my own way\nWhat's going on in your head now\nMaybe something I said,\nI know that you've been living in the past\nWhat's going on in your head now\nMaybe something I said now\n\nIt's driving me crazy\nYou can try to lie\nBut you're not gonna, not gonna deny\nNo you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "She was raised a protestant\nI was raised by wolves\nBoth of us saw dignity in vain\nStretching out in paradise\nIt wasn't in the cards\nSee, neither of us were ready for the rain\n\nGuess I was caught off-guard\nWhen I heard the news last week\nRan into a friend of mine\nWith the word on the street\n\nThat the life that you cose to lead\nHad the desired effect\nThat you hit the ground running\nThe day that you left\nThat you played for every side\nThat you'd gone for every kill\nBut I don't believe it\nAnd I never will\nI never will\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "On the corner of main street\nJust tryin' to keep it in line\nYou say you wanna move on and\nYou say I'm falling behind\n\nCan you read my mind?\nCan you read my mind?\n\nI never really gave up on\nBreakin' out of this two-star town\nI got the green light\nI got a little fight\nI'm gonna turn this thing around\n\nCan you read my mind?\nCan you read my mind?\n\nThe good old days, the honest man;\nThe restless heart, the Promised Land\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "We took a walk that night but it wasn't the same\nWe had a fight on the promenade out in the rain\nShe said she loved me but she had somewhere to go\nShe couldn't scream while I held her close\nI swore I'd never let her go\n\nTell me what you wanna know\nOh come on, oh come on, oh come on\nThere ain't no motive for this crime\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
