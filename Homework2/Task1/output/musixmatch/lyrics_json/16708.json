        "I'll be cooking again, be good-looking again\nWith a mademoiselle on each arm\n\nWhen I'm human again, only human again\nPoised and polished and gleaming with charm\n\nI'll be courting again, chic and sporting again\nWhich should cause several husbands alarm\n\nI'll hop down off this shelf, and tout de suite be myself\nI can't wait to be human again\n\nWhen we're human again, only human again\nWhen we're knickknacks and whatnots no more\n\nWhen we're human again, good and human again\nOh, cherie, won't it all be top drawer?\n\nI'll wear lipstick and rouge, and I won't be so huge\nWhy, I'll easily fit through that door\n\nI'll exude savoir-faire; I'll wear gowns; I'll have hair\nIt's my prayer to be human again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I had a dream, a dream about you, baby.\nIt's gonna come true, baby.\nThey think that we're through, but baby,\n\nYou'll be swell! You'll be great!\nGonna have the whole world on the plate!\nStarting here, starting now,\nhoney, everything's coming up roses!\n\nClear the decks! Clear the tracks!\nYou've got nothing to do but relax.\n...\n\n", 
        "Light the candles,\nGet the ice out,\nRoll the rug up,\nIt's today.\nThough it may not be anyone's birthday,\nAnd though it's far from the first of the year,\nI know that this very minute has history in it, we're here!\nIt's a time for making merry,\nAnd so I'm for making hay.\nTune the grand up,\nDance your shoes off,\nStrike the band up,\nIt's today!\nAnd we're living\nIn the world game,\n...\n\n",
