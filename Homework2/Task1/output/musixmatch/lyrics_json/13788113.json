        "I'm lurking in your pocket\nBetter watch it, Rizzle Kicks, ha\n\nWhat, I'm last on the heaven list\n'Cause I couldn't give a Razz what angelic is\nEven my laughter is venomous\nDennis is not even half what this menace is\n\nWe don't choose to make trouble\nHolding up stores with Lucozade bottles\nI'm the one forcing you to break bad role\nLittle goodie two shoes glue plane models\n\nUm, an air of sophistication\nWhen I enter various situations\nYour best mate's gone downstairs\nWhile you're stuck there with his sister waiting\n\nI'm chilling in estates, sniffing at a rave\nSitting in a cave with a grin up on my face\nI ain't civil but I'm brave, never listening to faith\nQuick smile then a middle finger to your face\n\nStuck in your pocket, in your feathers while you sleep\nI am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
