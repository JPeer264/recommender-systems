        "When I was a little\nGirl I called for you\nCome & save me from this, wicked world I\u00b4m born into!\n\nLET\u00b4S PLAY A GAME, OF HIDE & SEEK!\nI WANT MY PRINCE TO RESCUE ME\nFROM THE EVIL LURKING AT MY DOOR\n\nMy destiny, my fantasy, I\u00b4m calling, I\u00b4m calling\nWas tempted by a mystery, I called to you, only for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Let his holy choir sing in sodomy, praise be!\nSurrender your body and your soul unto him, demoralize me!\n\nSo he crept into my room\nWhispered my name, took my innocence away\nI\u00b4m only five, a pervert's concubine.\n\nGod has a plan for us all.\n...\n\n", 
        "Did I want to live\nWithin the empty space\nMy sleep numbed my pain\n\nNow I'm awake\nMy sanity has gone\n\nLittle girl screams\nFor life's release\nDon't hold me back I want to fall\nLittle girl pleads\nFor life's disease\nTo mourn away my soul\n...\n\n", 
        "Glass eyes shall stare, when tempted by\nA smile for the unknown, headrush!\nLike the river wild\nI see in your eyes\nA reflection of\nSomething forbidden\nunleashed by a lie you inspired\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I shall scream in silence\nI'll cry but not shed a tear\nI shall speak with no sound\nI shall hurt with no pain\nYour heart's as black as the night\nOn my death bed I'll crawl\n...\n\n", 
        "You'll twist and turn your spite\nTill you drain the sane\nCover up your track's with lie's\nDeceit hide's a smile\n\nSo tired of this false pretence\nCan't even look me in the eye\nApproached by truth, you take offence\nPraise the hypocrite!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hate the reflection that I see\nWish I could claw... away... my skin\n\nDemons won't let me flee, my mind's tragedy\nDon't label me, not a minority\nSociety created me\n\nFirst cut's the neatest, I didn't feel a thing\nDon't show me your pity\nSecond cut's the deepest, a release from within\nDon't try to analyse me\n...\n\n",

        "Each morning I prayed\nMy mirror displayed, my disgrace\nFrom the anger, bruised upon my face\n\nDragged through the halls\nYour cycle re-born\nLost your grip on life\n\nHell hath no fury like a woman scorned\nRe-live your nightmares through us\n...\n\n",
