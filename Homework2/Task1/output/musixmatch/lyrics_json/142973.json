        "With that innocent smile, you said trust me\nTogether we'll go far, you just trust me\nMaking promises in vain, that's easy for you\nYou gather all the pain, that's all you can do\n\nAll on my own, I was blind to see\nYou hypnotized me, I was lost\nNow I've awakened\nThe stone was just sand, now I'm a man\n\nHey, I'll say what I wanna say\nHey, I'll be what I wanna be\nLike a lion in a cage, inside I feel the rage\nHey, I'll say what I wanna say, can't stop me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
