        "Oh, every night I? m dreaming of you\nWe? re weaving through a crowded room\nI ask you to be is my best friend too\nAnd then I lose your heart\n\nOn a steamer with a small-city band\nI'll chase you through the room again\nYou're gone before that next dance ends\nI don? t know what it means\n...\n\n", 
        "Come with me and you'll never be the same.\nCome with me to the place I'm thinking of (across the bridge that keeps you form your love).\nCome with me but you must come alone (across the bridge that keeps you from your home)\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, I'm trying hard to pass the time\nBut I just got more time to kill\nYou know the flaming heart can't get his fill\nBut the flaming heart will try and try as he will\n\nAnd the flaming eyes I had are gone\nThey went out with the thrill\nYou know the flaming heart can't get his fill\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, where you goin?\nFor the two hundred and fiftieth time\n(Well, I? m waiting for a sign)\nWell, it looks just like another line\n\nAnd I? m walking backwards\nTo the place where I come from\nOh, but that ain? t enough, no, you want me to run\n\nUsed to feel like California\nWith baby eyes so blue\nNow I feel like Carolina\nI split myself in two\n...\n\n", 
        "Wise won't be wise anymore\nAnd might won't be might anymore\nAnd I am waiting for the day when I will finally know surrender\nAnd the weak will not be weak anymore\n\nLost won't be lost anymore\nHard won't be hard anymore\n...\n\n", 
        "Let's dance\nPut on your red shoes and dance the blues\nLet's dance\nTo the song they're playin' on the radio\n\nLet's sway\nWhile color lights up your face\nLet's sway\nSway through the crowd to an empty space\n\nIf you say run, I'll run with you\nIf you say hide, we'll hide\nBecause my love for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh a playful little kitten met a playful little bird,\nand then off with it's head, off with it's head, oh my!\n\nAnd a breeze met a blossom in a winter embrace\nand then off with it's head, off with it's head, oh my!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My heart is always on the line\nI've traveled all kinds of places\nThe song is always the same\nGot lonesome fuel for fire\n\nGot 45s to play at night\nGot books to spend with every weekend\nThe story's always the same\nGot lonesome fuel for fire\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, I went to the doctor\nI said doctor, please\nWhat do you do when your true love leaves?\nHe said the hardest thing in the world to do\nIs to find somebody believes in you\n\nMake a sad, make a sad, make a sad, sad song\nMake a sad, make a sad, make a sad, sad song\n\nAnd so I went to the whip\u2013poor\u2013will\nI said whip\u2013poor\u2013will, please\n...\n\n", 
        "I was washing antique cars\nWorking part-time for my dad after school\nWhen I got the go-ahead\nTo pick a car and spin around the neighborhood\n\nIt was a baby blue fifty-two Roadstar\nIt was a beautiful car\n\n...\n\n", 
        "From Springfield, Mass to Concord Town\nI saw those lights go down\nIn a gorge in Kansas\nI met my Jesus\nHe laid me down and he said\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Cough, cough\nAnd hacking in the hallway\nAnd he don't even cover his mouth\n\nHack, Hack\nAnd hacking in the morning\nThe elevator echoe his disease\n\nI think he knows I can hear him night and day\nI think he knows I can not live this way, oh\nI think he knows that I ain't sleeping\nI ain't sleeping\nI ain't...\n...\n\n", 
        "When I forget how to cry\nI see you out alone at night\nMy heart explodes in light, in sky\nAnd I want to close my eyes\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't need no sweets to make me happy\nI'm not like them babe, I won't be fooled by nothing.\nWhistle me out and I'll roll over\nHey, look me over!\n\nMy part-time job, it ain't exactly thrilling\n...\n\n", 
        "And what makes me happy\nAnd who makes me high\nSure won't be around on that night\n\nAnd who may be lazy\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, lightning may strike your poor heart tonight\nBut it won't happen twice, my friend\nAnd all the love you deserve is coming on stormy winds\n\nAnd I was jealous and cruel to a young girl I knew\nBut it wont happen twice, my friend\nOh, if I get the chance I'll be braver like holy wine\n\nAnd disaster has riddled my body with holes\nBut it won't happen twice, my friend\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, redemption is a pure signal\nIt's high in the pines like a bald eagle\nBut I've only seen it once or twice\nHe wanted me to follow but I fell down\n...\n\n"
