        "I got no money in my hand or my coat or my pocket\nWon't get to space 'cause I haven't got a rocket\nBut I have air in my lungs, eyes in my sockets\nAnd a heart that beats like a tap that leaks\nIn the night when you haven't got a plumber who can stop it\nJack in a box without a key to lock it\nWell this boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it\n'Cause the sea doesn't know my name\nYeah the boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it\n'Cause the sea doesn't know my name\nWell if you can't get what you love\nYou learn to love the things you've got\n\nIf you can't be what you want\nYou learn to be the things you're not\nIf you can't get what you need\nYou learn to need the things that stop you dreaming\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",

        "Tobacco stains our yellow teeth\nAnd all our fingers and underneath\nOur finger nails are glass bone sheets\nAs we try desperately to sleep\nHearts are saddened, eyes are tired\nAnd all this Red Bull keeps us wired\nIt gives us wings, it gives us rings\nAround our eyes\nWe put three sugars in our tea\nSit to watch day time TV\nAnd laugh at moms who don't know\nWho the father is\nAnd all our girlfriends are long gone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",
