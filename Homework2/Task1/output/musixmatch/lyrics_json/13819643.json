        "My rhymes so unspeakable\nMy dreams so unreachable\nGive it a purpose, cause life itself isn't meaningful\nNow that's the truth, I'm speaking for the youth\nThat's aiming for the top but falling from the roof\nHere we, here we go again, with my paper and my pen\nSummer 2012 its the year of the end, or is it?\nExquisite lyrics, you hear it or do you fear it\nJammin' in my car, smelling like teen spirit\nI see a star falling form the sky, should I catch it\nI wanna die in my car, should I wreck it\n\nThis drug makes you hooked once, should I test it\nYes no maybe so, now its time for me to grow\nOutside of my flow, Do I ever get to know\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "When we met you said you felt again\nYou told me we could never just be friends\n\nWhen we met you said you felt again\nYou told me we could never just be friends\n\nBut I didn't need you back then\nAnd now I'm begging you to stay\nBecause I don't know how to breathe without you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
