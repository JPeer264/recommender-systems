        "The Lord is my shepherd\nI shall not want\nHe makes me to lie down\nin green pastures\nHe leadeth me beside the still waters\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd\nI shall not want\nHe makes me to lie down\n...\n\n", 
        "The ash grove how graceful, how plainly 'tis speaking\nThe wind through it playing has language for me.\nWhenever the light through its branches is breaking,\nA host of kind faces is gazing at me.\nThe friends from my childhood again are before me\nEach step brings a memory as freely I roam.\nWith soft whispers laden the leaves rustle o'er me\nThe ash grove, the ash grove alone is my home.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I vow to thee my country, all earthly things above,\nEntire and whole and perfect, the service of my love.\nThe love that asks no question, the love that stands the test,\nThat lays upon the altar the dearest and the best.\nThe love that never falters, the love that pays the price,\n...\n\n", 
        "Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation\nDarkness stirs and wakes imagination\nSilently the senses abandon their defenses\nHelpless to resist the notes I write\nFor I composed the music of the night\n\nSlowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor\nGrasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender\nHearing is believing, music is deceiving\nHard as lightning, soft as candle light\nDare you trust the music of the night\n\nClose your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth\nAnd the truth isn't what you want to see\nIn the dark it is easy to pretend\nThat the truth is what it ought to be\n...\n\n", 
        "Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,\nThat saved a wretch like me.\nI once was lost but now am found,\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\nT'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.\nAnd Grace, my fears relieved.\nHow precious did that Grace appear\nThe hour I first believed.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When you walk through a storm\nHold your head up high\nAnd don't be afraid of the dark\n\nAt the end of the storm\nIs the golden sky\n...\n\n", 
        "Sous le d\u00f4me \u00e9pais, o\u00f9 le blanc jasmin\n\u00c0 la rose s\u2019assemble\nSur la rive en fleurs, riant au matin\nViens, descendons ensemble.\n\n(Under the thick dome, where the white jasmine\nWith the rose gathers,\nTo the flowered river bank, with morning laughter,\nCome, let us go down together.)\n\nDoucement glissons de son flot charmant\nSuivons le courant fuyant\nDans l\u2019onde fr\u00e9missante\nD\u2019une main nonchalante\nViens, gagnons le bord,\nO\u00f9 la source dort\nEt l\u2019oiseau, l\u2019oiseau chante.\n\n(Gently let us slip from the pleasant rising flow,\nLet us follow the fleeting current\nIn the shimmering stream,\nWithout any care,\nCome, let us reach the bank,\nWhere the spring waters slumber\nAnd the bird, the bird, she sings.)\n\nSous le d\u00f4me \u00e9pais\nO\u00f9 le blanc jasmin,\nAh! descendons\nEnsemble!\n\n(Under the thick dome where the white jasmine\n...\n\n", 
        "The house where I was born\nStill stands\nFor who I am\nEvery stone laid\nIs a bridge made to my past\n\nThe house where I grew tall\nTowers\nOver me\nShadows bring everything back in soft light\n...\n\n", 
        "The house where I was born\nStill stands\nFor who I am\nEvery stone laid\nIs a bridge made to my past\n\nThe house where I grew tall\nTowers\nOver me\nShadows bring everything back in soft light\n...\n\n", 
        "Your light shines far in the heavens\nOver the world, wandering\nGazing in human dwellings\nOver the world, wandering\nGazing in human dwellings\nSilvery moon in the velvet sky\nOh, once in awhile, stay with me\nTell me where is my love?\nOh, once in awhile, stay with me\nTell me where is my love... where?\n...\n\n", 
        "The old home town looks the same\nAs I step down from the train\nAnd there to meet me is my mama and papa\nDown the road I look and there comes Mary\nHair of gold and lips like cherries\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\nYes, they'll all be there to meet me\nArms reaching smiling sweetly\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\n...\n\n"
