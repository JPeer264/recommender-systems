That's what's up. And they can laugh it up.\nAnd they don't pass the buck.\nNothing for certain we all have to trust someone,\nI used to want to find the love of my life,\nnow i'm trying to live a life of love, it's not just a husband and wife thing\nsomething that christ bring's some comfort at night\ntrue beauty doesn't run from the light.\nKeep Shining.\n\nKeep Shining\n...\n\n", 
        "[Verse 1: Shad]\nI can't derail I train hard then relax on tracks\nKeep the brain sharp hitting like an axe on wax\nAxe never touch trees meaning I don't puff weed\nBut I hope to plant my seeds before I must leave\nBelieving that hope grows even in the stone cold\nBitter and bleak old souls sold like its antique\nRoad show except for so damn cheap\nThey preach the new science hone the program sheep\nBut they won't find us, it's hide and go seek\nTo control minds like gold mines in Mozambique\nWhere the folks can't eat so I stroll to slow jam beat\nSlow dancing life's no grand prix\nNo race no pace car and there is no shortcuts\nAnd no ones that special and there ain't no short bus\nThe core of us are simple, but dignified\nWe don't simply live to die\nLook through the inner eye in the sky\n...\n\n",
