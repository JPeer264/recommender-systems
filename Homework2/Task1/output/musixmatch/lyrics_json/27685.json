        "There was an awful lot of rocking going on that night,\nCruising time for the young bright lights,\nJust down past the gasworks, by the meat factory door,\nThe five lamp boyswere coming on strong.\nThe Saturday night city beat had already started\nThe pulse of the corner boys sprang into action\nAnd young Billy watched it all under the yellow street light\nAnd said \"tonight of all nights there's gonna be a fight\"\n\nHe doesn't like it living here in this town\nHe says the traps have been sprung long before he was born\nHe says \"hope bites the dust behind all the closed doors\nAnd pus and grime ooze from its scab crusted sores.\nThere's screaming and crying in the high rise blocks\"\nIt's a rat trap Billy and you're already caught\nBut you can make it if you want to or you need it bad enough\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "On a night like this I deserve to get kissed at least once or twice\nYou come over to my place screaming blue murder, needing someplace to hide.\nWell, I wish you'd keep quiet,\nImaginations run riot,\nIn these paper-thin walls.\nAnd when the place comes ablaze with a thousand dropped names\nI don't know who to call.\nBut I got a friend over there in the government block\nAnd he knows the situation and he's taking stock,\nI think I'll call him up now\nPut him on the spot, tonight.\n\nThey saw me there in the square when I was shooting my mouth off\nAbout saving some fish.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
