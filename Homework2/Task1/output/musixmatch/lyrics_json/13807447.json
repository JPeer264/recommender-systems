        "Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back,\nand let the sun light in my lap.\nI sang a hymn to bring me peace,\nand then it came, a melody\n\nIt felt so sweet, it felt so strong,\nIt made me feel like I belonged,\nand all the sadness inside me melted away like I was free\n\nI've found what I've been looking for in myself,\nFound a life worth living for someone else,\nNever thought that I could be, I could be happy, happy.\n\n...\n\n"
