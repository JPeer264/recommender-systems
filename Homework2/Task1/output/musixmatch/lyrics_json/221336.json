        "Walk down to the caf\nLook round\nDo your maths\nThere's a time for everyone\nBut time is creeping fast\nNow let me introduce someone you once knew\nWalk backwards, walk\nTell me when you reach home\nYou said you were autistic\nBut you really had a cold\n...\n\n", 
        "Trust me on this one\nTuesday's when we will come\nWith our guns, with our knives\nYou swallow all that we put on your plate\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me see your body, double tommy homi\nI'ma do it two times before I leave ma\u00f1ana\nGirl recently called me, crying say she love me\nAll up in my business but don't ever keep me company\nIt's all my fault, I'm sorry, know I text back hardly\nSay I'll try my hardest but I'm working even harder\nThe way I kept it up you could've swore I was the target\nBut instead I am the bullet, let's just see how far I get\nTryna get this money, baby let's just see what car I get\n...\n\n", 
        "In the trunk of your car,\nYou don't have to know I think...\nYou don't have to know I think...\nYou don't have to know who you are,\nOr where you're going.\nJust buckle up for the ride.\n\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You can\u2019t trust that sand\nYou\u2019re sleeping in all the time\nYou\u2019ll see me on the screen\nThrough all the other souls that I\u2019ve bought with this oil\nMexico says: good night!\n\nThe tape machine is bust\nFrom all that spinning round and round\nI\u2019ve scratched all my reels\nAnd bitten all my nails to the bone\nLike a stone, you\u2019ll come back when thrown up\nAway from the tar\nAnd away from the drills\nBut kid I\u2019m a pilot\n...\n\n", 
        "They stayed put in their houses\nOr moved to higher grounds\nThere are ghosts by the reservoir\nBut no one wants them round no more\nThere\u2019s a spell\nFor the dam to break\nThey\u2019ll tell you all about the time when it came\nWhat they took away\nIn 1922\n\nIt caused a drought\nIt caused a flood\nIt came to change us all for good\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh they hide it in their beds, they grow it in their sheds\nThey serve it up in cups from overseas\nIn the gardens in the trees\n\nAnd if we\u2019re kicking up a fuss, it\u2019s only cause we must\nLet the world begin to understand\nBegin to understand\n...\n\n", 
        "Look up, open the clouds\nHere comes the bombshell\nOn the way home\u2026\n\nAnd now we want the coal?\nConfusing times\n\nCry murder, cry what you like\nJust let the comets lead the way\n\nWe\u2019ll tear it down\nWe\u2019ll hold the truth by the neck\nKick in the doors and burn the books\nTry to forget\n...\n\n", 
        "On the fire escape\nWe stopped and we looked down\nThrough the broken glass, \non the sirens on the spies\nWhen you\u2019re still midway\nIt\u2019s not too late to just turn back\n\nThe winter is cruel round here\n...\n\n", 
        "They swallowed it whole, they went for the gold for the gold\nWe fall for the same lies, we all have the same shoes to fill\n\nThe preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone\nSome day they will be forgotten and die one by one\n\nThe walls, the walls are coming down, \nthe here and now is coming round\nIt will some day let you down\nThe ships, the ships are coming in, \n...\n\n", 
        "Even though the lights have changed I\u2019m caught up in an endless loop\nDriving for ten hours and then ending up in the same place!\nCan you hear a rumble under ground? can you hear the beat?\nSomeone pacing round and round in circles on the floor above\n\nBut we can still afford to not make sense at all\nWe can still afford to not make sense at all\n\nI see you wearing surgery rubber gloves, standing in the street\nEarly in the morning, still awake but barely on your feet\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If it is growing\nIf it is clawing\nAnd wants to get out\nThen let it come out\n\nYour memory\u2019s failing\nYour eyes are like rocks\nAnd I can see you on the floor of your box\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You\u2019ve been packing your bags for the tenth time\nYou\u2019ve been up on the roof again\nSo you\u2019re biding your time but it\u2019s all right they\u2019re coming any week now\nLeft behind by the mothership, they\u2019re our only real friends\nBut inside, inside, you\u2019ll always feel the same, even when you wake up\nEven if you wake up\n\nIn a town where everyone will kick and scream\nAnd come to the same conclusion every time\nTime to realize you were never on the team\nThere was always a question hanging over you\nIn a hot air balloon with a rusty nail\nLooking over your shoulder and setting sail\n\nYour dreams will become part of the future and coincide with the past\nYou spend all your time by the radio waiting for the signal\nBut inside, inside, you\u2019ll always feel the same, even when you wake up\nEven if you wake up\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Wait here for the flag to fall\nAnd follow me to the edge of town\nYour family\u2019s seen you on your bike\nAll they say is it\u2019s such a waste of time\nStay clear of the runner up\nHe\u2019s got some tricks he\u2019s not afraid to try\n\nI stopped racing years ago\nI stopped listening \nI stopped speaking\n...\n\n"
