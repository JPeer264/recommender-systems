        "I never meant to get us in this deep\nI never meant for this to mean a thing\nOh, I wish you were the one\nWish you were the one that got away\n\nI got caught up by the chase\nAnd you got high on every little game\nI wish you were the one\nWish you were the one that got away\n\nOh, if I could go back in time\nWhen you only held me in my mind\nJust a longing gone without a trace\nOh, I wish I'd never ever seen your face\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
