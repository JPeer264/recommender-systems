        "I saw somebody die out upon the road today\nI felt lives dissolve on sidestreets as that head hit the highway\nI see first responders rush in as a white plume dissipates\nTrying to pull their will to power from the flames\n\nNow there's miles of angry motorists stretched as far as eyes can see\nThere are a billion breathing beings each with schedules to keep\nThey get a long look at the tow truck as they sit and grit their teeth\nHating that which comes between them and their coffee\n\n...\n\n", 
        "A band trip dance\nWhat could be the harm\nBut a six week vacation from the use of my right arm?\nIt was just the two hits\nAnd I remember nothing more\nOnly Alex hitting the switch\nand me hitting the floor\nWe're taking this lying down\nThe one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground\nMr. McDermott, won't you help me to my feet?\nBecause the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets\n\nThe long walk home\nAn hour and a half\nBut quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass\nBut by June 22nd\nI have done the math\n...\n\n", 
        "The first thing you see is the light\nThen, you focus on a man in a mask with a knife\nAs he cuts you away from everything you thought you knew about life\nNow you're in your mother's arms, wrinkled and wet\nYou'll spend the rest of your life trying to hard to forget\nThat you met the world naked and screaming\nAnd that's how you'll leave it\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My immortal soul is under attack!\n\nMy parents' sacred vows have all been taken back.\n\nCreated from a love that never happened\n\nIs the child who is born of original sin.\n\nCondemned by Christ, by Allah, abhorred,\n...\n\n", 
        "(Whispered) Are we ready to go?\n\n\"From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe and Asia could not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio River or set a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we will live forever, or die by suicide.\" (-Lincoln)\n\nThere'll be no more counting the cars on the garden state parkway\nNor waiting for the Fung Wah bus to carry me to who-knows-where\nAnd when I stand tonight, 'neath the lights of the Fenway\nWill I not yell like hell for the glory of the Newark Bears?\n\n'Cause where I'm going to now, no one can ever hurt me\nWhere the well of human hatred is shallow and dry\nNo, I never wanted to change the world, but I'm looking for a new New Jersey\n'Cause tramps like us, baby, we were born to die\n\nI'm doing 70 on 17, I'm doing 80 over 84\nAnd I never let the Meritt Parkway magnetize me no more\n...\n\n", 
        "The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere\nThe enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere\nBut nobody seems to be worried or care\nThat the enemy is everywhere\n\nThe enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere\nThe enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to like walking with my eyes down\nI'd sleep all day and fret away the night hours\nBut then I saw the sun and felt its light's power\nAnd I found out the planet ain't no private house\nNow I turn a brave bully to a shy coward\nI make a loud lout silent as a quiet mouse\nThen I make them hand over the white cloud\nAnd then they're leaving me with a polite bow\nAnd I've got plans I haven't time to write down\nI'll incite a riot, fire flying all around\nWhen I'm crying out, I'm howling with the wild hounds\nDon't wanna buy an ounce\nFor me, the right amount is the entire pound\n\nI only like it when it's dimed out\nI only like it when it's dimed out\nI only like it when it's dimed out\nWhen it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out\n\n...\n\n"
