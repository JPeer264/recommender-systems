        "There is no one, nothin' to see\nThe night is useless and so are we\n'Cause everybody knows\nThe fabric of folly is fallin' apart at the seams\nAnd I've been lookin' for a good time\nBut the pleasures are seldom and few\nThere's no whiskey, there's no wine\nJust the concrete and a worried mind\n'Cause everybody knows death creeps in slow\n'Til you feel safe in his arms\n...\n\n"
