        "Walking slow down the freeway, Sarah says that it's not much further\nKiss the sunlight on her face, let's say goodbye to this old and broken\ntown\n\nWhere we fell in love\nDead end streets became a drug\nHeld our voices like a prison cell, but now we shout it from the rooftops\n\nOh, we are the kids that you never loved\nWe are the ones that will never grow up\nWe're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh\nWe are the voices you never heard\nWe are the fire you never let burn\nWe're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh\n\nSay goodbye to your old friends, kicking down all the rusty fences\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
