        "I wanna fall to pieces\n\nTake another piece of me\nTake it anyway you need it\nWhat you get or what you see\nThere really isn't any secret\nAnd with the hand as cold as ice\nOhh, there you go\n\nTake it all away\nWatching as you break\nAll I am is you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
