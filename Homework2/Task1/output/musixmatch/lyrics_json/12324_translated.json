        "My angel there she goes\nWhere she comes from\nNobody knows\nShe came walkin' quiet as a bird, walkin' softly\nWith a good word\n\nAnd who was I talkin' to\nSoon I must see for myself\nNew love don't run away\nI don't think you understand\nHow deeply you touch me\n...\n\n", 
        "First things first\nWhen you can quit livin' in the past\nWhen you stop worryin' 'bout tomorrow\nThen I think you just might last\n\nAnd I know the price of freedom\nGettin' more than a little high\n...\n\n", 
        "New mama's got a son\nIn her eyes\nNo clouds are in my changing skies\nEach morning when I\nGet up to rise\nI'm livin' in a dreamland\n\n...\n\n"
