        "Big world\nPlease do not swallow us up\nPlease do not blind our eyes\nWith ocean blue\n\nYoung girl\nShe's got time left to grow up\nSee the light of hope in her eyes\nShe gives to you\n\nAnd now I know\nJust what we're fighting for\nHow long to go\nUntil we ask for more\n\nAnd we all might find ourselves\nLiving below the line\nStill living below\nThe line\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Wake up, wake up, the sun cannot wait for long\nReach out, reach out before it fades away\nYou will find the warmth when you surrender\nSmile into the fear and let it play\n\nYou wanna run away, run away\nand you say that it can't be so\nYou wanna look away, look away\nbut you stay cause' it's all so close\nWhen you stand up and hold out your hand\nIn the face of what I don't understand\nIt's my reason to be brave\n...\n\n", 
        "Plan entering rays of light now, I get up from, Nellombra narrowed eyes look at me, they speak. Say a thousand words of love with the look. And I promise you, My heart will love you forever, And I fall in love, ...", 
        "\nI don't know you\nBut I want you\nAll the more for that\nWords fall through me\nAnd always fool me\nAnd I can't react\nAnd games that never amount\nTo more than they're meant\nWill play themselves out\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Far across this weird horizon\nI am walking down the line\nI am picking up the pieces\nThat this storm has left behind\n\nAfter all the clouds are fallen\nI would preach the better ground\nTurn your darkness into light\nTurn your silence into sound\n\nBut I can't cage you in my arms\nWhen my heart is driving forward\nTo avoid your false alarms\nAnd you can't tell me not to stay\nWhen I opened up the window\n...\n\n", 
        "Coffee is on the table, and I\nJust can't seem to wake up this aching heart of mine\nOne more day without you and I'll be fine\nI know I'm good for waiting but waitings wasted time\n\nOh and I, I don't take it lightly,\nThe trouble that I've gone through, to get you to know who I am\nOh and I, I can't find a reason to be happy in this heartache,\n'Cause I should know better than that\nI'm better than that\n\n...\n\n", 
        "\nEcho star is a crossing you\nTrembling noises that come too soon\nSpatial movement which seems to you\nResonating your mass call few\n\nHollow talking and hollow girl\nVoicing up from the root of pain\nNever said it was good, never said it was me\nShadow rises and you are here\n\nAnd then you carve\n...\n\n", 
        "My own love said to me\nMy mother won't mind\nAnd my father won't smite you\nFor your lack of kind\n\nShe went away from me\nAnd this she did say\nIt will not be long\nTil our wedding day\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Just know that eye for an eye, what you see that what you sow you reap If I give I receive because love is an act of faith not deprive the world of love Without sun and rain grow flower The miracle is you do not let it die One more soul and finally marching armies of hope ...", 
        "there for me, every time i've been away\nwill you be there for me, thinking of me everyday\nare you my destiny, words i never dared to say\n\nwill you be there for me?\njust think of you and me, we could never tow the line\nit's such a mystery just to hear you say you're mine\nand while you're close to me, so close to me\n\njust hold me\nwhen you're feeling cold and all the city streets are grey\nwalking all alone and watching how the children play\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Do not look Do not try to explain I knew sooner or later ended That&#39;s just yesterday That you said &quot;I love you because&quot; I was only a state of agony There is nothing more illusory love Never believe that May happen to you To find yourself above a thread of hope ...", 
        "Don't give up\nIt's just the weight of the world\nWhen your heart's heavy\nI... I will lift it for you\n\nDon't give up\nBecause you want to be heard\nIf silence keeps you\nI... I will break it for you\n\nEverybody wants to be understood\nWell I can hear you\nEverybody wants to be loved\n...\n\n", 
        "Dried leaves fall and come April, will touch my soul. You will approach, you&#39;ll come for me. After so lonely, I&#39;ll feel. I find my peace in you. ...", 
        "Where has that old friend gone\nLost in a February song\nTell him it won't be long\nTil he opens his eyes, opens his eyes\nWhere is that simple day\nBefore colors broke into shades\nAnd how did I ever fade\nInto this life, into this life\n\nAnd I never want to let you down\nForgive me if I slip away\nWhen all that I've known is lost and found\n...\n\n", 
        "I wonder why are there so With those eyes on me You will see that then I will go is that I did not expect this madness pretend I&#39;ll get used to continue in silence without you Alone with just memories Tomorrow everything will end But now stay here Here with me because it will be. ..", 
        "A waltz when she walks in the room\nShe pulls back the hair from her face\nShe turns to the window to sway in the moonlight\nEven her shadow has grace\nA waltz for the girl out of reach\nShe lifts her hands up to the sky\nShe moves with the music\nThe song is her lover\nThe melody's making her cry\nSo she dances\nIn and out of the crowd like a glance\nThis romance is\nFrom afar calling me silently\n...\n\n", 
        "She stares through my shadow\nShe sees something more\nBelieves there's a light in me\nShe is sure\nAnd her truth makes me stronger\nDoes she realize\nI awake every morning\nWith her strength by my side\n\nI am not a hero\nI am not an angel\nI am just a man\nMan who's trying to love her\nUnlike any other\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell me what would make my day, who would dream if you are not. How could breathe the air, away from you. When not here. Only for you, I walk into infinity. You would face eternity. Only for you ... Tell me what you feel in your soul, tell me why lives in me. ...", 
        "I watch the morning dawn upon your skin\nA splinter in the light\nIt caught and frayed the very heart of us\nIt's been hiding there inside for all this time\nHow a sure thing winds up just like this\nClockwork silence only knows\n\nAnd it's no one's fault\nThere's no black and white\nOnly you and me\nOn this endless night\nAnd as the hours run away\nWith another life\nOh, darling can't you see\nIt's now or never\n...\n\n", 
        "One day, you know for us freedom will come to love here without limits and blossom dream denied to us will reveal the love hidden now ...", 
        "Here&#39;s the darkness out of me and a bit inside as well ... How absurd is this desert city without people! I can not even explain how, But this is my size, and my mind is never at peace, and increasingly elsewhere. Where are you? your voice? without you, without your help it will be me? Everything will look better ...", 
        "Through the darkness\nI can see your light\nAnd you will always shine\nAnd I can feel your heart in mine\nYour face I've memorized\nI idolize just you\n\nI look up to\nEverything you are\nIn my eyes you do no wrong\nI've loved you for so long\nAnd after all is said and done\n...\n\n", 
        "If you were in my eyes for a day, you would see the beauty full of joy I find in your eyes and nearo whether magic or loyalty If you were in my heart that one day you might have an idea ...", 
        "Who can say for certain\nMaybe you're still here\nI feel you all around me\nYour memories so clear\nDeep in the stillness\nI can hear you speak\nYou're still an inspiration\nCan it be\n\nThat you are my\nForever love\nAnd you are watching over me\nFrom up above.\n\nFly me up to where you are\nBeyond the distant star\nI wish upon tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "I never felt in my soul so much love And nobody but you, I love For you laughed and cried, also I RENACI What I say, to have you here I know that saying goodbye is best Suffering promissory my mistake Nothing will be the same, I have to accept And find the strength in me for this goodbye Stay away, I can not but no longer is no way back time Forget me And let me go alone with my solitude ...", 
        "Dedicated to those guilty or innocent lost in this sea has surrendered to the power those who have never been successful? For those who have always a hope in front of a pain in the cold of a room dedicated to those seeking his freedom sing to life to its beauty to his every wound every Carrezza, Carrezza I sing to life and to its tragic beauty To pain and to strife, but all that dances through me ...", 
        "Let me fall\nLet me climb\nThere's a moment when fear\nAnd dream must collide\n\nSomeone I am\nIs waiting for courage\nThe one I want\nThe one I will become\nWill catch me\n\nSo let me fall\nIf I must fall\nI won't heed your warnings\nI won't hear them\n...\n\n", 
        "V1\nStarry, starry night\nPaint your palette blue and gray.\nLook out on a summer's day\nWith eyes that know the darkness in my soul.\nShadows on the hills,\nSketch the trees and daffodils,\nCatch the breeze and the winter chill\nIn colors on the snowy linen land.\n\nChorus\nNow I understand what you tried to say to me\nAnd how you suffered for your sanity\nAnd how you tried to set them free.\nThey would not listen.\nThey did not know how.\nPerhaps they'll listen now.\n\nV2\n...\n\n", 
        "Now, ever, the dreaded moment for a long time, I know I already know what I will say to me, and the end of us. I know that with him you feel more free to be willing, to take count of more What a fool I&#39;m the one who gave you all of me Now that you&#39;re carrying my heart go with you. A love forever lasts only an instant are so many memories that vanish in you ..."
