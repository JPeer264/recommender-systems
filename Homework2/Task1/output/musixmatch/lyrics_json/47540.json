        "All my doubts will vanish this night\nWith the arrival of the master of the Darkness and the Light\nWith the mournful wolves howl beneath the shadowy walls\nOf the ancient citadel in time of the tolls\nAnd the wanderers ride to be blessed by His Might\nFrom the mouth of the Abyss where things have no names\nAnd all creatures 're created of Dark Blood and Flames\nWhere the Sky and the Ground are united in one\nAnd the Eternity once has begun\n\nWe are rising\nThe Darkest of Names\nEternal for those who's alive and forbidden for the Wretched Ones\n...\n\n", 
        "(the old one) The moan... Who has remembered?\nWho is still able to remember about how they did dream and yearn\nLaugh and dance and then about how they were dying\nTo flow towards the stellar worlds beyond the horizons of mind\nWhere all our laws are nothing at all\nMaybe to dwell forgotten maybe once to return...\n\n(the young one) Dark are thy eyes and dark are soul of thine\nWhat is it you know of them?\nReveal to me their stories...\n\n(the old one) As deep as never before I feel them call to me\nFrom the brightest blaze from place where all the paths come to the end\nMisunderstood ones wished a Strange\nWho've left this world when the world was changed\n...\n\n", 
        "Come and take me away Procession waits for ceremony\nWhite hearse among the trees And endless line of black hoods\nNothing will break the solemnity First Gates are closed\n...\n\n", 
        "Far away beyond the blackest ocean of blood on the boundless scope of lost\nmainland of\nNameless Horror under pale nebulas united in mysterious runes I've found the\nthing I've been\ninspired. Night wind is bringing mournful sounds of bell, I count the\nstrikes - three times in\nsix, someone's will thickens the mist for me to step the ground where all\nthe sacred burn. No\nbeast, no bird, no even shade appears to sign the flow of time fang-shaped\ntowers of\nhollow torment stand embraced by crimson flames. And I am coming into this\n...\n\n",

        "Stay...\nAs the Legend comes true...\nAmong the virgin snows we are Her silent envoys\nWe make you dream\nAbout what's happened\nLong ago\nSo long ago...\nI've seen you off by a vernal sunrise\nTo meet again in autumn dusk\nAnd overcome with sudden uneasiness\nA fine delight of my throbbing heart\nBe standing quiet, blessed with oblivion\nInhaling the freshness of your enchanting cold\nAnd feel this strange severe fondness\nYou grant me captured to behold\nThese calm and solemn snowfalls\n...\n\n", 
        "A pale cold haze by stealth conceals the path\nAs lurking shade transforms the day so fast\nRich colors fall against the bleak decay\nAm I the one to pass these waters longing\nFor their living prey?\nAll where I can turn my look is a reign of Mire\nI cry out but echoes die unborn\nThe dismal life of the Mighty Bogs\nShall go on undisturbed at all...\nPerceive the stuffiness, the swamp's breathing hard\nDigesting dreams of those who're now its part\n...\n\n", 
        "Master am I of the dark side you have never been even close to\nOblivion I give to the hordes, watching the sun\nBurning their eyes that can't see\nI know I am the one you hate and fear\nFear of my black heaven calls\nOne day to leave... to live\n\"Maybe it's just the way to be?\"\nHumility! How I scorn you worms!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Pain-disfigured burning face...\nLips seeking some moisture...\nMorbid delirium emitting distress\nLet this flooding despair caress me...\nWe've been chosen today\n(Following instincts)\nTo arise being haunted to death...\nCome closer as this mournful day falls\nBlinded by men, yet still able to hear\nThe laughter, which is fading towards\nThe secret domain of our souls\n...\n\n", 
        "Time! As a demon I rise, feeling the hunger\nI gather us for the final Sabbath at last on this night\nAnd I fly as the nightshade attacks the light\nAs it makes me the strings of thy wrath and all-conquering sin\nDown into the hunt! Till the darkness allows\nNone of their bastions will be safe on this hour\nBefore the daylight devours our flesh, I wonder,\nHow many will manage to flee?\nThis night is worth the whole life\nYet the prophecy says we all to be burnt in the pitiful dawn\nSo be it! This oath's yet to serve us:\nIn torments and deaths to unite!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I would love to get to know you more\nTo spend a lot of time with you\nMaybe travel around with you\nBecause you've got such a beautiful nature\nYou've got a beautiful nature\nYou've got a beautiful nature\nSinging this song to you\nI would love to hold you close\nMaybe rub your nose with my nose\nYou've got such a beautiful nature\nYou've got a beautiful nature\nYou've got a beautiful nature\nGo let it shine\n...\n\n"
