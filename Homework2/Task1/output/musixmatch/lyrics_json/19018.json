        "Oh, why does she sing her sad songs for me,\nI'm not the one\nTenderly bring her soft sympathy\nI've just begun\nTo see my way clear\nAnd it's plain,\nIf I stop I will fall\nI can lay down a tear for her pain\nJust a tear and that's all\n\nOh, what does she want me to do?\nShe says that she knows\nThat moments are rare\nI suppose that it's true\nThen on she goes\nTo say I don't care,\nAh, she knows\nThat I do\n\nMaybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song\nAnd who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Well, the name she gave was Caroline\nThe daughter of a miner\nAn' her ways were free, an' it seemed to me\nThat sunshine walked beside her\n\nShe comes from Spencer, across the hill\nShe said her pa had sent her\n'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow\nWould turn the skies to winter\n\nWell, she said, she'd come to look for work\nShe was not seekin' favors\nFor a dime a day and a place to stay\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Well it's many a fine lady that's walked along beside me\nWith their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rain\nWell some tried to hold me to hurt me to hide me\nAnd some turned away not to look back again\n\nOne stood among them I remember most clearly\nWell her sorrows were heavy and her laughter was slow\nWell I courted her gently and I loved her most dearly\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Well, a diamond fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria\nAll the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky\nThe brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall\nThat spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes\n\nWell, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine\nAll the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free\nWell, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Sometimes I dont know where\nThis dirty road is taking me\nSometimes I cant even see the reason why\nI guess I keep a-gamblin\nLots of booze and lots of ramblin\nIts easier than just waitin around to die\n\nOne time, friends, I had a ma\nI even had a pa\nHe beat her with a belt once cause she cried\nShe told him to take care of me\nHeaded down to tennessee\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",

        "When the bandits have stolen your jewelry and gone\nAnd your crippled young gypsy, he's grown tall and strong\nAnd your dead misconceptions have proven you wrong\nWell then, princess, where you plannin' to turn to?\n\nWhen your magazine memory has spun you around\nAnd you realize your lovers were just painted clowns\nAnd outside your window you start hearing sounds\nWhere they're building a cross for to burn you\n\nWhen all your bright scarlet turns slowly to blue\nWill you stop and decide that it's over?\n\nWhen your teardrops go sour and no longer fall\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "I'll play upon my violin\nUntil the mountains ring\nOf lonely laughter blindly thrown\nAcross an endless arc of strings\nAnd the skies are sad\nThey're dancin' to a silent symphony\nAnd the velvet voices all shall join\nThe singing\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Well, I ain't very big for twenty-one\nAnd it seems like I never could have any good clean fun\nCause every time I'd go outside some great big ol' bully'd come along\nHe'd hit me in the face and he'd knock me to the ground\nAnd he'd start kickin' me all around\nAnd that ain't exactly fair, friends, that's wrong.\n\nSo I got me a paper the other night\nAnd I crawled up on the sofa and I turned on the light\nAnd flipped through the pages till I found the classified ads.\nSaid, \"take karate from Lee Hung Chow;\nMan, make your first appointment now\nThis course is guaranteed to make you bad.\"\n\nWell, the next day I drove to the address\nAnd by the Japanese design I was really impressed\nIt looked like a regular house of the rising sun\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "You live on your hill so high and so lonely\nYou toss out your bread crumbs to those down below\nThey think you're a king, believe me it's only\nBecause they're too blinded to know\n\nYour castle is dingy and dirty and dismal\nYour carpets are faded, your walls are all grey\nThere's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal\nAnd all your young servants have drifted away\n\nWell, there once was a time when your money had meaning\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
