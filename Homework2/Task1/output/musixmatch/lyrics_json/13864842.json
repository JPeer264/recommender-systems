        "I am the chosen one\nThe one to ride in the golden sun\nThe only one\nWho never had a fairy growing up\nI was told to run\nUntil my journey is over and done\nSave her from his clutch\nI know that I can't till I'm old enough\nI am the chosen one\nto slay all the evil with no remorse\nA faster horse\nAnd kill all my foes with the master sword\nFind the triforce\nAnd keep it away from the man I swore\nTo kill\nI'm damn sure\nTo take back the land\nfrom\nGanondorf\nHere comes the storm\nHere comes the storm\nI am the chosen one\nTo get the medallions from the temples\nI know it's tough\nBut my stallion's very helpful\nI'm wiser now,\nAbout to bring you your repentance\nI find the clouds,\nand now you feel a rain of vengeance\nThe chosen one\nThe one who has been bestowed upon\nThe journey that I alone have begun\nAnd then I will find the stones you want\nI am the chosen one\nThe one to protect the sacred realm\nFor seven whole years, they waited still\nAnd now I am back with the Sages' help.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
