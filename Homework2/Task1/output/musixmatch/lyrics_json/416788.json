        "i was nervous in the morning, in a car, a backseat driver\nwith a handful of the chapters from the stories we were starting\nevery time you crossed the border where the water flows in cascades\n\nyou were coming with your sister from your mother's in the valley\nwhere the calls of rooks and ravens are the only thing you hear\nas you imagine yourself living with no phone or electricity\n\nwe were headed to the outpost where our friends had all assembled\nto receive us in our glory, where the trees cling for their safety\nfrom the edge of the world, and the birds revolved around us\nas the sea swallowed our vows\n\nand after we were married we went to our white stone cottage\nand you took your simple dress off, and your tears fell in my eyes\nas we were overcome with wonder at the love around us\n\nyou take me as i am and turn me into someone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "I caught the sun on my way home, my way home\nI caught the sun on my way home, my way home\nWhen I got lost in thinking\nI missed the train on my way home, my way home\nI missed the train on my way home, my way home\n'Cos I was still day dreaming\n\nOh and I need to know, are you the one? Are you the one?\n(Lucy could you really be the one that I've been wishing on?)\nYes I need to know\n(Lucy I can't stop myself from wondering)\nAre you the one I've been waiting for?\n\nI saw you blink and I missed your eyes, your blue eyes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Waiting for a train\nGoing nowhere in a nowhere station\nStaying up last night\nGoing nowhere with my trains of thought\nSleeping with your boy\nGoing nowhere in a long distance relation\nBlinded of your senses\nBy the fear of unrequited love\n\nOnce more I woke up in the moonlight\nOnce more our paths crossed through the night\nAnd a moment's hesitation\nYour silent invocation\nBut you shielded me from your glow\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "When you're tired and you're far from home\nWhen you're lost and you're on your own\nWhen the fog comes a-swirling, swirling round you\nMm, 'til you can't see the path before you\nYou should know of the strangest things\n\nYou come down like a silent snow\n'Til your mind feels as numb as your fingers\nIt was many years ago\nOn the coast of Gondwanaland\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Conquers shining on the ground,\nThe air is cooler\nAnd i feel like i just started uni\nWalking backwards to my van\nYour at your window,\nAnd im tripping every time i think of\n\nLying in your attic\nI can feel the static\nThe storm has broken, Heavens open\n\nSend my body out to work\nBut leave my senses\nIn orbit over south east London\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Oh well her eyes they hypnotised\nLike a pair of headlights\nAnd I remember how she crashed\nHeadlong into my life\nSo I said now close those eyes\nStick a pin into this map\nAnd then she said now look around\nBecause there'll be no looking back\n\nOh but I've been looking since that day\nSince the day we parted\nBut you don't find happiness\nWhen you're searching for it\nAnd I might have realised\nI was wasting precious time\nBut I never had the chance to change the batteries in my watch\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Six a.m. you left me for the last time\nOn my doorstep blinking in the sunshine\nBlamed and framed I'm frozen in the picture\nHanging in the space you left inside me\nClimbed upstairs into the final scene\nWaiting for the credits to appear\nFor all the years that I've been starring\nStarring in a film with you and leading\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
