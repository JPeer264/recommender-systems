        "When I seen him in the dance club\nNo lie, boost on me chanser\nAnd all he had to do is glance up\nIn VIP he was lookin like a fanster\nTo get a dance usually pay for\nDollar bills like a fill, gotta get a rank for it\nHe wanna come speak, I gave him one wink\nWalked up, whispered and he told me some things\nYou out this world, shorty outer space\nWanna share your world but I kinda feel outta place\nI know they wanna win you but it's not a race\nSo many get at you when I know you runnin out of mace\nA bad boy but I can tell you like me by the Buy the drink, badda bing, hop out the club\nBut girl you got me in this singing how to love\nLet me hold your phone, put my number in and dial it up\n\nOut of all the girls I've seen you're the one (you're the one)\nBaby what you're showin me\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nStay here forever, stay here forever\nI rather stay here forever, stay here forever\nHow did I fall in love? How did I fall in love?\nFall in love in the club like this\n\nBlack beauty, body like a stallion\nWant me to wear his chain, he offering medallions\nVIP in the club, fly with a dove\nRun this in his cape 'cause I'm singing how to love\nYou see I got a table, he's in the case ace\nMy friends drink it up but I don't really like the taste\nThe thrill in the chase, so I make him wait\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
