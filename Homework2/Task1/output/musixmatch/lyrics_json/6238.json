        "I dreamt of a fever,\none that would cure me of this cold, winter-set heart\nWith heat to melt these frozen tears burned with reasons as to carry on\n\nInto these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow\nBut I swear that I would follow anything\njust get me out of here\n\nBut you get six months to adapt\nand you get two more to leave town\nAnd in the event that you do adapt\nwe still might not want you around\n\nBut I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose\nbut I know that that's impossible now\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",

        "The city has sex with itself I suppose\nAs the concrete collides while the scenery grows\nAnd the lonely once bandaged lay fully exposed\nHaving undressed their wounds for each other\nAnd there's a boy in a basement with a four track machine\nHe's been strumming and screaming all night down there\nThe tape hiss will cover the words that he sings\nBut they say it's better to bury your sadness\nIn a graveyard or garden that waits for the spring\nTo awake from its sleep and burst into green\nWell, I've cried\nAnd you would think I'd feel better for it\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",

        "I spent a week drinking the sunlight of Winnetka, California\nWhere they understand the weight of human hearts\nSee, sorrow gets too heavy and joy it tends to hold you\nWith the fear that it eventually departs\nAnd the truth is I've been dreaming of some tired tranquil place\nWhere the weather won't get trapped inside my bones\nAnd if all the years of searching find one sympathetic face\nThen it's there I'll plant these seeds and make my home\n\nI spent a day dreaming of dying in Mesa, Arizona\nThe olive green of life had turned to ash\nAnd I felt I was on fire with the things I could have told you\nI just assumed that you eventually would ask\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
