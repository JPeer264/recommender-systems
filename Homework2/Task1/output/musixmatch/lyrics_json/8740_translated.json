        "Want you to know I go for your squeezin'\nWant you to know it really is pleasin'\nWant you to know I ain't for no teasin'\n\nTreat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight\nJust squeeze me but please don't tease me\nI get sentimental when you hold me tight\nJust squeeze me but please don't tease me\nMissing you since you went away\nSinging the blues away each day\n...\n\n", 
        "I am not such a clever one about the latest fads\nI admit I was never one adored by local lads\nNot that I ever tried to be a saint\nI'm the type that they classify as quaint\n\nI'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight\nI love the old fashioned things\nThe sound of rain upon a window pane\n...\n\n", 
        "Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by?\nWhy shouldn't I know of love?\nWhy wait around when each age has a sage who has sung\nThat upon this earth love is all that is really worth thinking of?\n\nIt must be fun, lots of fun\n...\n\n", 
        "You are to me everything, my life to be everything\nWhen in my sleep you appear, the skies of deep blue appear\n...\n\n", 
        "You're mean to me\nWhy must you be mean to me\nDear, honey, it seems to me\nYou like to see me cryin'\n\nI don't know why I stay home each night\nWhen you say you'll phone, you don't\nAnd I'm left alone singing the blues inside\n\n...\n\n", 
        "So close your eyes,\nfor that's a lovely way to be.\nOh where I'm fixed your alone was meant to see.\nThe fundamental loveliness grows,\nwhenever two can dream a dream together.\n\nYou can't deny,\ndon't try to fight the rising sea.\nDon't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me.\nThe fundamental loveliness grows,\n...\n\n", 
        "Was a sunny day\nNot a cloud was in the sky\nNot a negative word was heard\nFrom the people passing by\n'Twas a sunny day\nAll the birdies in the trees\nAnd the radio's singing song\nAll the favorite melodies\n\nHe was a navy man\nstationed in Newport News\nShe was a highschool queen\nwith nothing left to lose\n...\n\n", 
        "Have you anything to say to me?\nWon't you tell me where my love can be?\nIs there a meadow in the mist\nWhere someone's waiting to be kissed?\n\nHave you seen a valley green with spring?\nWhere my heart can go a journeying\nOver the shadows and the rain\nTo a blossom covered lane\n...\n\n", 
        "On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love\nOn every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard\nCould break my heart without a word singing a song of love\n\nA song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo\nA song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know\n...\n\n", 
        "A country dance was being held in a garden\nI felt a bump and heard an \"Oh, beg your pardon\"\nSuddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams\nAll around a pug-nosed dream\n\nThe music started and was I the perplexed one\n...\n\n"
