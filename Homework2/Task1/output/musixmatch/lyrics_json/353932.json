        "the season's finally turned\nand i'm walking down to work\ncause there's much left to be earned in these hours\nthe snow has finally learned\nthat she's relinquishing the dirt\ni'm so incensed to see the earth that i stop and cry out:\n\nLady Teresa\ncould you find me forgiveness?\ni would lay down beneath it\nand cry in your kisses\nAve Natura,\nwith the sun as my witness\ni cannot resist it,\n...\n\n",

Mediocrity and your self pity,\nThey were stealing a kiss, look at their lips, still shiny\nDid you notice that happiness\nHappens less the more often you stop to find where it's been hiding\nYou say, \"It's not my fault that I get so low\nThere's a weight on my soul that just keeps pulling me down,\nIt's pulling me down, I swear it\"\n\nSo come on by my house and unleash me your monsters\nWith you at the healm we'll go crashing around together\nDon't mistake some initial hate for something more that cautionary\nCause baby this is love, I'll come down to hell to keep you company\n\n...\n\n",
