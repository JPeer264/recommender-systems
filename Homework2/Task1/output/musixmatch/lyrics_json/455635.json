        "I got a funny feeling no ones ever put you in your place\nOr spit the bullshit right back in your face\nYou never had an ounce of promise within you\nEvery word you says a lie so please don't continue\nYou bitch\nI'm too good for someone like you anyway\nBecause girls like you are the absolute worst\nI really tried to like you but you messed it up first\nBecause girls like you are as bad as they come\nGo crawl back to wherever you came from\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "It's like they need two separate planets to make it stop.\n\nThe boy who was a hero became the shame.\nThe girl who took it all lost everything.\nShe sent a message, she tried to talk,\nthere was something that she needed to know.\n\nBut now was not the best time,\nthe boy was drunk at a metal show.\n\nAt least she's trying.\nAnd maybe what he told her was all she ever needed to hear, anyhow.\n\nAnd maybe someday on a cloud,\ntheir last laugh will be heard awfully loud\n'cause maybe in the end, they'll win.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "I packed my bags and looked to the west\nKissed her picture twenty times\nTake some clothes and a deep breath\nGo commit the perfect crime\n\nI didn't ask for much but now it's much too late\nIf she can't help me now then there's no time to waste\nI will not fail us now, if you just wait you'll see\nI will not let us down, I will get myself free\nI will get myself free as the day that you found me\nBefore I got caught in this mess that's around me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
