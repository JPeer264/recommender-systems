        "Night time slows\nRaindrops, splash rainbows\nPerhaps someone you know\nCould sparkle and shine\n\nAs day's dreams slide\nTo colour from shadow\nPicture the moon's glow\nThat dazzles my eyes\nAnd I love you\n\nJust lying smiling in the dark\nShooting star round your heart\nDreams come bouncing in your head\nPure and simple everytime\nNow you're crying in your sleep\nI wish you'd never learnt to weep\nDon't sell the dreams you should be\nKeeping pure and simple everytime\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
