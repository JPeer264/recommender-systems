        "We're falling\nFading\nGonna fade out\nSurrender searching\nMaking it count\nHolding hoping\nNever enough\nOne last moment\n\nAs the stars die out\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Walking down the highway traffics coming my way\nall I see are flashing lights\nPeople wearing blue suits wanna know the real truth\nhow many did I have tonight?\nLooking at the wreckage anyone would guess that all inside had died\nBut I'm alive\n\nWake up in a strange place angels over my head\none of them is shouting clear\n1000 bolts of lightning bring me back to life\nand it's a miracle that I'm still here\nAs I'm coming to life screaming out for you I need you by my side\nNow I'm alive\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Hard wind blows as the night is born\nAnd the dark feels so, safe\nMy body urge for that beat to start\nCause it's too hard to wait\nWe're going out tonight\nWith something to prove\nTake to the streets and let our demons loose\n\nYour body moves to the boom boom boom\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
