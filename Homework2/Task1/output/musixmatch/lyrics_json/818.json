        "There's too much work and I'm spent\nThere's too much pressure and I admit\nI got no time to move ahead\nHave you heard one thing that I've said\n\nAnd all these little things in life they all create this haze\nThere's too many things to get done, and I'm running out of days\n\n...\n\n", 
        "A hundred days have made me older\nSince the last time that I saw your pretty face\nA thousand lies have made me colder\nAnd I don't think I can look at this the same\n\nBut all the miles that separate\nDisappear now when I'm dreaming of your face\n\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\nI think about you, baby\nAnd I dream about you all the time\nI'm here without you, baby\n\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\n...\n\n", 
        "He spends his nights in California\nWatching the stars on the big screen\nAnd then he lies awake and he wonders\nWhy can't that be me?\n\n'Cause in his life he is filled\nWith all these good intentions\nHe\u00b4s left a lot of things\nHe\u00b4d rather not mention right now\nJust before he says goodnight\nHe looks up with a little smile at me\nAnd he says\n\n\"If I could be like that\nWell I would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\"\nIf I could be like that\nWhat would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nNow in dreams we run\n\n...\n\n",

        "The shades gone up\nMothers staring down\nShe don't know where he's been\nOr how long he's been out\n\nShe said 'Boy I'm tired of waiting up while your out with your friends'\nHe said 'Mom im tired and im living my life the best way that I can'\n\nCause I'm trying to be somebody\nI'm not trying to be somebody else\nThis life is mine I'm living\nDon't you know me? I wont ever let you down\n\nThe day has come\nThe sun is moving on\nShe don't know where he'll go\n...\n\n", 
        "Living risky, never scared\nWander closer to the edge\nNothing valued think no fear\nAlways wondering why youre here\n\nAll your purposes are gone\nNothings right and nothings wrong\nNothing ventured, nothing gained\nFeel no sorrow, feel no pain\n\nKiss me while Im still alive\nKill me while I kiss the sky\nLet me die on my own terms\nLet me live and let me learn\n\nNow Ill follow my own way\n...\n\n",

        "I hope you're doing fine out there without me\nCause I'm not doing so good without you\nThe things I thought you'd never know about me\nWere the things I guess you always understood\n\nSo how could I have been so blind for all these years?\nGuess I only see the truth through all this fear\nAnd living without you\n\nAnd everything I have in this world\nAnd all that I'll ever be\nIt could all fall down around me.\nJust as long as I have you\nRight here by me.\n\nI can't take another day without you\n...\n\n", 
        "Nevermind the face you put on\nIn front of me\nNevermind the pain\nThat you've put me through\n\nCause every little thing you say\nAnd every little thing you do\nMakes me doubt all of this\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nLook what you did\nIs this who you wanted me to be?\nWell it's not me... no\n\nLook what you did\nIs this how you wanted this to be?\nThis life you gave away\n...\n\n", 
        "I woke up today in London\nAs the plane was touching down\nAnd all I could think about was Monday\nAnd maybe I'd be back around\nIf this keeps me away much longer\nI don't know what I would do\nYou've got to understand it's a hard life\nThat I'm going through\n\nAnd when the night falls in around me\nI don't think I'll make it through\nI'll use your light to guide the way\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind\nI left my body lyin somewhere in the sence of time\nBut I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon\nI feel there's nothing I can do\n\nyea\n\nI watched the world float to the dark side of the moon\n...\n\n", 
        "Breathe in right away, nothing seems\nto fill this place\nI need this every time, take your\nlies get off my case\nSome day I will find, a love that flows\nThrough me like this\nThis will fall away, this will fall away\n\nYou're getting closer, to pushing me\nOff of life's little edge\nCause I'm a loser and sooner or later\nYou know I'll be dead\nYou're getting closer, you're holding the\nRope and I'm taking the fall\nCause I'm a loser, I'm a loser, yeah\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Living risky, never scared, wander\nCloser to the edge\nNothing valued think no fear, always\nWondering why you're here\nAll your purposes are gone, nothing's\nRight and nothing's wrong\nNothing ventured, nothing gained\nFeel no sorrow, feel no pain\nKiss me while I'm still alive\nKill me while I kiss the sky\nLet me die on my own terms, let me\nLive and let me learn\nNow I'll follow my own way, and I'll\n...\n\n", 
        "Rubber headed motor junky\nRun me down and try to stomp me\nThrow my life away and I'll be worthless just like you\nSomewhere now a baby's crying\nDown the road his mother's dying\nShot a line and blew her mind and now she's turnin' blue\n\nDon't you throw your life away\nJust wait until another day\nDon't you throw your life away\nCause baby I can feel it\n...\n\n",

        "At night the corpses rise\nAnd leave a srench of rotten life\nEagerly the stagger forth\nTo find a friend to gripe\nCopulating in the grounds\nOf their eternal home\nRegurgitate ejaculations\nOn their old tomb stones\nDead Love - There's love amongst the\nDead Love - There's love amongst the dead\nLicking at their blackened limbs\n...\n\n", 
        "Save me now\nFalling to pieces\nLosing control\nLosing achievements\nThis world chooses other than me\nForget this world\nIt's worse than me\n\n\nIt's all here and I've got it together\nI'm losing it all and I'm throwing away again\nI can't seem just to see tomorrow\nBut I can see that it's wasted me\n...\n\n", 
        "Cloud in my mind,\nTrouble my thoughts.\nYour silence is beauty,\nbut your beauty is lost.\nThere's a sandy man hidden.\nYou seven times think\nthat you're very tired and ridden,\nbut you never once blink.\n\nThere's a man in my mind,\nkickin' in the walls.\nTrailin' my innocence,\n...\n\n", 
        "They blazed a trail I dared to run\nThey built this world and I have come\nI need another, like a brother\nFor a crying shoulder\n\nAnd this could be the last time\nYou will stand by my side\nWell, I can feel my soul, it's bleeding\nWill you fly with me this evening?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She says, \"I've got something to say\"\nShe knows, that what she says will change everything\nShe's laid, through too many sleepless nights\nShe's cryin', she's cryin', she's cryin'\n\nMother, that man took my soul away\nFather, how could you ever treat me this way?\nBrother, don't ever let him do this again\nThis time it's over I'm gonna make it end\n\nNow it's over and the old man is dead\nLyin' on the ground, bullet in his head\n...\n\n"
