        "Carry me away from this dark and lonely room\nLight me in your arms - all I want to know is you\nChase away the darkness with everything you are\nI will find my strength in the beat of your heart\n\nPicture book of memories, how we used to be\nSome people spend a lifetime waiting for their dreams\n...\n\n", 
        "River of dreams take me with you tonight\nLying in your arms we'll drift to\nIslands of wonder that gleam and glow\nunder the stars\nAs we guide through the dark\nTo the heart of the night\n\nRiver of dreams gently hold me again\nI remember all you told me\n...\n\n",

        "Let your arms enfold us\nThrough the dark of night\nWill your angels hold us\nTill we see the light\n\nHush, lay down your troubled mind\nThe day has vanished and left us behind\nAnd the wind - whispering soft lullabies\n...\n\n",

        "In the wavering balance Desire fluctuates with each other lascivious love and modesty. But I choose what I see ...", 
        "When the sea falls from the shore\nAs the light sinks low, will I see you anymore\nAs the rain falls from the sky\nCan I bring you back from a distant lullaby\n\nShow me your vision\nThe story behind\nTwo lights are rising and burning as one\n\nIn the deep blue of the night\nShine the millions of stars and my spirit burning bright\nSpinning on, into the sun, flying higher\n...\n\n",

        "Out on the wiley, windy moors\nWe'd roll and fall in green\nYou had a temper, like my jealousy\nToo hot, too greedy\nHow could you leave me\nWhen I needed to possess you?\nI hated you, and loved you too\n\nBad dreams in the night\nYou told me I was going to lose the fight\nLeave behind my wuthering, wuthering\nWuthering Heights\n\nHeathcliff, it's me, your Cathy, I've come home\nI'm so cold, let me in your window\n...\n\n", 
        "My heart and I have wandered aimlessly\nBeneath the weeping willow searching for the sun\nTime after time we've met each other in a dream\nAnd we have gazed upon the miracle of love\n\nMy heart and I have heard the angels sing\nAnd we have found upon life's broken wing\n...\n\n"
