        "My heart bleeds and the anger inside me dwells\nFrom an emotion so absent it burns.\nOur feelings will turn into ashes.\nShe said: Its better if I leave...\n\nBut tonight you will die.\nYou will never wake up again.\nMy hope is my failure.\n\nWhy should I listen when nothing is said?\nCave-in when emotions are dead?\nIts too late to speak from your heart anyway\nIts better if you bleed.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

You have to wake up, you have to wake up and see and you will\nFind all the answers standing in front of you.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
