        "Cast Off\n\nI broke the champagne glass across your hull and watched you disembark\nTurn on your restless lights who see suited ones who saw you sail into the dark\nFall back to banner here ickered on the harbor\nI'm scared of holy rolling beggars\nI plan to land one to one you'd be a new love shaker\n...\n\n", 
        "Whats your name summer girl?\nWill you stay until september comes?\nAnd takes it's sun from your blonde hair\n\nWhose your type summer girl?\nWho'll hold you tight till the fall comes?\nAnd your life takes you away\n\nI remember seeing you\nBefore the summer sun touched your pale skin\nAnd now you're golden\n...\n\n", 
        "What a surprise\nWhat a surprise\nHow quickly summer's over\nWhat a surprise\nWhat a good disguise\nI didn't say goodbye\nWhat a surprise\nFeel like I'm at home again\nBack inside my mother's arms\nLights are shining on me again\nPassing notes with my best friends\nHanging back at class again\nMaybe this year I'll find the girl\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh yeah we've got somewhere to go tonight\nOh yeah we've got somewhere to go\nTie dyed undercurrent paradise\nYou got sequins in your eyes\nJust turn it up to turn me on\nThe sun has never seen the night like us\n\n(one two three four)\n\nThe only way you can make me stay is if you give me more so I can stay\nthis way\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me go\nI don't wanna be your hero\nI don't wanna be your big man\nI just wanna fight with everyone else\n\nYou're a masquerade\nI don't wanna be a part of your parade\nEveryone deserves a chance to\nWalk with everyone else\n\nWhile holding down\nA job to keep my girl around\n...\n\n", 
        "All the trees and the dead leaves\nit must be fall-ing in love with you\n\nall the sand in my pockets hand\ni wish you'd start hanging out with me\n\nbaby won't you come with me\nthere's someplace that i wanna be\nhelp me out by holding onto my hand\nthe stars are out, the crowd's thinned out\nwalk with me down to the water\nand the horizon will be the only thing we'll see\n...\n\n", 
        "Who sleeps in beds when you've got the sunrise\nWasting time watching informercials live on channel 9\nUs and Billy Mays, nowhere else to rile\nStealing blankets, sleeping in a pile\n\nThey made the sunrise for people like us\nSo we have an excuse as to why we're still up\nJust so we can feel a little bit better\nAbout the neighbor's angry letter on our door step\nOn our door f*cking step\n\nWent to the house of some friends that I just met\n...\n\n"
