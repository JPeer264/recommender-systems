        "Ooh Ooh Ooh\nOoh Ooh Ooh\n\nYou want me to be more forceful.\nYou say that I could get there.\nYour head's leaning on my shoulder.\nBut I don't know what it's doing there.\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "We folk, good folk, trooping all together,\nGreen jacket, red cap and a white house feather.\nDown along the rocky shores,\nWe live amongst the mud pores\nEating crispy pancakes made from yellow tide foam.\n\nChorus\nUp the Airy Mountain,\n...\n\n", 
        "If you were my first love, I wouldn't be surprised,\nTo get at your feeling, looking into your eyes.\nBut I've been around I knew how to fight before\nBut never so high before, and never so far.\n\nChorus\nJumping Jehosaphat, what have you done?\nFeel like an allycat, out in the sun.\n...\n\n", 
        "You got your name about, flying around acting free.\nBut I could never doubt\nThat you'd come back to me.\nSaid you're having a ball,\nDidn't want me to call.\nBut I know what I know\nCan''t let it go\nCan't let it go\n\nI never hear the sound of your soft voice any more.\nI'm gonna be around when your feet hit the floor.\n...\n\n"
