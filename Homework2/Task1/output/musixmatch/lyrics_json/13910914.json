        "I have walked behind you\nAssumed power in the dead of night\nHe was a funeral hymn\nComposed of fleeting fires\n\nBring you down\nI\u2019ll keep it brief\nBring you down\nI\u2019ll keep it brief\nBring you down\nI\u2019ll keep it brief\n\nLay in bed\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Anything we should know about your change?\nHe left his mark upon my skin\nSaid I've lost my loose heart\nTo the cold, cold wind\nSwallow me, hunted down\nI didn't know I've sent him out\nCross your heart\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Don't you wait on me, I'll shoot you down\nKeep your eyes closed, your ear to the ground\nPick up in the middle of the night\nKill the silence, I can't bear to speak\nHead for the heart, does it break\nWords may fall, the body remains\nAnd every map is blank\n\nWhen my words head for the cracks\nWill you have my back?\nWe were good children\nDarling, let it out\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
