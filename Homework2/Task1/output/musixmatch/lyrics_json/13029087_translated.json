        "As i walk through these streets on my own\nI decide love won't hurt me no more\nIt feels like your already gone\nYou're here but I'm so alone\n\nI wish I know you better wish I know you better tonight\nBut your just a stranger starring at me in the light\n\nI miss you forever and a day\nSo set up forever and away\nYou have always known the beat of my heart\nYou have always own the beat of my heart\n\nI walk through these steers on my own\nI find no place to belong\n\nI wish I know you better wish I know you better tonight\n...\n\n"
