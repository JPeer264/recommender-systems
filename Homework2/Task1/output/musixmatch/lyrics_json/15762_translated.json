        "They come from the farms and the factories too\nAnd they all soon forget who they are.\n\nThe cares of today are soon washed away\nAs they sit at a stool by the bar.\nThe girl with green eyes in the rolling stones shirt\nDoesn't look like she works on the land.\n...\n\n", 
        "When the sun shines on the mountain\nAnd the night is on the run\nIt's a new day\nIt's a new way\nAnd I fly up to the sun\n\nI can feel the morning sunlight\nI can smell the new-mown hay\nI can hear God's voice is calling\nFor my golden sky light way\n\n...\n\n"
