        "Tall ships sail the oceans, on the blue horizon\nRunning with the Trade Winds, to some far off distant shore\nMail trains whistle in the night, racing through the darkness\nSparks that set the track alight, as they rush towards the dawn\n\nIt's a lovely day, I'm dreaming in my garden\n...\n\n", 
        "A shooting star fell down to earth\nLightning cracked the sky\nSomething weird is happening\nSomething I can't deny\n\nA strange kind of magic\nRunning through my brain\nFeel I'm in heaven\nOr going insane\n\n'Cause everytime we touch\nI get this feeling\nAnd everytime we kiss\nI swear, I could fly\n\nCan't you hear my heart beat fast\nI want this to last\nNeed you by my side\n\n'Cause everytime we touch\nI feel the static\nAnd everytime we kiss\nI reach for the sky\n\nCan't you hear my heart beat so\nI can't let you go\nWant you in my life\n...\n\n", 
        "Lucy don't be sad\nIt hurts to see you cry, hurts to see you blue\nWipe your tear filled eyes\nLet me see you smile, like you used to do\n\nOh Lucy, believe me when I say\nOh Lucy, I'll never turn away\n\nLucy don't be scared\n...\n\n", 
        "She had a sulky smile\nShe took a standard pose as she presented herself\nShe had sultry eyes\nShe made it perfectly plain that she was his for a price\n\nBut he said leave me alone I'm a family man\nAnd my bark is much worse than my bite\nHe said leave me alone I'm a family man\nIf you push me too far I just might\n\nShe wore hurt surprise\nAs she re-checked her make-up to protect herself\nShe showed less than pride\nShe made it totally clear that she was his for a price\n\nBut he said leave me alone I'm a family man\nAnd my bark is much worse than my bite\nPlease just leave me alone I'm a family man\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm standing sideways to the sky\nI've been looking to the wind\nIt seems to travel easy going solo\nWhat's the twinkling of an eye\nOr the touch of someone's hand\nIf you just can't get there on your own\n\nYou said you just had to leave\nThen you turned on right around\nYou're stealing all my time like you steal my logic\nI can't say what I believe, 'cos I feel I've lost my ground\nI can't trust in love I can't believe in magic\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Now I understand, life doesn't always go as planned\nBut with every closing door, there's always something more\nThe future's in our hands\n\nI watch the morning sun arise, the start of one more empty day\nThis longing never seems to fade, like all those plans we made\nMy tears have washed away\n...\n\n", 
        "You with the sad eyes\nDon't be discouraged though I realise\nIt's so hard to take courage\nIn a world for the people\nYou can lose sight of it\nAnd the darkness inside you\nMakes you feel so small\n\nI see your true colours shining through\nYour true colours, that's why I love you\nDon't be afraid to let them show\nYour true colours, true colours\n...\n\n", 
        "The last that ever she saw him\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nHe passed on worried and warning\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\n\nLost in a riddle that Saturday night\nFar away on the other side\nHe was caught in the middle of a desperate fight\nAnd she couldn't find how to push through\n\nThe trees that whisper in the evening\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nSing a song of sorrow and grieving\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\n\nAll she saw was a silhouette of a gun\n...\n\n", 
        "Come with me, on a ride through the night sky\nCome with me, by my side you will lie\n\nI was looking, always searching\nCouldn't find the key\nAll I need to bring you back to me\nIn your own time\nIn your own time\n\nCome with me, to the stars we will fly\n...\n\n", 
        "If I could have a day or two\nJust to spend some time with you\nI think I would\nAnd if I could have a month or two\nJust to spend my time with you\nI think I would\n\nBut the light's fading in the distance\nI drive my weary way home\nSkylight is red with all the citylights\nAnd driving's such a long way home\n\nI've been saving half the year\n...\n\n", 
        "Lying in my bed alone\nAnd whispering your name,\nWonder where you are tonight\nAnd do you feel the same,\nLetting my thoughts fly to where\nYou might be,\nSharing the secret that took you from me.\n\nHeart is beating faster with\nThe memory of your touch\nTry to ease this loneliness\nI'm missing you so much\nI'm with you when sleep comes\nI find you in dreams\nBut wake to confusion\nIt's not as it seems\n\nI'm waiting for you,\nThose words I still hear you say,\nBut it seems like a lifetime\nSince you went away,\nThese chains round my heart\nAnd they'll just wont let me feel,\nUntil you return I will never be free,\nI hear you call - wait for me.\n\nDo you still remember by the ocean,\nOh so blue,\n...\n\n",

        "How can I show you what I feel when we're together\nWhen nothing I can do can seem to make it right\nI always wanted perfect love to last forever\nNow all that I can see is the writing on the wall\nThen in that moment when I think we just can't make it\nI know you'll never let me down\nYou'll never lose\nJust look in my direction\nDon't try to choose\nIt's out of your control\nYou'll never lose\nI long for your affection\nYou'll never lose\n...\n\n"
