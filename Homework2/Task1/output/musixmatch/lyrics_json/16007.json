        "When the pressure's coming down on you\nWhen it's time for them to pull you through\nWhen this thing has got a hold on you\nWhen you feel this place is almost through\nShout at the sky\nShout at the sky\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Is it true, when they say it's alright\nIn a world which is made up of lies\nTakes a lot of courage, takes a lot of pride\nHolding onto something when you're falling down inside\nI have only to open my eyes\nI'm running down the road, I'm running down the road\n...\n\n", 
        "On the other side looking in\nYou thought you were pretty smart but you're so dim\nI don't mind I don't care what they say\n...\n\n", 
        "On the telephone I hear your ringing tones\nYou've been short changed, there's only you to blame\nBecause, you only get what you pay for\n...\n\n", 
        "Take the truth with a broken smile\nEven though I know it killing me inside\nAnd there's something wrong by the way things are\nStill I carry on with the same old lies\n\nYou've gotta save my soul\n...\n\n"
