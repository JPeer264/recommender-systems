        "Simple minded brain, for now you succumb\nNothing changes your way\nThis world insists to be the same\nBased on our mistakes\nThe flowers fade along the road\nDon't blindfold your eyes,\nSo loneliness becomes the law\nOf a senseless life\n\nFollow your steps and you will find\nThe unknown ways are on your mind\nNeed nothing else than just your pride\nTo get there... (Go!)\n\nNow you have to face another day\nYou won't be alone\nThis life is forcing us to stay\n- For how long?\n...\n\n", 
        "Across the ocean at the very end of the sea\nThere's a new wild land still untouched by the beauty of our Lord and his love\nOn the other side of the ocean\nThere's a wild man still living free\nAnd our mission's to teach him the glory of our Mother Church\nAnd make him believe that one day\nEverything shall have to change\nThe poor will be rich tustice will rule in peace and nothing will count but our souls\n\nAt the back of the planet on the very edge of the world\nThere's a kingdom to establish and laws to obey and respect\nThe sake of mankind will make sure\nEverything shall have to change\nThe poor will be rich, justice will rule in peace\nAnd we shall be the ones who hide behind the wall of hidden lies\n\nBehind the cross\n...\n\n", 
        "Male sit tibi tenebrarum rex\nab initio ad finem sacra ultio\ncruenta pugna et epicus furor\ncontra mali discipulos\n\nAd perpetuam gloriam lucis\nfuror ira tenax\ncontra iniuriam et ruinam\nrabies ira tenax\n\nMale sit tibi tenebrarum rex\ncruentus rex\n\nDemons of abyss wait for my pride\non wings of glory I'll fly brave and wild\nI'll stop your madness your thirst for blood\nto bring them peace where love must reign\n\nA while ago the elder told dark will fall again\n...\n\n", 
        "The sea is like a sheet\nof glass, in this strange night,\nbut I'm so tired\nas not be able to think.\nI pray, I pray God it won't happen again.\nStupid tragedy.\nSword! I don't know where to begin!\nOh mother!...\n\nWarrior\n...\n\n", 
        "These days I can not find\nA way back of the dark\nI lost my senses\n\nIn my reflection a shadow of the man\nI'm just a stranger to myself\n\nNo, the silence, keeps coming!\n\nPlease don't cry again\nPlease don't shed the tear\nCuz I can't bear to face what I did\nLet me take your hand\nPlease let me back to your side\nIn your eyes I see what I've become!\n...\n\n", 
        "AQUA!\n\nTime for you reflection\nWhat's the promise you have made?\nDestruction of your pride\nand reconstruction of my name\nYou betrayed me where's your bravery?\nNow you face your doom\nYour fate will be tranced by the spear\nThat went tearing through\n\nWhen you hear the winds of revenge\n\nAll of the distance and the chains\nYou put around my damned soul\nRight now it's all finished\nI'm building your new world\n...\n\n", 
        "Long ago, the same sky above;\n\"It's lonesome when the sun goes down\"\nA day had come when we were like one:\n- Weapons up, never surrender!\n\nOh, I saw the gleams of gold\nWe'd kill and die conquering a virgin world\nThe hold corrupted by the honour\n\nLiving forevermore, leaving today\nBack to my place, I've got\nNothing to say!\n\nGuilt and shame, it's all so insane\nPagan gods die with no defence\n...\n\n", 
        "Been here for so long\nOn the morrow I'll dare\nSilent and distant\nReaching out, unaware\nStealing the whispers\nFrom my deepest request\n\nAnd you watch me\nWaiting for something new\nMy hands, as empty\nAs my body and soul\nCould keep pretending\nBut in the heart I'd be gone...\n\nStill stare at my face\nBut lost seem your eyes\nKeep hold of the sails\n...\n\n", 
        "Somehow I turn around and see\nMy nerves break down inside\nMaybe you might know much more than me\nSo tell me what is right to say\n\nDown the weakness of my soul\nLie the secrets, and I know\nThere's something pushing back\nWish my hands could turn to gold\nAnd my heart would break the cold\nTo give my thoughts some sense\n\nThe turn is close, new century\nStill people think they're kings\nNow you've got your voice,\nYour own speech\n...\n\n", 
        "We were born in a Golden Age\nBeyond the creed\nBlown with the winds to meet\nThe ones who creep\nAnd pray\nUnshold feet traces on fresh sand\nA map unfold\nSpreading out knowledge,\nMagic and love\nAnd then\n\n... ooh, and then,\n\nCarried by wooden gods\nWe leave toward the sky\n...\n\n", 
        "Sat beside the meadow\nWatching weeds grow\nCleaned up all the ashes\nOf my soul\n\nWrote down my own sentence\nNow you take your way\nFades the last remembrance\nOf your lovely pretty face\n\nI, after all,\nJust a lonely man - a lonely heart!\n\nWorking on the future\nFloating on fate\n...\n\n", 
        "Eyes of Christ\n\nDemian poor child was raised on the gutter\nDigs in thrashcans to kill the hunger\nWhen your mouth is so full of promisse\nAll I see is one empty hand\n\nThe world may turn but\nsome things never change\n\nUptown princess a life inside cages\nWearing diamonds around the neck\nI know bibles are full of fair words\nBut nothing's worth more\nThan what to care\n\n...\n\n", 
        "\"Salve, salve Iemanj\u00e1,\nSalve Jana\u00edna\nE tudo o que se fez na \u00e1gua\nJogam flores para o mar\nDeus salve a Rainha\nE o meu passo nessa esfera...\"\n\nAll I see floats with the wind\nAll the miracles of the water\nAre the miracles never seen\nSomehow my life now begins\nThis music that's been played through time\nNow starts to reach my feet\nFeels like the flood of my needs\nFrom the harmony of forever\nSound the melodies of the sea\nAnd you will know on the way\nI'm coming back to my enemies\nI'm turning around I'll be\nJust coming back to my last days\nI'm coming back to the sea!\n\nSo... won't you come with me, my friend?\nThrills... like we had before\nHope... never showing up the same\nFor a lonely man\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Deep Blue\n\nThree cliffs there stand\nHigh above where high winds howl\nSurrounding silence\nThree birds climb, then turn to fall\n\nWaiting for someday when the ocean and sky\n...\n\n", 
        "Remember the first time you've faced the dark\nWhy were you so afraid?\nHiding so many secrets inside\nWhen fearshave got to be tamed\n\nI promisse I'll still be there\nTo keep my promisse\nI'll still be there\n\nTo watch over dreams at night\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh boys, I've seen the old man;\nStraw mask around the forehead\nThe blaze, a blast and the awakening dead\n(The magic seeds will spread...)\n\nThe bleeding warrior, he has fought\n(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till the dawn!)\nAgainst the passion, for the love\n(Serpent skin, a savage scream, don't you believe, it grows and grows...)\n\nOh boys, it's all so easy:\nWarn up the soul\nWhile the body is freezin'!...\n- I swear it!\n...\n\n"
