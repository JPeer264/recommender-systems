        "You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need\nGot to sleep on your toes and when you're on the street\nGot to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed\nThen moving in silently down wind and out of sight\nYou got to strike when the moment is right without thinking\n\nAnd after a while you can work on points for style\nLike the club tie and the firm handshake\nA certain look in the eye and an easy smile\nYou have to be trusted by the people that you lie to\nSo that when they turn their backs on you\nYou'll get the chance to put the knife in\n\nYou gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder\nYou know it's going to get harder, harder and harder as you get older\nYeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south\n...\n\n", 
        "Big man, pig man\nHa ha charade you are\nYou well heeled big wheel\nHa ha charade you are\nAnd when your hand is on your heart\nYou're nearly a good laugh\nAlmost a joker\nWith your head down in the pig bin\nSaying keep on digging\nPig stain on your fat chin\nWhat do you hope to find\nDown in the pig mine\nYou're nearly a laugh\n\nYou're nearly a laugh\n...\n\n", 
        "Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away\nOnly dimly aware of a certain unease in the air.\nYou better watch out\nThere may be dogs about\nI've looked over Jordan, and I have seen\nThings are not what they seem.\n\nWhat do you get for pretending the dangers not real.\nMeek and obedient you follow the leader\nDown well trodden corridors, into the valley of steel.\nWhat a surprise!\nA look of terminal shock in your eyes.\n...\n\n", 
        "You know that I care what happens to you,\nAnd I know that you care for me.\nSo I don't feel alone,\n...\n\n", 
        "Far, far, far away way\nPeople heard him say say\nI will find a way way\nThere will come a day day\nSomething will be done\nThen at last the mighty ship descending on a point of flame\nMade contact with the human race at Mildenhall\n\nNow, now, now is the time time\n...\n\n", 
        "Little by little the night turns around\nCounting the leaves which tremble at dawn\nLotuses lean on each other in yearning\nUnder the eaves the swallow is resting\n\nSet the controls for the heart of the sun\n\nOver the mountain watching the watcher\nBreaking the darkness waking the grapevine\nOne inch of love is one inch of shadow\nLove is the shadow that ripens the wine\nSet the controls for the heart of the sun\n\nThe heart of the sun\nThe heart of the sun\nThe heart of the sun\n...\n\n", 
        "Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg\nHe won it in the war\nIn nineteen forty-four\n\nCorporal Clegg had a medal too\nIn orange, red and blue\nHe found it in the zoo\n\n...\n\n", 
        "He made his way to the border\nIn the shadow, under the trees\nDown by a stream, in a hollow\nTurn your head, feel the breeze\n\nAnd the Red Queen was waiting for the news\nFor the White King to move\nAnd the balance hung upon the head of one who tried\nTo stay within the shadows\nAnd keep his undercover secret tight\n\n...\n\n",

        "Arnold Layne had a strange hobby\nCollecting clothes\nMoonshine, washing line\nThey suit him fine\n\nOn the wall hung a tall mirror\nDistorted view\nSee-through baby blue\nHe dug it\n\nOh Arnold Layne, it's not the same\nTakes two to know\n...\n\n", 
        "Last night I had too much to drink\nSitting in a club with so many fools\nPlaying to rules\nTrying to impress but feeling rather empty\n\nI had another drink\nDrink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink\n\nWhat a way to spend that evening\nThey all turn up with their friends\nPlaying the game\n...\n\n",
