        "You got debts to pay\nYou got a back to break\nAnd no one understands\nThe waves keep rolling\nThey keep rolling\n\nYou got mouths to feed\nYou got a rep to keep\nBut no one understands\nYou can't see dry land\n\nAnd then you wake up from a bad dream\nYou were gonna drown but don't worry now\nCause you'll find your feet\nWe'll walk on water one day\nA miracle\n\nYou had highs and lows\nBut now you can't find no place to go\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "When she turned eighteen she went astray\nWith her brother's dealer, so they say\nShe had the baby yesterday\nPerhaps it's just a rumour\nThey kept her prisoner growing up\nTold her Jesus was enough\nShe's really into dirty stuff\nPerhaps it's just a rumour\nAnd if you asked her she'd say\n\nI'm just tryin' to work out\nHow to be like myself\nI'm just tryin' to work out\nThese cards I've been dealt\n\nSee that girl she's looking great\nShe used to be quite overweight\nShe may not be entirely straight\nPerhaps it's just a rumour\nAlways did as she was told\nApparently she's on the dough\nSpends it all on alcohol\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "We're both there at the same time, we both go\nDon't need to talk to each other, we got codes\nHave a bit too much to drink, say hello\nWe're gonna go home together\nWe really should know better\n\nBut fuck your no strings\nAnd your 'hey I'll ring'\nBut I'm, but I'm imagining things\nNo strings, kinda hope I have twins\nCome on, come on, am I imagining something?\nYou can't win at all\nAnd the trouble with no strings is you can only fall\n\nThey're playing our favourite song\nYou come dance near me but not for long\nYou know sometimes I think you're so immature\nDon't know what trip you're on\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I don't ever wear that dress; it's just collecting dust\nI see the lighter that we shared; it's just begun to rust\nI should've let you know but she was so much better\nBut if I let you know would that make you forget her?\n\nI wish I could tell you but I just run and hide\nI wish I could tell you but it's a thorn in my side\nIf I could find the words to say\nMaybe this pain would go away\nIf I could find the words to say\nWe could move on, we could move on now\n\nIt gets a little hard to sleep knowing you were here\nThis other guy's good for me but you won't disappear\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
