        "Living on the road my friend\nWas gonna keep you free and clean\nNow you wear your skin like iron\nYour breath's as hard as kerosene\nYou weren't your mama's only boy\nBut her favorite one it seems\nShe began to cry when you said goodbye\nAnd sank into your dreams\n\nPancho was a bandit boys\nHis horse was fast as polished steel\nWore his gun outside his pants\nFor all the honest world to feel\nPancho met his match you know\nOn the deserts down in Mexico\nNobody heard his dying words\nThat's the way it goes\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "If I had been born two hundred years ago\nI would have been a sailor, and sailing I would go\nI'd sail around the Capes and across the seven seas and then back home\nIf I had been born two hundred years ago\n\nAnd I would know the waters, and the waters would know me\nI would cut across the waves, and be as happy as can be\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I have to admit that I am one of the many\nWho thought that a guitar would win him a lady.\nMy teenage years, they were a feminine drought,\nAnd I thought that a serenade would help out.\nAnd it seemed to be working for a couple of years \u2013\nI wrote a few songs and they wrought a few tears.\nBut when I hit my twenties, it ran out of steam.\nI seemed to be suffering from romantic fatigue.\n\nAnd I never know which song I should play her \u2013\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I woke up on a sofa in an unfamiliar house,\nSurrounded by sleeping folks that I didn't know.\nOn failing to find my friends, I decided that it was clearly time to go.\nSo I made my way out of the door as quietly as I could \u2013\nThere was no one there I knew to say goodbye \u2013\nSquinting in the sadly sobering sunshine of the Sunday morning light.\n\nI started the night with all my friends and I ended up alone,\nOh yes I started out so happy now I'm hung-over and down.\nIt was about then that I realized I was half-way through\nThe best years of my life.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "It's been eighteen months since I kissed you once,\nSo just saying \u201chi\u201d just isn't going to fly,\nBut if you give me a clue and a minute or two,\nThen I might remember your name.\nAnd I hate to insist that I was really that pissed,\nBut to tell the truth, in my flush of youth,\nI would drown my sight until faces and nights seemed the same.\nAnd a nervous shrug and an awkward hug\nWon't get me out of the hole that I've dug,\nSo I slip the noose with a poor excuse\nAnd talk to someone, anyone else.\nAnd I sit with my friends and I try to pretend\nThat I never did that sort of thing again,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I remember the day - the day when I had to take you to the airport\nAnd put you on a plane, and so you left me.\nLeft me alone on an empty tube train, deep under the ground,\nWhile you were bathed in sunlight, high above the clouds.\n\nI needed you here to be my sunshine in London town.\nCalifornia's had more than its fair share.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "A free house, a sound-system and a fridge full of beer;\nI've known how this story ends for a good few years.\nThe night lays out before my eyes, there's no new faces, no surprises.\nThis town is growing old with me, so I'm making a move.\nEverybody round here's been out with everybody else,\nWhich makes talking to girls hazardous to my health.\nThey've been in this genepool so long they've got wrinkled toes;\nI don't want all her exes to be people I know.\nThere's millions more fish in the sea, so I'm making a move.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I've been trying to find a way that I could say it you -\nSay it you, all that I've been trying to say.\nI've been stuttering my way from here to anywhere -\nAnywhere you can hear me stutter away.\n\nI've been longing for the day, when you would say \"Hey,\nI feel a little fragile today, and I was wondering if I could drop on by?\"\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "From the heart of the Southern Downs, to the North-East London reservoirs,\nFrom the start, the land scaped my sound, before I'd ever been to America.\n\nAnd if I knew anybody who played pedal steel guitar,\nI'd get them in my band and then my band would get real far,\nBut I was raised in middle England, and not in Nashville Tennessee,\nAnd the only person in my band is me.\n\nA simple scale on an old guitar, and a punk rock sense of honesty.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Whatever happened to childhood?\nWe're all scared of the kids in our neighboorhood;\nThey're not small, charming and harmless,\nThey're a violent bunch of bastard little shits.\nAnd anyone who looks younger than me\nMakes me check for my wallet, my phone and my keys,\nAnd I'm tired of being tired out\nAlways being on the lookout for thieving gits.\n\nWe're all wondering how we ended up so scared;\nWe spent ten long years teaching our kids not to care\nAnd that \"there's no such thing as society\" anyway,\nAnd all the rich folks act surprised\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "I check that I've got all my things before I leave the house,\nBecause when I'm gone I'm never coming back.\nI'm not being melodramatic, it's just I neither have your number or a key.\nAn evening spent pretending that we're just becoming friends,\nOr this goes any further than going back;\nI'm not being pessimistic, it's just you and I were never meant to be.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "We were only supposed to go out for the night,\nBut it's been a few hours now since it got light -\nWe're a mess, and the worst part is we couldn't care less.\nThere's water in the ash-tray and ash in the sink,\nThe carpet's mostly soaking, but there's nothing to drink -\nWe're a state, and we're starting to regret staying awake.\n\nAnd I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,\nI'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.\nI should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.\nBut then I never was the clever one.\n\nWe were only supposed to go out for the night,\nI did my best to go home but in the end I lost the fight with myself -\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
