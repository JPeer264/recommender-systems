        "I wondered the fields and listen for the sound of drums\nThe colder the ground becomes the closer I get I home\nThe planets not fit to roam but with all the chaos\nBut, when I saw the savages I played the law of averages\nAnd when the river splits in half, I start to lose my wits and laugh\nAnd cry at the same time, there's nothing I can do about it\nEven though I wouldn't doubt it, if the winds began to blow\nAnd carry the sounds of my voice to the lands below\nSo I put my hands around my mouth and hollered to the sunken city\nThat, wallows in the filth of its own drunken pity\nAnd wait to see a signal but a signal is never seen\nEventually fatigue builds inside me exponentially and so I sleep\nAnd dream that I'm able to FLY they will respect a man with wings!\nLater I awake, in agony and learn\nThat while I was sleeping the city had burned\n...\n\n"
