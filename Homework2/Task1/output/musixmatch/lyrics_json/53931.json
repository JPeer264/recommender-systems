        "I'm going back to the time when we owned this town\nDown Powder Mill Lane, in the battlegrounds\nWe were friends and lovers and clueless clowns\n\nI didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you\nWhen we talked about things we were gonna do\nWe were wide-eyed dreamers and wiser too\n\nWe'd go down to the rides on East Parade\nby the lights of the Palace Arcade\nAnd watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\n\nI'm begging you for some sign, but you've still got nothing to say\nDon't turn your back on me, don't walk away\n...\n\n", 
        "You, you have a face of fashion\nA style in the place of passion,\nA rose in the garden.\n\nYou, you look like you really meant it\nTwisting the knife in my chest,\nStamping on what's left.\n\nBut I... never was\nI never... was one for crying\nNever was one for tears\n\nThe map, the map of the world is on you,\n...\n\n", 
        "Wake me, shake me from my sleepiness\nWide-eyed, every tale is taller than the one before\nInside out and upside down\nDon't make a sound\nThe wolf's at the door\nAnd all your streetfighting years\nWon't help you anymore\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There's no believing\nAnd no reason why\nWell I'm superstitious\nAnd I can fly\n(There's nothing to see\nAnd nothing to hide\nI'm scared and surrounded\nI only need a while )\n\nTo float through the ceiling\nAnd into the sky\nCall me what you like\n...\n\n", 
        "You think your days are uneventful\nAnd no one ever thinks about you\nShe goes her own way\nShe goes her own way\n\nYou think your days are ordinary\nAnd no one ever thinks about you\nBut we're all the same\nAnd she can hardly breathe without you\n...\n\n", 
        "I come to, there will be no more drowning\nHelp, colorless and cowering\nYou should understand me\nWhen you're understanding\n\nAnd through all the tears should you be alone\n\nRight back, I hope he will pull through\n...\n\n", 
        "Your face in a dream returns\nOnce in a lifetime comes\nAnd it passes by\nI'm never on your side\nAnd you must be blind\nIf you don't know why\n\n\"She'll always take you for granted\"\nA voice in the back of my mind said\n\"You could be waiting your whole life\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a cold voice on the air\nYou've been looking everywhere\nSomeone to understand your hopes and fears\nWell I've thought about that for many long years\n\nSo I walk through Mansers Shaw\nI don't see you anymore\nWe love to think about the way things were\nBut the time has come and I'm glad it's over\n\nI don't know why I waste my time\n...\n\n", 
        "Something in me was dying\nAnd my heart was heavy as stone\nHard as I was trying\nI never could find, find my way home\nAnd your voice came out of nowhere\n\"Be my friend and give me your hand\nLet's take off together\nAnd then we can live wherever we land\"\n\nSomething in me was broken\nAnd my thoughts were bitter and ill\nMy world was blown open\nAnd I couldn't see and I couldn't feel\nYou said \"Be yourself and think of me\nAnd you'll know there's nothing to fear\nLet's make plans together\n...\n\n", 
        "Down in the old town\nWhen my mind is wandering\nRound empty hallways\nWhen will I be one again?\n\nYou're just making it harder for yourself\nMaking it easy for everyone else\nMaking it easy for me\n\nIn the old town\nYou'll never be in\nAnd you never get out\nYou learn from the family\nYou'll never be in\n...\n\n", 
        "Allemande,\nwhere have you gone,\ndid i know anything about you,\nmany moons,\nhave come and gone,\nthey went so easily without you,\nall alone,\ni said we'd be,\nsorry,\nsorry,\nand so we are,\nAnd day that the way that the way that the wind blows,\n...\n\n", 
        "I believe\nYou might stumble and come closer\n\nI like to wake alone\nTo lie and turn to stone\nComfort me, come to me\nI won't go on\n\nI like to walk along\nTo keep my head screwed on\nWell I'm the best, so well done me\nI won't go on\n\nBelieving, believing\nI believe\nYou might stumble and come closer now\n\nIf I stay then I'm alone\nIf I go then it will mean\nWaiting on my own\nIt's the pattern of my life\nWhen you care and you cannot feel\nAnd you know that it's for real\nYou just leave me on my own\n...\n\n"
