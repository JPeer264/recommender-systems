        "Get your passport and your bikini\nYou need a holiday, come, see me\nI know you're tired of the same old scenery\nAnd I could change all that so easily\nDon't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance\nI'll take you to the south of France\nLike Cannes, if anybody can, I can\nWe can go shopping in Milan\nI just hope you understand, I hope you see it clear\nIt really don't matter how far or near\n'Cause there's no distance that can stop my persistence\nJust a few days of the year\nPlus I've got clout, so let's ride out\nWe ain't gotta fly, we can just drive that\nWe can have a rave or we can hide out\nAnd won't tell nobody, let them find out\nIf you ain't doing nothing let's fly away\nDrive away, get away\nWe can go to the club or hide away\nWe can do what you want to, baby\nIf you ain't doing nothing let's fly away\nDrive away, take a holiday\nWe can go to the club or hide away\nWe can do what you want to, baby\nDon't watch my passport photo\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
