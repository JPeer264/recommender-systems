        "When the snowman brings the snow,\nWell he just might like to know.\nHe's put a great big smile on somebody's face.\nIf you jump into your bed,\nQuickly cover up your head,\nDon't you lock the doors you know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way.\n\nWell I wish it could be Christmas everyday.\nWhen the kids start singing and the band begins to play.\nOh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.\nLet the bells ring out for Christmas.\n\nWhen we're skating in the park,\nIf the storm cloud paints it dark,\nThen your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)", 
        "Ordinance boys should check out their toys\nCos we're going for a jolly cup of tea\nCheer up lads don't forget your bags\nCos we're going for a jolly cup of tea\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)", 
        "When you're walking down\nAnd there's no pavement on the street\nYou see the light, for it's still calling you\nLet it go boy, let it be\n\nWhen you're walking down\nFeeling all screwed up inside\nYour woman waits and she's still waiting for you\nLet it go boy, let it ride\n\nWear a fast gun and you'll be all right\nThrough the fight, stand by me\nWear a fast gun and you'll live tonight\nHolding on, take your place and stand by me\nHolding on, Christian brother stand by me\n\nWhen you're walking down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)"
