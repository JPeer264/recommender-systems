        "Don't you think I'm so strong?\nI can only take the pressure for so long.\nTake your hangups and your pride,\nand lock them all outside.\n\n'Cause love is in the details.\nThe little things, my heart never fails to detect,\nlike lonliness,\nand neglect.\n\nWhat's keepin you from comin' home?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I want to explore you, I'm gonna get under your skin\nSo you can feel me running through your veins\nI want to examine every inch of your frame\nThe pressure points that cause your joy and pain\n\nOur love goes under the knife\nThere is no room for doubt\n\nNow I'm inside you, my hands can feel their way\nFurther inside than I have ever been\nNow I can really mess around with your heart\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
