        "Your name I spoke many times\nAlone in the darkness in the night\nAnd prayed a thousand prayers\nAnd my many dreams where of you\nI walked the endless lonely miles\nI stumbled path upon path\nI watched time slip away\nI watched and didn't care\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Lion serpent sun\nPoint the holy wand\nThou sixfold star\nForce and fire\n\n...\n\n"
