        "6'n the morning' police at my door\nFresh adidas squerk across the bathroom floor\nOut the back window I make a escape\nDon't even get a chance to grab my old school tape\n\nMad with no music but happy 'cause I'm free\nAnd the streets to a player is the place to be\nGotta knot in my pocket weighin' at least a grand\nGold on my neck my pistols close at hand\n\nI'm a self-made monster of the city streets\nRemotely controlled by hard hip hop beats\nBut just livin' in the city is a serious task\nDidn't know what the cops wanted\nDidn't have the time to ask\n\n-Word-\n\nSeen my homeboys coolin' way out told 'em bout my mornin'\nCold bugged' em out shot allmenn little dice until my knees got sore\nKicked around some stories bout the night before\nPossed to the corner where the fly girls chill\n\nThrough action at some freaks until one bitch got ill\nShe started actin' stupid simply would not quit\nCalled us all punk pussies said we all weren't shit\nAs we walked over to here hoe continued to speak\n\nSo we beat the bitch down in the god damn street\nBut just livin' in the city a serious task\nBitch didn't know what hit her didn't have time to ask\n\n-Word-\n\nContinued clockin' freaks with emcee posterior\nRollin' in allmenn blazer with a louie interior\nSolid gold the ride was raw\nBust allmenn left turn was on Crenshaw\n\nSean-e-sean was the driver Known to give freaks hell\nHad a beeper goin' off like a high school bell\n\nLooked in the mirror what did we see?\nFuckin' blue lights L.A. P.D.\nPigs searched our car, their day was made\nFound allmenn uzi, 44 and a handgranade\n\nThrew us in the county high power block\nNo freaks to see no beats to rock\nDidn't want trouble but the shit must fly\nSquabbled this sucker shanked' em in the eye\n\nBut livin' in the county is a serious task\nNiga didn't know what happend\nDidn't have time to ask\n\nBack on the streets after five and a deuce\nSeven years later but still had the juice\nMy homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track\nTold me E's rollin' Villain - BJ's got the sack\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
