        "Yesterday, chased two rabbits and they both got away\nTo choose is a chore, my voice is too sore\nTo call them back out from the forest\nOh, maybe I'll catch them one day\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We got one more to go\nAnd the last one was a mistake\nI'd pour you another\nBut it think I heard the bottle brake\nOn your bedroom floor\nWe'll count the hours away\nCause I see no sense in sleeping\nOnly to wake up\nMuch too late\nOh and I mean\nIt's not that I'm scared\nI've got to\nWait for the end to call you\n\nLalita\nDon't you hate these kisses?\n...\n\n", 
        "Night delivers cold shivers\nI've been waiting on a heart that quivers for you, Kathleen\nYu're golden\nYou're just waiting for the stars unfolding for you\n\nSlow winnings, the room's spinning\nFalse starts lead to sad endings\n...\n\n", 
        "Wildflower, 'neath the Autumn leaves\nlead me to the river, bind my hands and feet\nlost for words...\nI just couldn't speak\n\nwill I sink or swim up to the gods to pull me in?\nLike a fish in the sea\ncome to me\nbad retention is\nkilling our sheep\n\nlight through sleeping eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "We caught a spark\nAnd lingered like a feather\nIf every night's a violent fight\nHow can we hold this thing together?\n\nWe're throwing all the money away\nI don't need to pay for our mistake\n\nSunrise to fireflies\nThese white lies have only left me wasted\nAnd now I'm running out of time\n...\n\n", 
        "Chesapeake, I could barely speak\nWhen I said my first goodbye\nMy angel she had frozen feet\nThe day that I arrived\n\nTake your chances hustlin'\nOr work a nine-to-five\nIf we don't get busted\nWe may get out alive\n\nManteo, got me tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "In the red July\nWhen we bit the dust on Providence\nAll tangled in our not-so-common sense\nI heard you say\nYou'd never sleep again\n'Til the bed was made\nYou lied, you lied, you lied, you lied\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Stop that horsin' around\nYour lady's waiting at home\nShe's always had eyes for you\nOh, and you like being alone\n\nYou'll come around one day\nAfter they're all gone\nAnd who is to blame\nWe try, but we ain't the same\n...\n\n",
