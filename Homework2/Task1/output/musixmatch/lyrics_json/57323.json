        "I made a wish on a shooting star once but it's been so long\nNever did believe it till you showed up there and proved me wrong\nEveryone is here and they're all cheering with the end of another day\nIit's friday night, everyone's asleep and now we're walking home\nOur shadows grow underneath the streetlights till they're overgrown\nA perfect end to a perfect night and I feel so alright\nOne, she makes me feel\nNot too much like anything\nThat's three times more than\nI've ever felt before\nOne AM, and I am too sucked in\n'cause it is three days later\nI can't stop thinking about you\nCall up your friends and lets go down to the beach\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
