        "Every day's made of stone\nTonight my wordless dreams slip into song\nCity lights I can see\nBeckon to me\nI'm not wastin' more time\nNo\u2013o\u2013o\nFrom far away they promise me fame\nFollow them right on through\n\nOh I'm on the run\nTonight and every day\nI want everything\n\u2018Cause I want everything\n\nOh I'm on the run\nI'm not afraid to say\nI want everything\n\u2018Cause I want everything\n...\n\n", 
        "I woke up this morning\nHunger was gnawing my soul\nBut the preacher man's sermon\nWon't put no food in my bowl\n\nAbidjan to Monrovia\nLooking for food and a home\nInstead I found factions and armies\nIn the middle of a combat zone\n\nI want love, I need love\nI want love\nI want love, I need love,\nAnd a little food in my bowl\n\nHere in this tribal warfare\nFor food you need money or a gun\nI signed up - whose side I don't care\nAt least now I'm someone\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Everyone's feeling pretty\nIt's hotter than july\nThough the world's full of problems\nThey couldn't touch us even if they tried\nFrom the park I hear rhythms\nMarley's hot on the box\nTonight there will be a party\nOn the corner at the end of the block\n\nDidn't Know You\nWould Be Jammin' Until The Break Of Dawn\nI Bet Nobody Ever Told You That You\nWould Be Jammin' Until The Break Of Dawn\nYou Would Be Jammin' And Jammin' And Jammin' Jam On\n\nThey Want Us To Join Their Fighting\nBut Our Answer Today\nIs To Let All Our Worries\nLike The Breeze Through Our Fingers Slip Away\nPeace Has Come To Zimbabwe\n...\n\n", 
        "Sweet sweet,\nDream so sweetly tonight,\nSweet sweet,\nDream so sweetly tonight,\n\nI first seen you on the market place,\nChopping, peeling sticks of sugar cane,\nI fell in love with your sweet smile,\n\nSlip away from the city race,\nFollow me to a lonely place,\nCome lie down by my waterfall,\n\nSweet sweet,\nCome dreem sweetly tonight,\nSweet sweet,\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm gonna rock you child\nI'm gonna rock you tender\nI'll sing a song of mine\nWill make you feel so tender\nI hold you tight and keep my fears at bay\n\nWhen I was just a child\nMy life was not so tender\nThey wouldn't sing to me\nAnd though I still remember\nHard times that I've been through\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh Lord I made it through\nI'm gonna lay down my load\nOne more mile or two\nCan't escape from my fate, no\n\nLong is the way\nLong is the way\nLong is the way\nLong is the way\n\nAll clad in silk and gold\nI have seen kings and their queens\nWith just one single golden thread\nI could have woven dreams\nI've dug for gold it's true\nAnd those kings granted loans\nBut I'm still empty-handed\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight is free, tonight the streets\nEcho the sounds of the carnival\nRun will flow, crowd will grow\nFilin' the streets as drums start the beat\nWe got rhythm strong\nBurnin' in our thights\nCelebrate all night long 'cause we're alive\n...\n\n", 
        "Mama sat down and spoke today\nWhile there's life\nThere is hope, it's comin' your way\nListen to me\nOh just hear the words I say\n\nMama tells me I'm like those fools\nClammed up tight\nHolding back what they should say\nPressure building up the storm\nIs gonna break some day\n...\n\n",
