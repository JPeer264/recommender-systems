        "Stills Stephen\nStills\nLove Story (Stephen Stills)\n---------------------------\nI'm out on the street\nAll alone by the newsstand\nThe lady of leisure comes\nTearin' by\nAlmost knocking me down\n\nShe turns at the corner\nAnd looking back\nLets her eyes send the message\nI'm helpless alone\nAnd I'm goin' down\n\nHelp me I need someone gentle to love me\nMy life is a miserable comedy\nOf strangers\nPosing as friends\n...\n\n", 
        "Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel\nNever ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel\nLike a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon\nLike a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon\nLike a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face\nAnd the world is like an apple whirling silently in space\nLike the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!\n\nLike a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own\nDown a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone\nLike a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream\nOr the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream\nLike a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face\nAnd the world is like an apple whirling silently in space\n...\n\n", 
        "I left my heart in San Francisco.\nHigh on a hill it calls to me\nto be where little cable cars\nclimb halfway to the stars!\nThe morning fog may chill the air,\nI don't care!\nMy love waits there in San Francisco,\n...\n\n"
