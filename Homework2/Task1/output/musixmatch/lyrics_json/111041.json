        "Strange winds are blowing me\nDown this way\nThere's no prize in sight but the pain in my feet\nBut I won't remember after tonight\nThe clock turns red and the word on the street\nIs that we are getting ready to leave\nBehind me, I've forgotten to check all of the things\nThat somehow now I don't seem to need\n\nStepping over broken doors down in the streets\nAll the chairs and tables lay on their sides\n...\n\n", 
        "Just a talk, it's all you wanted\nTooth and nail is what you fought with\nAll you've got is that photograph that makes me laugh\nThis heart attack is killing me\nCause every time I turn around it's something else\n\n...\n\n", 
        "People always talk about\nThings they don't know much about\nYou take your chances when you toss them all aside\nDon't buy their explanations for\nThe things they caution you around\n...\n\n", 
        "All this time you felt all overgrown\nStuck inside with those little minds\nAll alone\nAnd no one came\nWinter refrain made you sing along\nTo windowpanes\nAnd faster trains\n...\n\n", 
        "You're walking,\nWalking slow.\nBut you gotta move fast,\nIn Tokyo.\n\nYou can't believe your eyes,\nYou finally got here.\nSo many little red lights,\n...\n\n", 
        "Centuries of swallowing all your pride\nOnly leads to shifting eyes\nAll the kids are out tonight\nAs darkness creeps and secrets keep\n...\n\n", 
        "I am looking, lookin' for something\ncan't quite put my mind at ease\n'cause i need to see, see an opening\ntake my arms in and bring\nbring it together, make it warmer\nall for me...\n\nLookin' for the sun in England\nThrow him a lifeline cause he's sinkin'\ncuz everybodys got their enemies\nand everybody needs a fence to lean on\n...\n\n", 
        "the joke is up behind its veil\nit isn't easy to live that well anymore\n\ni cover it up\ni keep it there just long enough\njust long enough\n\nto tell myself the truth\n...\n\n", 
        "Down your old street\nKids are laughing\nLike no one is mean.\nWas that what you thought you'd need\nTo be inspired again?\n\nLike you once were\nLike you once were\nLike you once were\nYou've got to move on today.\n\nIt's just another day.\nMake a break for it.\nTurn to all the clocks on the wall\n...\n\n", 
        "You couldn't wake up\nOn a morning and try\nTo feel so good\nThat you didn't realise\nAnd the things they're like\nthat stop me from crying\nbut at night\nThey stop me from crying\n\nI couldn't take up\nMore space in my mind\nThere's a back door that isn't even to find\nBecause of a call from self-indulgence\nWe don't need our role\nTo prove that we're selfish\n...\n\n", 
        "Strange winds are blowing me\nDown this way\nThere's no prize in sight but the pain in my feet\nBut I won't remember after tonight\nThe clock turns red and the word on the street\nIs that we are getting ready to leave\nBehind me, I've forgotten to check all of the things\nThat somehow now I don't seem to need\n\nStepping over broken doors down in the streets\nAll the chairs and tables lay on their sides\n...\n\n", 
        "I know why you're chasing all the headlights\nBecause you're always trying to get ahead of light\nBaby, when you go\nYou know I'll be waiting on the other side\nAnd I know it's cold\nBut if you stay\nThen I could keep you warm at night\nDon't be a fool for the city nights\n\n...\n\n", 
        "People always talk about\nThings they don't know much about\nYou take your chances when you toss them all aside\nDon't buy their explanations for\nThe things they caution you around\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm hoping that you feel the same as I do\nWalking through the ruins of this crazy town\nLike we've got plans that you don't have\nAnd like there's a place waiting just for us to run to\nJust for us to run to\nIf all is the same wherever we go\nWell I suppose we should change our names\nSettle into something they say will make the world a better place to run to\n...\n\n", 
        "Where do you\nDraw the line\nfor -- that I've caused or you will die\nGoing, going, gone I'm glad that you came along\n...\n\n", 
        "Just a talk, it's all you wanted\nTooth and nail is what you fought with\nAll you've got is that photograph that makes me laugh\nThis heart attack is killing me\nCause every time I turn around it's something else\n\n...\n\n"
