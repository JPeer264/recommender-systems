        "Flow, my tears, fall from your springs!\nExiled for ever, let me mourn;\nWhere night's black bird her sad infamy sings,\nThere let me live forlorn.\nDown vain lights, shine you no more!\nNo nights are dark enough for those\nThat in despair their lost fortunes deplore.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Weep you no more, sad fountains;\nWhat need you flow so fast?\nLook how the snowy mountains\nHeaven's sun doth gently waste.\nBut my sun's heavenly eyes\nView not your weeping,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "What if I never speed,\nshall I straight yield to despair,\nand still on sorrow feed\nthat can no loss repair;\nor shall I change my love,\nfor I find pow'r to depart,\nand in my reason prove\nI can command my heart?\nBut if she will pity my desire,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
