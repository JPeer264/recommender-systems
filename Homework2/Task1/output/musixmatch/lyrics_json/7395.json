        "I like to make this groove sincere\nBass Bumpers in tha house are gonna funk ya real\nFunk ya real\n\nI wanna rock the place\nCan we take it to the max?\n\nThere's a way for you to enjoy yourself\nA place to let it go\nTime to release those feelings\nThere's a place that you should know\n\nJust come and dance along to my rhythm\nJust let your body go\nDance and move your body\nLet the music take your soul\n\n...\n\n"
