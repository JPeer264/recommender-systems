        "Will you jump up here next to me?\nThe moon is close and warm and serene\nAnd it's mine for you.\n\nIn this cave I have found just for us\nForget your fat it's a pillow soft for my neck\nIn this cave on the moon built for you\nJust for you because you're perfect\n...\n\n",

        "Go good and gentle men\nI'm falling asleep again.\n\nTake my sins and take my tablets\nHave these notions culled from oceans (of experience).\n\nHide them well in fear\nI'll abuse them wake up with an unchanged whim.\n\nTake my sins and take my tablets\n...\n\n", 
        "I open my eyes and look at his face again.\nOh good god so nothing's changed.\nThe shopping to eat and the coffee to drink\nThe untrusty work in this miserable clink.\n\nHe reaches for a packet of cigarettes on the table\n...\n\n", 
        "I am the sinner with only socks on.\nThey huddle around me and cross their arms.\nSeeking chaos in injury\nFear of breathing close to me.\n\nHammer it home I want to hammer it in.\nTake the lot on and never give in.\nYou don't know the pain it can cause\nYou don't know how far we had got.\n\n...\n\n",
