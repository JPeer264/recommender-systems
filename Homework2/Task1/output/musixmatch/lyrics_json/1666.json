        "They say into your early life romance came\nAnd in this heart of yours burned a flame\nA flame that flickered one day and died away\nThen, with disillusion deep in your eyes\nYou learned that fools in love soon grow wise\nThe years have changed you, somehow\nI see you now\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Tea For Two\nTony Bennett\n(Irving Caesar/Vincent Youmans)\n\nI'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.\nDarling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.\nFar from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,\nCozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.\n\nPicture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea,\nJust me for you and you for me, alone!\n...\n\n", 
        "\"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n\nYour love belongs to me.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't know why there's no sun up\nIn the sky stormy weather\nSince my gal and I ain't together\nKeeps rainin' all the time\nLife is bare, gloom and misery everywhere\nStormy weather\nOh, I just can't get my poor self together\nKeeps rainin' all the time\nOh, since he went away\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll get by\nAs long as I have you\nThough there be rain\nAnd darkness too\nI'll not complain\n...\n\n", 
        "It had to be you, it had to be you.\nI wandered around and finally found the somebody who\nCould make me be true, could make me feel blue,\nAnd even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.\n\nSome others I've seen might never be mean\nMight never be cross or try to be boss,\nBut they wouldn't do.\nFor nobody else gave me a thrill.\n...\n\n", 
        "I've just found joy\nI'm as happy as a baby boy\nWith another brand new chu chu toy\nWhen I'm with my sweet Lorraine\nA pair of eyes\nThat are bluer than the summer skies\nWhen you see them you will realize\nWhy I love my sweet Lorraine\n...\n\n", 
        "Please forgive this platitude\nBut I like your attitude\nYou are just the kind I've had in mind\nNever could find\n\nHoney, I'm so keen on you\nI could come to lean on you\n...\n\n", 
        "Merry month of may, sunny skies of blue,\nclouds have rolled away and the sun peeps thru,\nMay express happiness, joy you may define in a thousand ways,\nbut a case like mine needs a \"special phrase\"\nto reveal how I feel.\n\nI've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,\nGot the string around my finger,\nWhat a world, what a life, I'm in love!\nI've got a song that I sing,\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've just found joy\nI'm as happy as a baby boy\nWith another brand new chu chu toy\nWhen I'm with my sweet Lorraine\nA pair of eyes\nThat are bluer than the summer skies\nWhen you see them you will realize\nWhy I love my sweet Lorraine\n...\n\n", 
        "I've just found joy\nI'm as happy as a baby boy\nWith another brand new chu chu toy\nWhen I'm with my sweet Lorraine\nA pair of eyes\nThat are bluer than the summer skies\nWhen you see them you will realize\nWhy I love my sweet Lorraine\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll never be the same\nStars have lost their meaning for me\nI'll never be the same\nNothing's what it once use to be\nAnd when the songbirds that sing\nTell me it's spring\nI can't believe their song\nOnce love was king but kings can be wrong\nI'll never be the same\n...\n\n", 
        "Hm\n\nWhat have you done to me\nI can't eat, I cannot sleep\nAnd I'm not the same anymore, no, no\nI don't know what to do? Cause all of me wants all of you\nDo I stand alone at the shore\n\nNow once I could turn away\nFrom everything I feel today\nBut now I wanna walk through your door\n\nBut I've got to know, oh, body and soul\nThat you've got no doubt, inside and out\nWe are whole, ho, body and soul\nDon't leave me out in the cold\nJust love me body and soul\n\n(Body and soul)\n...\n\n", 
        "Chillun', listen here to me\nThis is my philosophy\nTo see me through the day\nTo scare my cares away\n\nAll God's Chillun Got Rhythm\n...\n\n", 
        "When they begin the beguine\nIt brings back the sound of music so tender\nIt brings back a night of tropical splendor\nIt brings back a memory ever green\n\nI'm with you once more under the stars\nAnd down by the shore an orchestra's playing\nAnd even the palms seem to be swaying\nWhen they begin the beguine\n\nTo live it again is past all endeavor\n...\n\n", 
        "I've just found joy\nI'm as happy as a baby boy\nWith another brand new chu chu toy\nWhen I'm with my sweet Lorraine\nA pair of eyes\nThat are bluer than the summer skies\nWhen you see them you will realize\nWhy I love my sweet Lorraine\n...\n\n", 
        "Pack up your troubles and just get happy\nYa better chase all your cares away\nSing Hallelujah, come on get happy\nGet ready for the judgment day\n\nThe sun is shining, come on get happy\nThe Lord is waiting to take your hand\nShout Hallelujah, come on get happy\nWe're going to the Promised Land\n\nWe're heading 'cross the river\nGonna wash our sins in the tide\nIt's all so peaceful\n...\n\n", 
        "Hold that tiger\nHold that tiger\nHold that tiger\nHold that tiger\nHold that tiger\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't you hear my heart whisper thru your window, Emaline?\nIt's a lovely night, Emaline, to meander with me,\nHave you told your friends,\nHave you told your people, Emaline?\n...\n\n", 
        "Like someone that hasn't any country\nLike a stranger visiting from Mars\nI went around alone, just like a rolling stone\nUntil I read a message in the stars\n\nIt must have been moonglow, 'way up in the blue\nIt must have been moonglow that led me straight to you\n...\n\n"
