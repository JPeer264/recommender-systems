        "(feat. Audrey Gallagher)\nI see the pieces\nPeople in places\nBurn up the night\nAnd fade to grey\nWalking on water\nDancing on wire\nHang on the edge\nand don't let them...\nI'm on the outside\nWide open spaces\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake\nCan you help me unravel my latest mistake?\nI don't love him, winter just wasn't my season\n\nYeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes\nLike they have any right at all to criticize\nHypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason\n\nAnd 'cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable\nAnd life's like an hourglass, glued to the table\nNo one can find the rewind button, girl\nSo cradle your head in your hands\n\nAnd breathe, just breathe\nOh breathe, just breathe\n\nIn May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss\nJust a Day, he said down to the flask in his fist\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox\nDo the rudebox, shake your rudebox\nDo the rudebox, shake your rudebox\nDo the rudebox, shake your rudebox\nOkay then back to basics\nGrab your shell toes and your fat laces\nA little hand clap for some funk faces\nAnd make your body move in the following places\nGoes up your back and then down your spine\nAnd when it hits your head\nOkay then back to baseheads\nDance like you just won at the special Olympics\nI got the rudebox of the back of a spaceship\nSo sick I just had to take it\nThe R.U.D.E.B.O.X.\nUp yer jacksy, split yer kicks\nSing a song of Semtex\nPocket full of Durex, body full of Mandrex\nAre we gonna have sex\nWill you wear your knee socks, back to the rudebox\nGot this double fantasy where we just never stop\nI got one design and that's to funk you to the top\nKnow what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find\nI got one design and that's to bump you 'til you drop\nRudebox, do the rudebox, 'cos you so nasty\nRudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty\nRudebox, do the rudebox, 'cos you so nasty\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
