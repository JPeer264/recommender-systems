        "I smoked one\nTook a walk in the wake of the sun\nTook a look at the sky through my weary heart\nAnd baggy eyes\n\nYou spoke some\nI could not decipher the tongue\nSome talk of what's good 'bout the sun\nThat's all I understood.\n\nMy mind is an altar\n...\n\n", 
        "Just above your breast\nLike a beacon on your sternum\nThe symbol of the taurus\nMarks where my head will rest\nLittle beams of light\nMake their home upon your body\nMy fingertips discover every one of them\nTonight\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I do desire to live my life\nAnd not let sorrow in\nI've got a lady young and wise\nAnd beautiful to see\nHer love makes me want to be\nBoth sure and keen\nTo light my treasures\nDown at the foot of my queen\nI will live for my queen\nI will live for my queen\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight my dreams keep me stirring\nAlone in bed I'm tossing and turning\nAnd in my head my thoughts are whirring\nWith such unrest what peace can come?\n\nI need my lover's warmth to calm me\nIt would ease me just to hear her talking\n...\n\n", 
        "Run the wire from bow to stern\nGive the windlass a couple turns\nCheck the running light tonight, good light above\nAnd tomorrow we shall see\nIf she is worthy of the sea\nAnd then see if she is worthy of thy love\n\nMay you down on featherbed\nA feather pillow rest your head\nI'm coming home from work, I'm by the water\nI will meet you between the sheets\n...\n\n", 
        "This test I've been used only has one way\nIt is your choice to choose\nI can't tell you\nwhat is right.\nLet's have a few more drinks\nUntil we think that we're alright\nI'll fill up in the morning and I'll kill you\nI will not be there when you turn your heavy head\nAnd we will be nowhere\n...\n\n", 
        "I enjoy your sense of sadness\nSo I endure your happy thoughts\nI disguise disease as madness\nYou could see the scars\nIn the blackness of my heart\n\nSome boys bide their time distilling\nCarboys full of homemade wine\nWhile the ladies drink their fill in\nAnd stumble down the hall\nCausing other birds to brawl\n\nA man ain't worth his matter\nIf he don't work for a dime\n...\n\n", 
        "will I never again lie naked on the rocks that have been heated\nby the sun beside the ocean on my skin soft and cold\n\nwill I stay inside and hide myself from thoughts of the warm granite shoreline\nas I paint all my flesh ghostly white and become as the four walls around me\n\nwhat runs through my veins is an ice flow of blood\nthat's blocking my brain from what's needed\nto return to the sane of the need of the sun\nto melt all this ice into liquid\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I smoked one\nTook a walk in the wake of the sun\nTook a look at the sky through my weary heart\nAnd baggy eyes\n\nYou spoke some\nI could not decipher the tongue\nSome talk of what's good 'bout the sun\nThat's all I understood.\n\nMy mind is an altar\n...\n\n",

        "My daddy's a preacher\nAnd my mom a believer\nThey pray for my soul\nEvery night\n\nBut now I'm feeling closer\nTo my god than I've ever\nSince I fell away from my life\n\nI'm too young to harbor\nAll the secrets of Heaven\nAnd I don't think that I ever will\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got my bearings set on you\nbut my course is all askew\nSo if I am lost at sea\nwould you come and rescue me?\nI know there are other fish out there\nbut you are not a fish\nI'd be clear- you are a lioness\nSo I ride these waves full ahead\nbut I'd rather be back home in bed\n...\n\n", 
        "Will my names grown dim?\nWill my ship come in?\nWhat kind of rich man would be I?\nFor today I am a coward\nI have fear for what's to come\nI've not got the guts to even try.\n...\n\n", 
        "From on my roof I saw her bathing\nHer beauty's more than I can bear\nShe sparks inside of me some craving\nTo bathe me in her flowing hair\n\nAround my house did I inquire\nWho is this beauty, my good friend?\nThey said the one that you desire\nIs wed to one of your best men.\n\nAs he was out at battle for me\n...\n\n", 
        "I was born in Colfax, Indiana.\nJust a farm boy in the Great Depression\nUntil I headed off to war.\nAnd if not for the death of my dear appendix,\nThe love in my heart might have never been born.\n\nSick leave and living all laid up in bed,\nYou were the nurse of the dreams in my head.\nI kept you laughing,\nYou kept me fed,\nAnd we had no notion of what lay ahead.\n\nI drew a picture that you'd grow to love.\n...\n\n", 
        "Gas gauge is in the orange,\nAnd my mouth is dry.\nThese clothes are torn.\nSo softly, place all your fingers\nOn the brokedown palace\nOf my head\n\nEach contusion is a battle\n...\n\n", 
        "Lord knows I love you\nand I miss your fine face\nIt's just not the same when you're gone\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She's as sweet as the honey in the tummy of a big old grizzly bear\nHe had the grizzly mean temper of the tummy of a honey-less bear\nThough she's a delicate flower, she had the power to make a man of the beast\n\nMama made a man out of Daddy\nDaddy made a man out of me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Yes, Yes, I knew that you were evil\nWhen I asked you for your hand\n\nAnd it's not that I have fallen out of love\n...\n\n", 
        "On the river that runs through me\nThere's a boat headed out to sea\nAnd the helmsman's losing steam\nMore each day\n\nAnd the engineer just sleeps\nAs the coal burns more violently\nLord help me, I can't sweep the ash away\n...\n\n"
