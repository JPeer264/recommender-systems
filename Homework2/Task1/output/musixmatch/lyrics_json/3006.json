        "I have seen Him there\nMaster of Light, Master of the night\nMaster of all the things that shine\n\nChorus:\nOh I believe...\nI believe in all that I have seen\nAnd I have seen the Angel Of Light\nI have seen the Angel Of Light... Lucifer\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Just like a demon's eye\nThe moon was dancing on the blackened sky\nIn my sleep nothing is real, dreaming... I'm dreaming\n\nI can feel the shadows lurking\nI can feel them closing in\nI can hear their evil chanting\nThis is not a dream for a king\n\nChorus:\nDancing the Witche's Dance... Dancing the Dance\nDancing the Witche's Dance... Dancing the Dance\n\nCold hands, leading the way\nThrough the woods and into the night\nOutside nothing is real, dreaming... I'm dreaming\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Pre>\nPart one: the vision\n\nThe son of a shepherd, abdul alhazred\nTravelling in the mountains, the mountains to the east\nOne night before him, there stood that giant rock\n3 symbols carved in blood\n\nHe built a fire at it's root\nTo protect him from the wolves...\n\nThe mad arab... he would understand\nThe mad arab... it was in his hands...\n\nLater that same night, awoken by wolfen's cry\nThe arab cold with fear, saw the rock began to rise... rise\n\n...\n\n", 
        "This house is full of hate, this house is full of madness\nThis house is deep insane, this house was never mine\n\n[Chorus:]\nDeep in the dark you will find us\nDEMON and I we are both deep inside\nYes My DEMON and I we are mine\n\nAll of the deadle kisses, all of the sick, sick, sickness\nAll of the broken mirrors, it's here to stay forever\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Minutes and seconds are passing us by\nMinutes and seconds are passing us by\nTime... Time\nMinutes and seconds are passing us by\nTime... Time\n\nTime... Time... Time is always passing by\nDoesn't matter where you are\nTime is passing us by\nWhat a beautiful moment\nIf you're willing to trade\nThen I'll give you a moment of mine\nGive you a moment of mine\n\nMinutes and seconds are passing us by\n...\n\n", 
        "You believe in Heaven\nYou believe the Devil is here\nWhen you ring your demon bell\nYou think I'll en up in Hell\n\n[Chorus:]\nOh yeah you're the Preacher\nYou're the Devil\nYou're the Preacher\nHiding in the Underworld, that's you\n\nI can't wait to see your final show\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna miss you so\n...\n\n", 
        "On a magical misty morning\nI was standing in the Autumn rain\nSuddenly the birds fell silent\nWould I ever hear them sing again...\nHear them sing again...\n\nWithout a word of warning\nI saw a shadow in the Autumn rain\nJust like in my nightly dreams\nThe Lady In Black had come again...\nThe Lady had come again...\n...\n\n", 
        "Solo: S\n\nThe girl in the mirror, she's not really there\nOnly I can see her, in all her misery\n\nChorus:\nThe girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell\nThe girl in the mirror, between Heaven and Hell\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Solo: D\n\nWhy am I here, in a quiet mortuary\nA lady and man, flowers in their hands\nNobody sees me, I don't understand\nNobody hears me...\nSeems like I don't exist\nSeems like no one can hear me as I... Scream\n\nI do not feel the way I used to be\nCould it really be that the one I see is me\nYou gotta tell why people come but never stay\n...\n\n", 
        "Dark lady coming out at night\nStill glory\nLet's those legs on fire\nShe's going to take away your life\nAnd there's a mess beyond the killing fields\nA shock\nBells ringing from the city tower\nIt's a woman\nPeople running\nGirl haunted\n...\n\n", 
        "I was born on the cemetery\nUnder the sign of the moon\nRaised from my grave by the dead\nI was made a mercenary\nIn the legions of Hell\nNow I'm king of pain, I'm insane\n\nYou know my only pleasure\n...\n\n", 
        "Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings\nWhere the mummified pharaohs\nPretend dead in their sleep\n\nDon't touch, never ever steal\nUnless you're in for the kill\nOr you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs\nYes you'll be hit and the curse is on you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "They're walking by the night\nThe moon has frozen blue\nLong black coats a shelter for the rain\nTheir load must get through\n\nNow bats are leaving their trees\nThey're joining the call\nSeven satanic Hell preachers\nHeading for the hall\n\nBringing the blood of a newborn child\nGot to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall\n\nHome... Come home\nEvil messengers with blood stained wings\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "Listen, I? m a corpse, I? m a corpse\nI? m a corpse without soul\nSatan, he? s taken, he? s taken\nHe taken his toll\n\nListen, I? m a corpse, I? m a corpse\nI? m a corpse without soul\nSatan, he? s taken, he? s taken\nHe? s taken his toll\n\nI was walking down among the graves\nI heard a cry, my shadow is gone\nEmptiness in my body, life in the cold\nSmall black wings on my naked back\n...\n\n"
