        "Peeling your flesh away sever it from you bones\nSeparating your head from your body then revel in your blood\nMaiming your mangled corpse Tearing your skin apart\nIncinerate your remains while ripping out your heart\nFlesh - cadaver - blood\nSevering flesh\nSevering flesh\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I want to die a brutal way\nInstead of just fade away\n\nShredded flesh mutilated\nSevered head decapitated\n\nRipped and torn piece by piece\nRape my corpse then leave me in peace\n...\n\n", 
        "Living in a constant dream of a place you've never seen\nPreaching all those feeble lies of a life in paradise\nYour faith is just insanity too scared to face reality\nStupid enough to believe all this christinsanity\n\nYou make me sick\nFeeble son\n...\n\n",

        "", 
        "Sadistic, killing of your mind\nPathetic, mutants in your brain\n\nDamage, is already done\nFailure, of the sacrifice\nConfronting with your maker, \nparanoid vision a dream \nFlesh is dripping cold\nDay of mourning\n\nDeath is on your back\nWatching, the angels die.\n...\n\n", 
        "Walk the last steps of the face of the earth\nDismembered bodies, fallen victims of decay\nFallen from above, prophecy of death\nAgonizing torment to wipe out the inhuman\n\nShattered shreds of life, tearing my inner side\nRise from the turf, as my guts regurge\nProcession to the wise, gasping to survive\nMutilated stiffs, desecrating tombs.\n\nGod of all life and humanity\n...\n\n"
