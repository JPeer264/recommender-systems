        "Leave your door open,\nThe night is only young\nI wanna get under your body\n\nBut why do we only give it up?\nGive it up in the dark\nCause I cant help thinking\nIts not enough,\nIts not enough for this heart\nWho do you think about when Im not with you?\nDoes somebody hold you when you let me go?\nYou cant hide, you cant lie\nCause baby Im loving, loving, loving you\nI could tell myself that I dont need you\nI could try to run away from the truth\nI cant hide, I cant lie\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Its complicated, it always is\nJust the way it goes\nFeels like the way it is so long for this\nI wonder if it shows\nAnd under water now i can breath\nIt never felt so good\nI can feel it coming over me\nI wouldn t stop it if i could\n\nWhen love takes over yeah\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Oh, her eyes, her eyes\nMake the stars look like they're not shining\nHer hair, her hair\nFalls perfectly without her trying\nShe's so beautiful\nAnd I tell her every day\n\nYeah, I know, I know\nWhen I compliment her she won't believe me\nAnd it's so, it's so\nSad to think that she don't see what I see\nBut every time she asks me, \"Do I look okay?\"\nI say...\n\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\n'Cause you're amazing just the way you are\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
