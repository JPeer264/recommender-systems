        "It's always such a drag\nIt's always such a shame\nGo on and have a laugh\n'Cause it's always the same\nAnd it's always the same\nAnd even the days are waking up\nI'm still asleep\n\nI just wanna\nI just wanna have some fun\n...\n\n", 
        "Such little relevance in the perfumes of high culture\nValidate her innocence like a Pacific summer\nTo an east coast kid living out the same lies that his parents did\nNow comes a (?) fury view the sequence to your mother\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The devil sitting on my shoulder\nHe told me not to play the game\nI thought that it could be some good advice\nIt's a terrible shame\n\nMy mom said it's a bad world\nShe told me of the sad girls\nSo what's the point in trying if it always ends the same?\n\nLove is in the air, but I don't care\n'Cause I don't want to love anymore\nAnd if I hear the word again\nI think I'll drill a hole in my head\n\nHe's got a real bad attitude\nIt's all a waste of time\nAnd it's a deja vu\n...\n\n",

        "Oh my God, is it morning?\nIs there something I've been ignoring?\nOh my God, is it too late?\nIs there something I need to say?\n\nI know\nI know\nAnd it never was found\nAnd it never came around\n\nIt felt just fine, but it never was mine\n...\n\n"
