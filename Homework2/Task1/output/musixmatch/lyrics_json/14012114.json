        "You were my sun\nYou were my earth\nBut you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no\nSo you took a chance\nAnd made other plans\nBut I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no\n\nYou don't have to say, what you did,\nI already know, I found out from him\nNow there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be\nAnd don't it make you sad about it\n\nYou told me you loved me\nWhy did you leave me, all alone\nNow you tell me you need me\nWhen you call me, on the phone\nGirl I refuse, you must have me confused\nWith some other guy\nYour bridges were burned, and now it's your turn\nTo cry, cry me a river\nCry me a river\nCry me a river\nCry me a river\n\nI know that they say\nThat somethings are better left unsaid\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213978)",
