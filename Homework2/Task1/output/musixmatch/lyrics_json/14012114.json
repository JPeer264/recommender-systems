        "Mia, I've come apart and you made me\nFloat like a pretty box of your evil\nSo tired, so easy I\n\nBleed out, what the fuck were you thinking?\nWe are gonna fall if you lead us\nNowhere, no wasted time\n\nI'll be a thorn in your side, till you die\nI'll be a thorn in your side, for always\nIf we sink, we lift our love\nI'll be a thorn in your side, till you die\nI'll be a thorn in your side, for always\nIf we sink, we lift our love\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Faster, faster, you won't go far\nShouldn't leave, feeling faint, we both know why\nYou've got to show me, both knees, cold I lie\nHold me slowly, hide me till I can fly\n\nAlways we can sing, we can make time\nOld songs, flood and flame, you could be mine\nBut you've got to show me, both knees, skin and bone\nClothe me, throw me, move me till\n\nI can sell you lies, you can't get enough\nMake a true believer of\nAnyone, anyone, anyone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Carved out, cold\nHiding from you in this skin, so old\nI'll come clean\nEverywhere everyone knows it's me\n\nAnd if I recover\nWill you be my comfort\nOr it can be over\nOr we can just leave it here\nSo pick any number\nChoose any color\nI've got the answer\nOpen the envelope\n\nI'll give you one more chance\nTo say we can change or part ways\nAnd you take what you need\nAnd you don't need me\n\nI'll give you one more chance\nTo say we can change our old ways\nAnd you take what you need\nAnd you know you don't need me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "Never took your side, never crossed your name\nI keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-oh\nYou've come as far As you're ever gonna get\nUntil you realize, that you should go-o-oh\nI\u2019m in misery where you can seem as old as your omens\nAnd the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling\nThe way is long but you can make it easy on me\nAnd the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
