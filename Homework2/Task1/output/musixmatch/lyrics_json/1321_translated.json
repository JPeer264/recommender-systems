        "Shattered dreams\nWorthless years\nHere am I encased\nInside a hollow shell\nLife began then was done\nNow I stare into\nA cold and empty well\nThe many sounds that meet our ears\nThe sights our eyes behold\nWill open up our melting hearts\nAnd feed our empty souls\n\nI believe\nWhen I fall in love with you\nIt will be forever\nI believe\nWhen I fall in love this time\nIt will be forever\n\nWithout despair\nWe will share\nAnd the joys of caring\nWill not be replaced\nWhat has been must never end\nAnd with the strength\nWe have wont be erased\n...\n\n", 
        "All is fair in love\nLove's a crazy game\nTwo people vow to stay\nIn love as one, they say\n\nBut all is changed with time\nThe future none can see\nThe road you leave behind\nAhead lies mystery\n\nBut all is fair in love\nI had to go away\n...\n\n", 
        "If you're foolin', only foolin'\nAll I ask is \"Why?\"\nIf you're playin', all I'm sayin'\nIs feelings sure collide\nIf you're lyin', keep on lyin'\nDon't tell the truth, don't you dare\nYou can't drop me, 'cause you still got me\nAfter takin' me way up there\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nIf I ever lose this heaven\nIf I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven\nWhoa, I'll never be the same\n...\n\n", 
        "Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind\nI had no problems, never a problem in my life\nNever a worry on my mind\n\nAll my days before today were happy\nAnd secure until your phone call\nYou were tellin' me goodbye\n\nNow I'm lookin' for another love\nI'm lookin' for another pure love in my life\n...\n\n", 
        "Hang on to the world\nAs it spins around\nJust don't let the spin\nGet you down\nThink of moving fast\nHold on tight and you will last\nGive your self respect\nYour manly pride\nGet yourself in gear\nKeep your stride\nNever mind your fears\n...\n\n", 
        "We wandered through the summertime\nAnd drifted into fall\nWe never thought of winter at all\nHow foolishly we tossed away\nThe buttercups, the time -\n...\n\n", 
        "Tall and tan and young and lovely\nThe girl from Ipanema goes walking\nAnd when she passes each one she passes goes ahh\n\nWhen she walks it's like a samba\nThat swings so cool and sways so gently\nThat when she passes each one she passes goes ahh\n...\n\n", 
        "Why are my eyes always\nFull of this vision of you\nWhy do I dream silly dreams\nThat I fear won't come true\nI long to show you the stars\nCaught in the dark of the sea\n...\n\n", 
        "Gotta good reason\nWere taking the easy way out\nGotta good reason\nWere taking the easy way out\n\nShe was a daytripper, one way ticket, yeah\nTook me so long to find out, I found out\n\nTried to please her\nShe only played when I can\nTried to please her\nShe only played when I can\n...\n\n", 
        "Chove chuva\nConstant is the rain\nChove chuva\nEndless is the pain\nChove chove chove chuva\nEndless is the pain\n\nAs I stand here and remember\nWhen once our hearts were one\nAnd everyday was spring to me\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey, there's a hum in the air\nHey, every star's in a spin\nHey, something's saying out there\nHey, something's gonna begin\nFor me\n\nNever at no time was there a night like this\nNever at no time was every star so clear\nNever at no time has my heart beat so fast\n...\n\n", 
        "Night and day\nYou are the one\nOnly you beneath the moon\nAnd under the sun\nWhether near to me or far\nIt's no matter, darling,\nWhere you are\nI think of you\nNight and day\n\nDay and night\nWhy is it so\nThat this longing for you\nFollows wherever I go\nIn the roarin' traffic's boom\nIn the silence of my lonely room\nI think of you\nDay and night\n...\n\n", 
        "What would you think if I sang out a tune\nWould you stand up and walk out on me\nLend me your ears and I'll sing you a song\nAnd I'll try not to sing out of key\n\nI get by with a little help from my friends\nI get high with a little help from my friends\nyeah, gonna try with a little help from my friends\n\nWhat do I do when my love is away\nDoes it worry you to be alone\nBut how do I feel by the end of the day\nAre you sad because you're on your own\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's Q-Tip, the ass-jack\nWill.i.am and Sergio\nQ-tip steady rockin' on yo' radio\nIt's the eh, it's the ethnic\nIt's the hip hop dance, let's sing\n\nCorocodo, corocodocodo\nCerecedeng, cerecedegedeng\nCisaingeng, cisaingengeng\nCirikidzing, cirikidzkidzing\n\nCorocodo, corocodocodo\nCerecedeng, cerecedegedeng\nCisaingeng, cisaingengeng\nCirikidzing, cirikidzkidzing\n\nCorocodo, corocodocodo\nCerecedeng, cerecedegedeng\nCisaingeng, cisaidengeng\nCirikidzing\n\nIt's Q-tip\n\nDon't have lotta time, man, I really gotta move man\nShe's waitin' for me now, man, don't wanna blow the move, man\n? Cause you know I gotta go to her place\nI go to another space when I look at her face\n\nAnd look at her eyes they're deep like pools of water\nI'm really turned on now and I know that I oughta\nHold her hand, let my love pour dance on the dance floor\nIf you can't dance, baby, I can show you\nJus' clap yo' hand and let the music take you\n\nAnd put your foots in, and let it all shake ya\nAnd take yo' head and put you hands up, ah\nAnd shake your waist, ah, and you can tip it up\nJust move your hands, eh, and move your waist, eh\n\n...\n\n"
