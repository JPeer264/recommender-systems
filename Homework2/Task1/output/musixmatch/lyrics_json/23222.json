        "I wonder what we'll play for you tonight.\nSomething heavy or something light.\nSomething to set your soul alight.\nI wonder how we'll answer when you say.\n\"We don't like you - go away\"\n\"Come back when you've learned to play\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Quickstep (written 4/77)\nI knew my youth couldn't last forever\nI knew some chords so I got the band together\nSick of sleeping and beating up my mother\nForget these luxuries, I've got myself another buzz\nNow you don't see me, now you do\nPretty s\noon you're going to see what punks can do\nI stole some tunes from the radio\nI lost my nerve but it didn't show\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm lying in a hospital,\nI'm pinned against the bed.\nA stethoscope upon my heart,\nA hand against my head.\nThey're peeling off the bandages.\nI'm wincing in the light.\nThe nurse is looking anxious,\nAnd she's quivering in fright\n\nI'm looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes.\n\nThe doctors are avoiding me.\n...\n\n", 
        "We're talking into corners\nFinding ways to fill the vacuum\nAnd though our mouths are dry\nWe talk in hope to hit on something new\nTied to the railway tracks\nIt's one way to revive but no way to relax\n\nWe're just bored teenagers\n...\n\n", 
        "What are you going to do with your new ways?\nWhat are you going to do with your new wave?\nMaybe it's that you no longer care.\nNow you're so great.\nYou've just got to stand there.\nOr were you never even bothered anyway,\nAbout the new wave.\n\nWhat about the new wave?\nDid you think it would change things?\n\nHere we all are in the latest craze.\nStick with the crowd,\n...\n\n", 
        "Who wait in the cafe and magazine.\nWho wait for morning or fag machine.\nWho leave it all unfinalised,\nAnd undecided...\nWe who wait.\n\nWho wait in the bus queue and prison cell.\nWho wait for illness to take its toll.\nWho wait for God knows what.\n...\n\n", 
        "Life's short, don't make a mess of it.\nTo the ends of the earth, you'll look for a sense in it.\nNo chances, no plans.\nI'll smash the windows of my box.\nI'll be a madman.\nIt's no time to be 21,\nTo be anyone.\n\nHold back, see what you miss of it.\n...\n\n", 
        "We say don't show your guns, if you don't intend to fight\nWe say don't sleep all day, if you can't keep awake at night\nDon't screw it up. Don't be a hero.\n'Cause we don't need them.\nBe a panther or a poet.\nSomeone to light the beacon.\n\nAnd I wonder, is a new day dawning?\nAnd I wonder, is it around the corner?\nI wonder, are the fighting men still fighting men?\nDo they go on and on and on?\n\n...\n\n"
