        "It's now that we're writing the future\nIt's now that you'll stand up and pray for blessings\nThis life is a game, just enter your name\nHold me tight and chase your dream\nAnd I will let this game begin\n\nIt's in my throat, these words will not be forgotten\nIt's in your eyes, the time has come to roll the dice\nBut time is short, step forward to press the button\nIf you wanna run for your life\n\nYou're drowning deep, you're feeling rough\nBut now you know you're strong enough\nYou have survived the final scene\nAnd you can let the game begin\nJust let the game begin\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
