        "I'm sick of the excuses that you want me to believe\nI've been understanding\nGiving everything you need\nUsing me is over now and soon you're gonna see\nI'm done with you\n\nWould there be a difference if I followed what you say\nTaken from my mind and I can't seem to get away\nUsing me is over now and soon you're gonna see\nI'm done with you\n\nEveryone is the same\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Will you walk me to the edge again\nShaking\nLonely\nAnd I am drinking again\nWoke up tonight and no one's here with me\nI'm giving in to you\n\nTake me under\nI'm giving in to you\nI'm dying tonight\nI'm giving in to you\nWatch me crumble\nI'm giving in to you\nI'm crying tonight\nI'm giving in to you\n\nCaught up in life\nLosing all my friends\nFamily has tried to heal all my addictions\nTragic it seems to be alone again\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "I wanted to know who you really are\nI needed the chance to stitch up my scars\nI'm closer to you than I was in the start\nCome dive right in and tear me apart\n\nI'm trapped and we can't get along\nI thought that I was strong, we are so unstable\nIn bed, I'm strung out from your touch\nBut I won't give you up, we are so unstable\n\nI wanted to learn about the dark side of you\nYou bring me down like a bottle of pills\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Most people don't care\nSome people just stare\nThere's so much pressure that my life will feed us\nDon't need a reason\nI will get even\nThis is the season where I feel so manic\n\nYou hurt yourself and blame me when you fall\nCo-Dependent\nYou have lost control and crashed into a wall\nCo-Dependent\nYou're co-Dependent\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "The weight of the world has been put on my shoulders\nI looked in the mirror and know that I'm older\nI try to escape but the rain makes it colder\nWhy do I let all our problems take over?\nThere's nothing I can do\nThere's nothing I can say\nWe need to try to find a right way\nStress me out, stress me out\nGod has turned his back on me\nStress me out, stress me out\nThere's nothing there for us to say\nStress me out, stress me out\nGod has turned his back\nStress me out, stress me out\nThere's nothing there to bleed\nTo blame\nI try to explain what it's doing to me\nArguing over the simplest things\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
