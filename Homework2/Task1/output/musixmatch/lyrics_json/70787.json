        "Nobody ever had a dream round here\nBut I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me\nNobody ever pulls the seams round here\nBut I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me\n\nI've got this energy beneath my feet\nLike something underground's gonna come up and carry me\nI've got this sentimental heart that beats\nBut I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me now\n\nWhy do you waste my time?\nIs the answer to the question on your mind\nAnd I'm sick of all my judges\nSo scared of what they'll find\nBut I know that I can make it\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
