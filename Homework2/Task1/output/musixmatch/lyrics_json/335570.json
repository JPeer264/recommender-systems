        "Do you remember? The very first day\nWhen I walked inside the room\nFeeling so afraid and you came and smile\nDo you remember? Just sittin' on the bench\nLooking at horizon with just headphones on our heads\nJust go with the flow\nThought they say this road is getting narrow\nAnd there's one thing that I want you to know\n\nLet's go and meet the sunrise, there is no need for goodbye\nWe got a dream to follow, so don't you dare let go\nNo matter how big the ocean and how strong the storms we'll meet then\nWe'll sail until we reach the shore to the bright tomorrow\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
