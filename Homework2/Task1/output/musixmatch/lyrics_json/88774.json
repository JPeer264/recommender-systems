        "I breathed through your body's vivid light\nInside while I lost my will\nMy name, cancelled itself in the\nUniversal space of our experiences.\nIn matter and anti-matter\nOur hopes have been flaked\n\nI will be a docile worm that will twist\n'Round God's mercy and your affected charity.\nFrom here on your divine son will mix with me\nAnd strewn with the golden saliva\nWe will taste the death\nAnd in the death the conquest of the will.\nWe dragged our weaknesses in religion\nIn the useless speculation of existence\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I tried to possess your body\nand hid me in the suffocating dephts of your flesh\nI was your absent idol while you fed me with the poison of your wounds\nthe sewer of your sex crushes the stupid arrogance of my autorithy\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I'd like not to know that instict\nWhich is guiding you...\nAm I guilty as you are?\n\nIt's the same guilt that beats you on the back\nThat crushes on your kidneys...\nI condemn you but I'm just a worm.\n\nI love your lack of conscience\nAnd the freedom of your violence.\n\nWhat exactly shakes my heart\nAnd what fills up the greed of my lust?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "May this be the last night in this south,\nThe last night with the wine and immortal fascination\nThe world ignore the cruel delight of our vice\nAnd the useless common god who delivered us to wait\n\nWhat\u2019 s the meaning of talking \u2018bout protection now?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
