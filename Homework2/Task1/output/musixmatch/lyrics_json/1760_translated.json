        "It was just another suitcase,\nanother one night stand.\nAnother sea of faces\nstaring from the dark. (dark)\nThen I saw you looking up at me\nwith unmistakeable eyes.\nI could see you were determined\nto make a mark.\nYou were coming for me\njust like a mako shark.\n\nAnd I was paralysed.\nParalysed by the fire in your eyes.\nI was paralysed,\njust couldn't move.\n\nStraight as an arrow\nI see you flyin' through the night.\nA message with a number\n...\n\n", 
        "Darlin', I'd do anything for you.\nAnything you want me to,\nbecause I love you.\nBaby, you are everything to me.\nThe only one I'll ever need,\nbecause I love you.\n\nIt's so hard to find a love like yours,\nso don't you ever leave me, darlin'.\nIf you ever turn to walk away,\nthen I just have to say.\n\nIt takes a woman like you,\nit takes a woman like you,\nit takes a woman like you,\n...\n\n",

        "Standing alone with no place to call home,\nyou look for a friend,\nthere ain't one in the end you can turn to.\nSomehow you learn to\nfight like a storm from the day that you're born.\nYou duck and you dive,\nbut it's all for nothing.\nNothing's for nothing.\nMust realize it is just a disguise\nthat they wear, nobody cares.\n\nIt's you, you've gotta believe.\nThere's no one in there to deceive.\nTurn your back to the wall,\nwalk tall, you've gotta believe.\nThere's no one in there to deceive but you.\n\nLife is a journey, a road without end,\nembedded with hearts that are broken and wasted,\n...\n\n", 
        "You may be a king,\nor just a common man.\nSome high fashioned model\nwith a Hollywood tan.\nIt just don't matter\nwho you think you are.\nYou'll be a slave to love tonight.\n\nYou may have a dream,\nor second sight.\nYesterday's hero,\nor a star over night.\nWalkin' on the water,\n...\n\n", 
        "Rainy days, closed cafes,\ndrifting, haunting.\nHollow eyes, numb inside,\nlonely and empty.\nI'm searching for laughter,\nfor memories brought alive.\nPlaces and faces and traces of you.\n\nDarkened skies, spot lit lies,\naching, awaking.\nWords return, why can't we learn?\nLove is forgiving and taking\nand living in honesty.\n...\n\n",

        "The dance of the puppets\nThe rusted chains of prison moons\nAre shattered by the sun\nI walk a road, horizons change\nThe tournament's begun\n\nThe purple piper plays his tune\nThe choir softly sing\nThree lullabies in an ancient tongue\nFor the court of the Crimson King\n\nThe keeper of the city keys\nPut shutters on the dreams\n...\n\n", 
        "Lady Supermarket with an apple in her basket\nKnocks on the manager's door;\nGrooning to the muzak from a speaker in shoe rack\nLays out her goods on the floor;\nEverything she's chosen is conveniently frozen.\n\"Eat it and come back for more!\"\n\nLady Window Shopper with a new one in the hopper\n...\n\n", 
        "There might have been things I missed\nBut don't be unkind\nIt don't mean I'm blind\nPerhaps there's a thing or two\n\nI think of lying in bed\nI shouldn't have said\nBut there it is\n...\n\n", 
        "Just take a pebble and cast it to the sea,\nThen watch the ripples that unfold into me\nMy face spills so gently into your eyes\nDisturbing the waters of our lives\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Still I wonder how it is to be a stream,\nFrom a dark well constant flowing,\nWinding seawards over ancient mossy wheels\nYet feel no need of knowing?\nStill I wonder how it is to be a tree,\nCircled servant to the seasons,\nOnly drink on sky and rake the winter wind\nAnd need no seal of reasons?\n\nStill I wonder why I wonder why I'm here\nAll my words just the shaft of my flail\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you wanna be an angel\nDo you wanna be a star\nDo you wanna play some magic on my guitar\nDo you wanna be a poet\nDo you wanna be my string\nYou could be anything\n\nDo you wanna be the lover of another\nUndercover you could even be the man on the moon\n\nDo you wanna be the player\nDo you wanna be the string\nLet me tell you something\nIt just don't mean a thing\n\n...\n\n",
