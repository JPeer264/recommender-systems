        "Your god sent war into my world.\nBut I will fight to clean my mind.\nNo looking back for me,\nYou crossed the line,\nAll my feelings turn to hate.\nA power you won`t stand,\n...\n\n", 
        "See the mighty sky turns into black\nThe horizon keeps burning\nStench of decay carried by the winds\nIt melts in my mind to see the agony\n\nThey're drowned in an ocean of lies\nThey're burnt in the fire of temptation\nHelplessness and failure\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a war!\nBattlefields of honour deep inside my mind\nFighting for my freedom\nMy idols, my ideas, betrayed by your weakness\nThe stream you're swimming in\nAggression, born from pain\nDisappointed by your aims\nKnowing the solution's beyond your faculties\n\nProjection of your anger on others\nThe way you've chosen to square your conscience\nTo clean it from all guilt\n\nFrom the top of the tower\nI see the dirty lies\nThe path to my position\n...\n\n", 
        "To erase three generations.\nTo slaugther millions of dreams.\nA monument of suffering.\nBuild from human flesh.\nA world taken away from ever.\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't know when it came.\nThis cold, it fills my soul.\nI still feel a fire, but I dosn't.\nWarm anymore.\nWhere is all energy, we once got from love?\n...\n\n", 
        "No single fate, a broken generation.\nOnce guided by hope, now fallen into despair.\nThe chosen few play their game.\nA man, his hands want to grasp, but they don't need him anymore.\nHis eyes without light, his walk weak and still.\n...\n\n", 
        "Symbols of addiction - It won't hit your life just over night.\nIt creeps and wait inside you - Longing for weak moments.\n...\n\n", 
        "Now I know you knew it all before.\nIt was doomed to failure - All my love and all my dreams.\nMy empty eyes embrace the sky.\nImpossible to penetrate your clouds.\n...\n\n", 
        "One moment further.\nA connection diminished.\nAn increasing power.\nAnd become a stranger.\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell me what is left from life, if no sunrise lights your world?\nCan't believe you've been through all this pain,\nAll this pain I know your eyes saw the same sky as I see today,\nYou smelled the leaves, you felt the wind.\nI know they imprisoned your body, but how could they subdue your thoughts?\nI know about the drowned and the saved.\n...\n\n", 
        "Out of my hands.\nThe world lies in debris.\nI carry the load.\nBut I am alone.\nWhere is the ligth.\nThat once filled my world.\nWhere is the fire.\nThat once warmed my soul, all turn away.\n...\n\n", 
        "A suffering race, what will remain.\nMy world comes down.\nI'm not divine anymore.\nAll power leaves - My blood is gray.\n...\n\n", 
        "Mortified by the lack of conscience\nOur sanctity bears no relevance\nInsignificance is our existence\nHear the litany of life's persistence\n...\n\n",
