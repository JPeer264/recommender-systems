        "I'm dreaming of death, I take deep dive.\nThe rest of my life will drown in your eyes.\nThe words in my mouth will take your heart.\nRepeating the rhyme that reveals my disguise.\nI feel your pain,\nInside of my dreams where is nothing to see it all.\nI fall into you and I take it all down, and reach for my dawn.\n\nI will blacken your eyes and mute your mouth,\nBlind love is the bound.\nI reach to your heart it's cold inside,\nI'll suffer in flames that burns my eyes.\n\n...\n\n",
