        "I'll be home, my darling\nPlease wait for me\n(Wait for me)\nWe'll stroll along together\nOnce more our love will be free\n\nAt the corner drugstore\nEach Saturday we would meet\n(We would meet)\nI'd walk you home in the moonlight\nAll of these things we'll repeat\n...\n\n", 
        "My love must be a kind of blind love\nI can't see anyone but you\n\nAre the stars out tonight?\nI don't know if it's cloudy or bright\nI only have eyes for you, dear\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm in the mood for love\nSimply because you're near me.\nFunny, but when you're near me\nI'm in the mood for love.\n\nHeaven is in your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "You must remember this\nA kiss is still a kiss\nA sigh is just a sigh\nThe fundamental thigs apply\nAs time goes by\n\nAnd when two lovers woo\nThey still say I love you\nOn that you can rely\n...\n\n", 
        "It seems we stood and talked like this before\nWe looked at each other in the same way then\nBut I can't remember where or when\n\nThe clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore\n...\n\n", 
        "Love walked right in and drove the shadows away\nLove walked right in and brought my sunniest day\nOne magic moment and my heart seemed to know\nThat love said Hello - Hello darling\nThough not a word was spoken\n...\n\n", 
        "When they begin the beguine\nIt brings back the sound of music so tender\nIt brings back a night of tropical splendor\nIt brings back a memory ever green\n\nI'm with you once more under the stars\nAnd down by the shore an orchestra's playing\nAnd even the palms seem to be swaying\nWhen they begin the beguine\n\nTo live it again is past all endeavor\n...\n\n", 
        "I do love you\nl-o-v-e\nl-o-v-e\nl-o-v-e\nl-o-v-e ahh\n\nYou taught my heart\nAway to see ahh\nAnd you gave my arms the right to cling\nThats why I love you\nl-o-v-e\nl-o-v-e\nl-o-v-e\nJust love you I do\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Mio Amore\nTake my lips and a kiss them\nTake my love\nTake my hands and hold them\nI am yours my love\nTill the end of time\nMio Amore\nTake my arms let them hold you\nTake my love\nTake my eyes let them show you\nI am yours my love\nTill the end of time\n...\n\n", 
        "The night is like a lovely tune\nBeware my foolish heart\nHow white the ever constant moon\nTake care my foolish heart\n\nThere's a line between love and fascination\n...\n\n"
