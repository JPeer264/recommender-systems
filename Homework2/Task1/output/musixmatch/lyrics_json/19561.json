        "Get the fuck up\n\nUp in the corner\nBeen gone for so long\nIt's back there in town\nAnd rise, up out the wild town\nSo many secret\nAnd trail no one\n\nBut most came in to beat them\nWatch all they're entwined\nWhat about you\nWhat about you\n\nAnd I go get you down\nIt's over when you come\nBetter hold on\nBetter hold on\n\nI'll fight these wars\nI'll fight these wars\nIt's too much more,\nYou and I\nForesee what lies\nForesee it hide\nIt's too much more, you\n\nHell always awaits you\n...\n\n", 
        "What then.\n\nAnd it comes screaming\nFrom all this dreaming\nPeople falling\nNo one's open\nI see new colors\nNot like the others\nName your rapist\nOnly once\n\nSave my life, save my life\nSave my life, save my life\nWalk on through, this hatred\nWalk on through, this hatred\n\nIt seems like I've lost my strength\nAnd though you won't go\nLove is not when we don't know\nIt gets through\nIt gets through\n...\n\n", 
        "No sleep\nNo sleep for me\nNo sleep\nNo sleep for...\n\nNot what we wanted\nNot what we wanted to be\nNot what we came for\nNot what we came to be\n\nI think you're holding your own\nI think you're holding your own\nIt seems a wasted life\nIt seems so...\n\nAnd I'll remember\nI'll remember not to forget\nWhat all this means\nWhat all this means\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I love you\nI hate you\nThe one that kills me\nAnd without it\nAll bets off\nCan't erase it, leave\n\nEyes of lies\nEyes of lies\n\nTogether\nIt's on\nThe one that held you\nAnd we call\nYour downfall\nThe one that separates\n\nAnd never mind\nThe state of mind\nThe one that makes me survive\nThose are my...\n...\n\n", 
        "And there's the police\nSo we'll all hurt me\nSee who's merciful (?)\n\n(gunshot)\n\nUgh!\n\n(coughing)\n\nRoll on over\nOver and over\nRoll on over\nSince you could\n\nAnd I've been counting\nBy these hands, yes\nI've been counting\nBy these hands, yes\n\nThis is why, I'm about to...\nThis is why, don't ask why\n...\n\n", 
        "Go!\n\nI swear to God,\nYou need to feel this,\nLife fades away,\nAs it deals it,\nMy hate's awake,\nAs it deals it,\nAnd my pain's to rated to lose it,\n\nRun like the wild (edit: i dont think this is right)\nToo mad to be on my own,\nTry, try, try not to feel this,\nI'm healed and sore,\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah!\n\nBet you don't remember\nWhen that feather burns\nTry to remember just how long\nTry to remember just how strong\n\nSecrets falling down\n\nTools just like you\nwhich I'll take your blames\nJust last season\n...\n\n", 
        "Put it in your water,\nPut it on your wall,\nAnd it doesn't matter,\nUntil you fall,\n\nAnd the kids are running the classroom,\nRunning the classroom, gone.\nBut it doesn't matter,\nUntil you fall...\n\nThrow yourself away, (Throw it away)\nThrow yourself away, (Throw it away)\n...\n\n"
