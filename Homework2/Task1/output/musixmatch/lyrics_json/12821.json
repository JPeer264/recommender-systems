        "Are you going to Scarborough Fair\nParsley, sage, rosemary and thyme\nRemember me to one who lives there\nShe once was a true love of mine.\n\nTell her to make me a cambric shirt\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you know my name\nIf I saw you in heaven\nWill it be the same\nIf I saw you in heaven.\nI must be strong, and carry on\n'Cause I know I don't belong\nHere in heaven...\n\nWould you hold my hand\nIf I saw you in heaven\n...\n\n", 
        "See the stars come falling down from the sky\nGently passing, they kiss your tears and your cry\nSee the wind can't stop me blow your hair from your face\nAnd the rain come falling down in its crazy way\nOooh\nStill I'm sad, still I'm sad\n\nOh, myself, my tears just fall in the dust\nThey will dry every night we find the love\n...\n\n", 
        "So close no matter how far\nCouldn't be much more from the heart\nForever trusting who you are\nAnd nothing else matters...\n\nNever opened myself this way\nLife is ours, we live it our way\nAll these words I don't just say\nAnd nothing else matters...\n\nTrust I seek, and I find in you\nEvery day for us something new\nOpen mind for a different view\nAnd nothing else matters...\n\nNever cared for what they do\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "We walked in the cold air.\nFreezing breath on a window pane,\nLying and waiting.\nThe man in the dark in a picture frame,\nSo mystic and soulful.\nA voice reaching out in a piercing cry,\nIt stays with you until.\n\nThe feeling has gone only you and I.\nIt means nothing to me,\nThis means nothing to me,\n...\n\n", 
        "Hello darkness, my old friend,\nI've come to talk with you again,\nBecause a vision softly creeping,\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping,\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence.\nIn restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone,\n'neath the halo of a street lamp,\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\n...\n\n", 
        "In this proud land we grew up strong\nwe were wanted all along\nI was taught to fight, taught to win\nI never thought I could fail.\n\nverse two:\nNo fight left or so it seems\nI am a man whose dreams\nhave all deserted.\nI've changed my face,\nI've changed my name\nbut no one wants you when you lose...\n\n(Sarah Brightman)\nDon't give up - 'cause you have friends\nDon't give up - you're not beaten yet\nDon't give up - I know you can make it good.\n\nThough I saw it all around\nnever thought I could be affected.\nThought that we'd be the last to go\nit is so strange the way things turn.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Forgive is a word I am learning\nIf only to pass the time\nI love you for all your weakness\nI love you for all your lies\nWill you grow\nWill you understand\nThe damage you caused in time\nThe past is behind we are facing\nA punishment for the crime\n\nThe gift you gave me\n...\n\n", 
        "When you're weary, feelin' small,\nWhen tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all.\n\nI'm on your side. Oh, when times get rough\nAnd friends just can't be found.\n\nLike a Bridge Over Troubled Water, I will lay me down.\nLike a Bridge Over Troubled Water I will lay me down.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "See the stone set in your eyes\nSee the thorn twist in your side\nI wait for you\nSleight of hand and twist of fate\nOn a bed of nails she makes me wait\nAnd I wait without you\nWith or without you\nWith or without you\nThrough the storm we reach the shore\nYou give it all but I want more\nAnd I'm waiting for you\n...\n\n", 
        "If Joan of Arc\nHad a heart\nWould she give it as a gift\n\nTo such as me\n...\n\n", 
        "I sit and wait\nDoes an angel contemplate my faith\nAnd do they know\nThe places where we go, when we're grey and old\nCause I have been told\nThat salvation, lets their wings unfold\nSo when I'm lying in my bed\nThoughts running through my head\nAnd feel the love is dead\nI'm loving angels instead\n\n(chorus)\n...\n\n", 
        "When the evening falls\nand the daylight is fading\nFrom within me calls\nCould it be I am sleeping?\nFor a moment I stray\nthen it holds me completely\nClose to home, I cannot say\nClose to home, feeling so far away\n\nAs I walk the room\nthere before me a shadow\n...\n\n", 
        "You ask me where to begin\nAm I so lost in my sin\nYou ask me where did I fall\nI'll say I can't tell you when\nBut if my spirit is lost\nHow will I find what is near\nDon't question I'm not alone\nSomehow I'll find my way home\n\n\nMy sun shall rise in the east\nSo shall my heart be at peace\nAnd if you're asking me when\nI'll say it starts at the end\n...\n\n", 
        "Imagine there's no heaven\nIt's easy if you try\nNo hell below us\nAbove us only sky\n\nImagine all the people\nliving for today...\n\n\nImagine there's no countries\nIt isn't hard to do\nNothing to kill or die for\n...\n\n", 
        "Your day breaks\nYour mind aches\nYou find that all the words of kindness linger on\nWhen she no longer needs you\n\nShe wakes up\nShe makes up\nShe takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry\nShe no longer needs you\n\n\nAnd in her eyes you see nothing\nNo sign of love behind the tears\nCried for no one\n...\n\n", 
        "There was a time when there was nothing at all\nNothing at all, just a distant hum\nThere was a being and he lived on his own\nHe had no one to talk to, and nothing to do\nHe drew up the plans, learned to work with his hands\nA million years passed by and his work was done\nAnd his words were these...\n\nHope you find it in everything, everything that you see\nHope you find it in everything, everything that you see\n...\n\n"
