        "She's gone through all her life\nAs is she knew that nothing special\nWas ever gonna happen\nWith no will to fight\nBut with a strong need of possession\nNothing in return\nYou see her now\nShe looks so old\nYou try to read it right from her face\n(Is there still any feeling?)\nShe's back from faraway\nAlone and forgotten\nWill you still love her?\n\nAfter she gets home\nShe don't know\nYou can't deny no more\nShe's gonna lose all your love\nAfter she gets home\nShe don't know\nIs she strong enough?\nShe's gonna lose all your love!\n\nThings will never be the same\nYou gave her a hand\n...\n\n", 
        "If I were to die today\nI think that I wouldn't care\nIf I were to numb my pain\nI think I'd rather fade away\n\nMy love is crying\n'Cause my love\nMy love is dying\n\nIf I were to feel again\nI wonder what would make me feel\nIf I were to love again\nI wonder if I could believe\n...\n\n", 
        "You and I\nIt's getting colder\nAnd all our feelings overflow\nNow it is time\nTo talk it over\nIt's too intense to let it go\n\nThere's so many reasons\nI just have to carry on\n\nOur sentimental love, where is it gone?\nI should have known it from the start\nAnd all I want is to escape from home\nBut I'll never do without your love babe\n...\n\n", 
        "When I was younger I believed\nIn what they were telling about\nTolerance and love\nI believed that they really\nWanted to understand and forgive\nBut now it's all gone\n\nAnd I can see with my eyes\nAnd I can feel with my heart\nIt's gone forever\n\nI say good bye to the roman candles\nI really have to go\nBefore light and shade\nTurn into the dark\nI'm in a magic circle\nAnd all my faith is gone\nMy soul is wandering round and round alone\n\nI say good bye to the misty towers\n...\n\n", 
        "Emmilou is pretty\nEmmilou's fine\nAnd I wonder I wonder\nWhat's on her mind\nI saw her twice in the \"Royal Blue\" caf\u00e9\nEmmilou she's pretty\nAnd I'm a little bit scared\n\nI go there every Sunday\n...\n\n", 
        "Those big territories \nSome mysterious lands \nOh I can hear they are calling \nCalling my name \nI've been here long long time \nOh long enough \nNow I feel I should hurry \nI'm taking off \n\nI don't wanna turn \nThe whole world upside down \nI'm only trying to find my own way \nI don't wanna think of all that lost time \nThere is nothing to blame \nBut myself \n\nI need every hour \nTime's running like crazy \n...\n\n", 
        "I know what you are\nAnd I know what you feel\nIt's like a big scar\n\nThe strain of the moment\nAnd you're lost like a child\nThere's always been something\nParalyzing me\nAnd darkness she will hug you to her breast\nOh when will you get back home again?\n\nI know what you are\nAnd I know what you feel\n...\n\n", 
        "Still got the blues in my heart\nI will never forget you\nIt tears me apart\nI've been trying hard\nTo forget your name, babe\nI've been praying to god\nTo be calmer and safer\nI'm deadly in love with you\nAnd you know it's true\nI'll say it all over and over again\nStill got the blues\n\nI knew it right from the start\nI would give all my life, babe\nTo keep you around\nNo I wasn't much careful\n...\n\n", 
        "Water's dripping from the trees \nI'm waiting in my car \nI'm biding all my time in memories \nI see a man passing by \nHe smokes a big cigar \nProbably there's something \nHe needs to tell me \n\nOh take my soul with you \nI'm going away \nTake my soul with you \n...\n\n", 
        "I spent a lot of my time\nLooking at clouds from all sides\nI saw them roll in the big sky\nSo much crying in the rain\nI keep all the lights on\nTo ease my soul but all in vein\n\nSo I'm running\nTrying to get\nOut of the rain\nI'm running\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm running away from you\nAnd you're trying to get me down at your feet\nYour only waiting to see me crawl\nAdmitting, all what I did was wrong\n\nYou're the truth\nYou're the eye\nI can't hide\nI'm too exposed to your filtering light\n...\n\n", 
        "This time my blood's flowing faster\nThings have gone too far\nYou really got me busted\nI'm sick and tired\nTo hell with cheap illusions\nAnd you're dragging my patience back and forth\nI know, everyone strolls \nThey can go wrong\nBut now I fell it somehow\nI can't let it go that easy, I'm gonna...\n\nOne day you will find me gone\n...\n\n",
