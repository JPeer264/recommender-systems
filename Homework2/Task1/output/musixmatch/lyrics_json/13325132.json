        "I am a man, man, man, man\nUp, up in the air\nAnd I run around, round, round, round this down town\nand act like I don't care.\nSo when you see me flying by the planet's moon,\nYou don't need to explain if everything's changed\nJust know I'm just like you.\n\nSo I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head.\nAnd I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue, yellow, violets, red.\nAnd suddenly a light appears inside my brain\nAnd I think of my ways, I think of my days and know that I have changed.\n\nIt's the colors you have\nNo need to be sad.\nIt really ain't that bad.\n\nIt's the colors you have\nNo need to be sad.\nYou've still got your health\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "Cruising on the highway with my friends, top down\nAnd we're all on our way to the beach.\nAnd everyone keeps laughing at the those cars we are passing\nas we're sucking down that funny, funny weed.\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nAnd we're rolling up to sand\nTake your shoes off, man\nWe are skinny dipping underneath the sea\nAnd it's a chicken fight Clan\nThrow your dukes up, Wham!\nWe are splashing in the water to the beat.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "So you travel 'round this country\nYou're looking for your holy ghost.\nAnd what you gonna find\nIs it's somewhere, you like to hide.\nSo you run around your ego, you run around your gold coast.\nYou know you got the time\nBecause this prison is our own design.\nSo you thinkin' of our future,\nYou're thinkin' of some old past.\nAnd it's your time to shine,\nSo what you're gonna go and leave behind?\nAnd there's no one left to be in with and there's nothing left downstairs.\nWhen you feel despair, what's your method to get outta there?\nSo where you from, son?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",

        "One, two, one, two, three, four\n\nYeah, I step outta my little country\nI traveled seasons, took a longboat\nAnd now I find myself in a small town\nIt's so remote, I couldn't trawl\n\nSo I kissed my mommy, I wanna sweet cheeks\nAnd I told my dad I'm real glad that we're friends\nSaid to my brother I'll surely miss him\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
