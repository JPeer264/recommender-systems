        "You gotta admit Life magazine made 1968 look great.\nMy father said it sucked, everybody died.\nAll the troops you couldn't save, no one knew how to be brave.\nHe said sometimes you were afraid to turn your radio on.\nIt was enough to make you quit that peacenik scene.\nWell I heard about leaders, yeah I hear they're no longer around.\nCause peace was abandoned, and bravery hanged in his town.\nAnd they passed down a sentence for building on the beauty of some dream.\n\nAll my heroes are dead. I got them in my head, saying\nNever again, never a war, no more fighting.\nSo I'll stay true to them, and they'll come home again.\nI'll carry the light, follow the dream. I'll remember.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I was pounding the streets for a friend who could find\nSome hope out've hope torn apart.\nI would point to my chest say Here it is, it looks real tough.\nWon't be broken again, but still it's my heart\nWith full-listening ears and best intention.\nThey so want to know and with no comprehension.\nThis town, such a weary place.\nLove-lorn, sleepy falling race saying\nOh not that song again.\nOh no they played our song again, well\nSomething should be for everyone.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's the start of a new life day.\nOh yeah, right, like I haven't heard that one before.\nYou know everything I try to quit I only want it some more.\nSo I let the weeds grow up, call them flowers of the common man.\nBut in my head, in my head, I can hear the gentle voices say,\n\n'Stop smoking, take a deep breath and stop smoking\nThen you can take more deep breaths, stop smoking.\nSpend a few more days with your family and friends.\nAnd if you want to keep hitting that high note, stop smoking.\n\nAnd I won't do it for another soul.\n...\n\n", 
        "The blue it speaks so full.\nIt's like a beauty one can barely stand.\nOr too much things dropped in your hand.\nAnd there's a green like the peace in your heart, sometimes.\nPainted underneath the sheets of ashy snow.\nAnd there's a blue like where the urban angels go, very bright.\nNow the Calder mobile tips a biomorphic sphere.\nThen it swings its dangling pieces round to other paintings here.\n\nYour behavior is so male.\nIt's like you can't explain yourself to me.\nI think I'll ask Renoir to tea.\n...\n\n", 
        "Come lovers, come loners, remember yourselves\nAs lusty tempestuous fools.\nWhen to dream was to conjure an ocean\nFrom your small secretarial pools.\nWhen you stood a the Gulf of Unknowing.\nWhen you saw the great Tundra of Time.\nAnd you cried for the winds to come blowing.\nAnd you called a monsoon from the tides of the moon.\nCause the roads were all dusty and dry\nGone rain dancing lonely tonight.\nWhen what should appear in the distance.\nBlowing hither and yon, it's Calamity John.\nAnd he's coming to sweep you away.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's a small town life and I like it\n'Cause the bad don't get in your way\nThere's an angry God gonna strike it\nYeah, that's what we pay him for, that's why we pray\nWell I guess the angry God he was a-fishing\nWhen Molly called me up with the news\nWithin the space of a week\nYeah, a pervert or a sex freak\nLet the kids take a peek\nThat's more than a little cheek\nNo pun intended\n\nAy-yi-yipee-yipee-yi-yi-ay\nGoing east of Mississippi got a flinty kind of woman\nAnd you don't act smart and you don't touch my children\nIf the young man wants to see the sun go down\n\nWell there was no time fooling with the trifles\nSo there was no use in telling the men\nThey would just go running for their rifles\nAnd then once you got him couldn't get him again\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh I fell in love, like they do in the magazines,\nOn a football field, it was a long daydream.\nAll my high school spent in faithful disbelief\nI know that he looks dumb, but he's smart underneath.\nThey say I'm a bright kid, and I have a future,\nWith the Puritan blessing of Work to be done,\nBut to see him cradling that beer is all that I'm seeing.\n\nBut now it's college days, and now I'm driving home\nWith my list of books to read and that self-important tone\nAnd my parents, I read them like the news\nI know where they went wrong and they're not friends I would choose.\n...\n\n", 
        "When I want to go somewhere, I don't ask forgiveness\nI just go where I like, and he knows that.\nI walk alone into any party, I'm alone tonight\nIn that high-heeled ego old hat.\nOh blue night, laughter at the bell toll.\nPeople move like streaks of charcoal.\nSomeone found a prince in the punchbowl.\nBut high times fizzle out in a change of heart,\nAnd we know things fall apart.\nThe morning's off to a bad start.\nIt's raining. Have you had nights like this?\nI run miles to his place, wake him up to look at his place.\nI feel astray, and I love it when it gets that way.\n\nThe child is so young, they say that child is truly free\n...\n\n", 
        "Go ahead, push your luck\nFind out how much love the world can hold\nOnce upon a time I had control\nAnd reined my soul in tight\n\nWell the whole truth\nIs like the story of a wave unfurled\nBut I held the evil of the world\nSo I stopped the tide\nFroze it up from inside\n\nAnd it felt like a winter machine\nThat you go through and then\nYou catch your breath and winter starts again\nAnd everyone else is spring bound\n\nAnd when I chose to live\nThere was no joy, it's just a line I crossed\nIt wasn't worth the pain my death would cost\nSo I was not lost or found\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Can you fix this; it's a broken heart\nIt was fine, but it just fell apart\nIt was mine but now I give it to you\nCause you can fix it, you know what to do\n\nLet your love cover me\nLike a pair of angel wings\nYou are my family\nYou are my family\n\nWe stood outside in the summer rain\n...\n\n", 
        "I never thought you were the letter writing type\nNow I see the words you chose, the way you write\nSo I started to write back about the trees and the snow\nAnd I saw a bird, couldn't say what it was\nBut I thought you'd know, you always surprised me\n\nAnd if I wrote you, if I wrote you\nYou would know me and you would not write me again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've never had a way with women\nBut the hills of Iowa make me wish that I could\nAnd I've never found a way to say I love you\nBut if the chance came by oh I, I would\nBut way back where I come from, we never mean to bother\nWe don't like to make our passions other people's concern\nAnd we walk in the world of safe people\nAnd at night we walk into our houses and burn\n\nIowa oh ooo oh, Iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I Iowa\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The first part of every day for me is good\nI've got the bus stop in my neighborhood\nAnd everything's on purpose everywhere they go\nHiding in my car and running in the snow\n\nRunning with the friends they'll know for years\nI've seen it all from here, from here\n\nIt happens every day, before they go to school\nThey play until the bus drives up beside my lawn\nAnd there's always been a mother who waits 'til they are gone\nThen she turns away\nIt happens every day\n\n...\n\n", 
        "my name is mary magdalen\ni come from palestine\nplease excuse these rags i'm in\ni've fallen on hard times\nbut long ago i had my work\nwhen i was in my prime\nbut i gave it up all for love\nit was his career or mine\n\njesus loved me this i know\nwhy on earth did i ever let him go\nhe was always faithful, he was always kind\nbut he walked off with this heart of mine\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't go to therapy to find out if I'm a freak\nI go and I find the one and only answer every week\nAnd it's just me and all the memories to follow\nDown any course that fits within a fifty minute hour\nAnd we fathom all the mysteries, explicit and inherent\nWhen I hit a rut, she says to try the other parent\nAnd she's so kind, I think she wants to tell me something,\nBut she knows that its much better if I get it for myself...\nAnd she says\n\nWhat do you hear in these sounds?\nWhat do you hear in these sounds?\n\nI say I hear a doubt, with the voice of true believing\nAnd the promises to stay, and the footsteps that are leaving\nAnd she says \"Oh,\" I say, \"What?\" she says, \"Exactly,\"\nI say, \"What, you think I'm angry\nDoes that mean you think I'm angry?\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Amber called her uncle, said \"we're up here for the holiday\nJane and I were having Solstice, now we need a place to stay.\"\nAnd her Christ-loving uncle watched his wife hang Mary on a tree\nHe watched his son hang candy canes all made with red dye number three\nHe told his niece, \"It's Christmas Eve, I know our life is not your style.\"\nShe said \"Christmas is like Solstice and we miss you and it's been a while.\"\n\nSo the Christians and the Paegans sat together at the table\nFinding faith and common ground the best that they were able\nAnd just before the meal was served hands were held and prayers were said\nSending hope for peace on earth to all their gods and goddesses\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm not a leader, i'm not a left-wing rhetoric mobilizing force of one,\nBut there was a time way back, many years ago in college, don't laugh,\nBut I thought I was a radical, I ran the hemp Liberation League with my\nboyfriend,\nIt was true love, with a common cause, and besides that, he was a Sagittarius.\n\nWe used to say that our love was like hemp rope, three times as strong as the\nrope that you buy domestically,\nAnd we would bond in the face of oppression from big business and the deans,\nBut I knew there was a problem, every time the group would meet everyone would\n...\n\n", 
        "I wonder if Yoko Ono\nEver thought of staying solo\nIf she thought of other men and\nIf she doubted John Lennon\nWorrying that he'd distract her art\n\nSitting in the Apple sessions\nGiving John her music lessons\nChallenging the warring nations\nWith her paper installations\nDid she guard her Yoko human heart\n\nWell, they could talk about me\nYeah, they could talk about me\nThrow me to the velvet dogs of pop star history\nBut I won't be your Yoko Ono\nIf you're not good enough for me\n\n...\n\n"
