        "Since the creation of the holy doctrines\nEach fragment of life wants to be saved from death\nSome have rebelled against peace\nTo accomplish new prophecies that will bring chaos\n\nGuided by Satan's hands and mind\nThere's a void instead of their eyes\nOrgies and massacres show no escape\nEvil is the ultimate vermin\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Below the lid of a vast rounded monument\nTrickling of gristly vestiges and whacked hopes\nEnhanced by the horrible excess of fetid exhalation\nAnd uterine strangulation by the wreaths\nOf the herds astray, arid in despair, blessed\nWith dilated flakes of fire, slowly wafting down...\nSay, what does a maternal heart feel when merely\nVinegar stills your child's thirst?\nYou'd implore to harbour his torment in your chest...\nTo make this burden yours, but... Sacrilege!\nWho are you, harlot, to interfere with His emerald will\nWhen even your glance should never leave the soil?\n\nThere resides the fusion, there is the nucleus\nAngel prick and holy semen,\n...\n\n", 
        "Arising from the cursed abyss,\nOur mission has been given by the fallen angel\nWe are demons in human flesh,\nBorn to desecrate God's creatures until total extinction\n\nWhile the holy ones kneel down and forgive,\nWe believe in the powers of hate and annihilation\nOur thirst for giving a painful death\nWon't be relieved before the end of this earthly aim\n\nThe elite is immortal\n...\n\n", 
        "Hunting like wolves, \nwe have no regrets for all our murders, \nbarbaric and inhuman. \nThis is a crusade, \nan unholy quest against the holy spawn. \nThe only morals we belive in are pleasure of hate, \nas sons of darkness. The blood shall flow, \nthe liquid of life, it will disappear. \nFear can be seen on their tearful faces. \nFollowers of God will meet their doom. \n...\n\n", 
        "Suffer\u2026 I hate you\u2026 I want you dead.\nMy dagger in your heart, I stabb twice\u2026\nPleasure\u2026 to see the blood flow\u2026\nI lick the liquid of life\u2026\nHail to Death! Hail the Ultimate Void! Ave Satan!\n\nAfraid to die, I see it in your eyes\u2026\n...\n\n", 
        "Born a fullmoon night,\nIn the middle of moutains cold\u2026\nWolves feasting on your mother's remains,\nShe died in pain, you laughed out loud.\n\nBeasts and a black wizard\nTeached you forbidden things.\nYou learned to spill the blood\nAnd to enjoy its unholy taste.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Walking afraid in dust\nAmong memories, among ruins,\nFeeling the cursed moment has come\u2026\nSoon, the ancient veils shall fall\nAnd reveal the forgotten truth.\n\nAn old crypt, bones and skulls lying around,\nTraces of useless life, of god's defeat\u2026\n...\n\n", 
        "A vaste void, darker than black\nAnd colder than Satan's Wrath\u2026\nA long path behind, full of hate,\nFull of despair, it was the way of the strong.\nFeared by many, respected by few,\nThe warlord stands proud, his blood covered sword in hand.\n\nSuddenly, light and warmth\u2026\nIs it an illusion?\n...\n\n", 
        "Our skies are forever black\n\nFor burning spirits we are\nHere is no signs of life at all\nConsuming your small universe\nSlowly but surely\n\nNo one believes in us\nWe came from realms of Hell\nNo eyes can see us\nWe're not made of flesh and blood\nIn times past we reigned everywhere\n...\n\n", 
        "I am the Evil in every form\nThe demon you abondon yourself to.\nHungry for an hatred without equal\nI am the one who brings the pain for the end\nI am your suicide\nI am the rope that strangles you\n\nI am the razor slashing your wrists\nI am the poison in your blood\nI am the bullet going through your head\nI am the wicked in every man,\n\nDelighted every at every morid? death\n...\n\n", 
        "Death is coming fast \nShe's my only faith \nAnd no one will be ignored \nThis is a sick quest \nI know I'm insane \nBut I don't want to be cured \nRelentessly \nI'm the desecration master \n...\n\n", 
        "Acid streams from the Chalice over the newborn body,\nPain rises like deadly waves of sulphur\nAnd it cries with despair and supplicates\nAs it dissolves its sweet flesh\n\nSee, Satan... Lethal Baptism for all children!\nHopes for future generation disappear\n...\n\n", 
        "Born of the void as a female human,\nSha was full of innocence and weakness\n(Lust... Pain... mother of perversion)\nHer own face soon betrayed her\nIt was time for demoniac vengeance\n(Lust... Pain... mother of perversion)\nThen came her suicide to rejoin Satan,\nHer Father that teached her how to Fight the plague\n(Lust... Pain... mother of perversion)\nNow she is the mistress of sin\n\nDebauching the humans one by one\n...\n\n", 
        "No place to hide, its time to suffer\n\nAfter the tracking come the tortures\nTremble at the thought of this unholy revenge\nYou'll worship the Devil before you piss away\n\nThe legions will catch each normal human being\nWhy do they ask for weak values like mercy or tolerance?\nThe answer to their miserable life is a painful death\n...\n\n", 
        "Ah-ah-ow!\n\nSay! Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time.\nDon't they know that you're full of pain already?\nYes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time.\nDecadence isn't easy, is it?\nYes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time.\nDon't they know that you're full of pain already?\nYes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time.\nDecadence isn't easy...\n\nThen you slowly recall all your mind.\nWhy, your soul's gone cold, and all hope has run dry.\nDead inside.\nNever enough to forget that you're one of the lonely.\nSlowly recall all your mind.\n\n...\n\n",
