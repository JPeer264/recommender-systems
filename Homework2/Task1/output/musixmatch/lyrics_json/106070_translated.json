You may well laugh. I certainly did when I wrote it down in my portentous breakdown column. I felt better.\n\nThe young woman in question then went on to have affairs with gay men. I put it all down to her father, who is a retired naval commander who invested his money in footling projects like selling clip-on car boots which only fitted one model of Rover, which was then withdrawn.
