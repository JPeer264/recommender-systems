        "We're on the run to night\nWe never face the dark down and lonely\nWe never loose control cause we're making our distance so close\nIn other words you better give your friends all you can\nIf it makes you sweat you better ask your self am I good or bad\n\nAfter all we have done it's still running in your veins\nWhen the night turns to day you're still living without fear\nYou feel a hunger for this life all through the night\nIt's still running in your veins\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "It's dark the night is cold\nI feel the chill and ask myself why\nWhy couldn't I see that it was to late for me\nTears on my cheek putting a stain in my face\nThere's nothing to do nothing to change\nI'm tumbling down\n\nYou've been fading away since yesterday\nBut the fool in me wants so bad to turn back the time\nSo where did I go wrong?\nI never sensed the truth\nBelieve in me\nThe darkest age has just begun\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
