        "I call the mighty prophet\nTaint my sword with blood\nHelp in my holy \"JIHAD\"\nAs I tear, kill and maim\nAll is done in your name\n\nFor me God shall do the same\nMy faith is left to blame\nEven though our God is one\nYou'll just spill blood\nIt shall be done\n\nThis all shall die\n...\n\n", 
        "Enriched with crimson shades of pain the river runs dry\n\nFull of painfull memories of happiness - together we fly\nAnd I curse you death - cold flesh of ice\nI see your beauty through a halo of flies\nOh God prevent my fall\nOh God inside my soul, Allah!\nThe night falls upon my wretched self\nAnd he who hath forsaken the giver of my purity\n...\n\n", 
        "Deliver the love out from your body\nGrieving nights to you, I'm hard as stone\nBodies sweat in the heat of the moon\nAfter you're gone I'll be all alone\n\nDrinking the fluid of love\nEternally my beloved ones sweat purple wine\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The rain falls, the snow storms\nThe gods unleash their wrath\nThe summer comes, sunlight swarms\nFairies of magic laugh\n\nThe green of leaves forsakes now\nBefore to be exchanged with gray\nBefore the king of winter bow\nAnd begin your wish to say\n\nAs autumn falls upon us\n...\n\n", 
        "My heart flies on her wings\nNow I'm crying, the moon so red\nTomorrow shall be yet another hell\nTo the sun, (the) sky's soul is fed\n\nBlows pass me\n(I'm) down them I do not feel\n...\n\n", 
        "From the arising of the golden sun\nTo the gloomy shadow of the moon\nThe wind still whispers\nWhile I'm standing here by myself\n\nI'm waiting for a sign that could lead me\nAway to the land of the divine\n\nBut when weariness starts to affect,\nThe eclipse of the sun came to earth\nI hide from the sun and try to live\nAnd I know deep in my heart\n(That) this is a life that God cannot give\n...\n\n", 
        "Sahara\nThe rain keeps on falling\nFilling the dried land\nIt drinks the purity of life\n(The) land stars to grow\nIt must be a sign - a message from God's hand\nLike tears from the sky\nWater begins to flow\n\nLeft alone, deserted so long ago\nThe storm still rages inside\n\n...\n\n",
