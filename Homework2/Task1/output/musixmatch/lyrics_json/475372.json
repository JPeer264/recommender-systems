        "2 Brothers On The 4th Floor\n2\nFly (Through The Starry Night)\nCome on lift your head high\nReaching out for the sky\nSpread your wings out and fly right through the starry night\nYou're unique, you're o.k.\nNever must be afraid\nSpread your wings out and fly right through the starry night.\nThrough the starry night. (2x)\n\nMove as I groove on.\nNow put your dancing shoes on.\nIt's time to realize you can rise to the top.\nNow don't you ever stop.\nSometimes in live when you feel like giving up.\nYou got to keep your head up.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
