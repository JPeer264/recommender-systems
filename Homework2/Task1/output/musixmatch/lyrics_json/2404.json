        "it's hard to be tender \nit's hard to stay open \nwhen you're dizzy with anger \nand your dreams have been broken \nlying with you 'neath the sky \nthe country is so green in the light \nloving you's the key to my survival \nnow, you have gone away \nthe skies turned grey \nthe rivers froze \n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
