        "Big Love\n\nYou need a man to get lost in\nWith a heart big enough to roam\nNo more fences for you to look through\nWith your heart caught in a strangle hold\nI've got a love full of wide open spaces\n\nI've got a big love\nWild and free\nRoom to grow\nAs big as your dreams\nDeep as a river in a raging flood\nAs endless as the stars above\nI've got a big love\n...\n\n", 
        "(Shawn Camp - Harley Allen)\n\nWell, my car broke down outside of town\nUp ahead I saw a farm\nSome white-faced heifers chewin' on that cud\nthought cows can't do no harm.\n\nLackin' better sense I jumped the fence\nAnd went crashin' through the corn\nFrom the corner of my eye I wondered why\nOne of them cows had horns.\n\nWell, he seemed to be approachin' me\nAt quite a rapid pace\nDoes he want me to pet him\nOr does he just want to race?\n...\n\n", 
        "(Mark Nesler - Tony Martin)\n\nThe kind of love that I've been looking for\nI'm not sure they make it anymore\nIt's easy to fall for a pretty smile\nIt works real good for a while\nYill the new wears off\nAnd it starts to fall apart.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, I said, friend\nDon't take her, she's all I've got\nPlease don't take her love away from me\nNow, I'm begging you, friend\nDon't take her, she's all I've got\nShe's everything in life I'll ever need\n\nShe is life when I want to live\nShe's everything to me in life that life can give\nShe's my water when I need a drink\nAnd she's the first thought in my mind\nEach time I try to think\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(Dean Dillon - Larry Bastian)\n\nLately the ties that bind\nFeel like a noose around my neck\nChoking the life from me\nAnd leaving my dreams gasping for breath\n\nI've lost sight\nAnd so have you\nOf the man you were attracted to\nWe lost me somewhere along the line.\n\nAnd I can't live like this no more\nKnowing just outside that door\n...\n\n", 
        "Tommy and Janey barely eighteen\nHolding hands at the jewelry store\nEyes open wide staring inside\nAt the ring that they wanted for her\n\nMister bring it closer mister can we hold it\nI think it's gonna fit just fine\nAs he slipped it on her hand Janey kissed her man\nDon't love make a diamond shine.\n\nDon't love make a diamond shine\nIt don't matter if it costs a dime\nDang thing looks like a million bucks\nSittin' on the hand of a girl in love.\n\nA perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt\nIf the heart don't wear it\nWith three little words it'll knock you blind\n...\n\n", 
        "(Mark Nesler - Tracy Byrd)\n\nTonight on a plane bound for Dallas\nI see the bright lights of Tucson below\nShining on all of the mem'ries\nI thought I'd finally let go.\n\nIt's been almost a year now\nSince I told her I could not stay\nAnd this aching in my heart that I'm feeling\n...\n\n", 
        "(Harlan Howard - Kostas Lazarides)\n\nI don't believe that's how you feel\nI don't believe that you don't love me\nGuess I must have hurt you bad\nI didn't mean to make you sad\nAnd I sure regret the things I told you now.\n\nI don't believe that we're all through\nI don't believe that it's all over\nLet's forget who's right or wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "(Mark Nesler)\n\nHe's driving me out of your mind\nYou're goin' crazy over him I see the signs\nHe won't leave you alone he's with you all the time\nDriving me out of your mind\n\nCan't he see that you still haven't gotten over me\nAnd you're just not in the mood for company\nIs he really fool enough to think he has a chance\n...\n\n", 
        "(Chris Crawford - Tom Kimmel)\n\nI don't need to go on pretending\nI don't need the key to your door\nWhy would I leave goodbye open-ended\nThat's not what goodbye is for.\n\nNow I don't have one thing against you\nYou're breaking my heart not the law\nThe angel I made you into had to fall\nI'll miss you, I love you that's all.\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, I woke up this mornin'\nAnd I was feelin' fine\nBut with my first cup of coffee\nCame the last thing on my mind\n\nIt hung around uninvited\nThe whole day through\nIt didn't care that I'd been trying\nTo keep from missing you\n\nThat's the thing about a memory\nIt's got a mind of its own\nIt can take an old flame\nAnd chill you to the bone\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I was feeling down\nI'd really been uptight\nAbout to lose my mind\nWhen I came in here tonight\n\nThings have turned around\nSince they turned the jukebox on\nI laid my money down\nAnd somebody played my song\n\nAnd I'm back in the swing of things\nAn amazing change takes place\nWhen I hear them twin fiddles play\n\nOh, there's a difference of daylight\nAnd dark in my heart\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I could search from now till the end of time\nAnd never find another you\nI'm so glad because I know you're mine\nSomeone to give my love to\n\nI believe my love that you're one of a kind\nFor there's no one else like you\nYou're the light of my life so let it shine\nSomeone to give my love to\n...\n\n", 
        "(Thom McHugh - Bill Kenner)\n\nI'm face to face with an angel\nHow'd you get those eyes so blue\nYou're a vision in white and I been waitin' all night\nJust to have one dance with you now all my dreams are comin' true.\n\nI'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight\nEverything about you is so perfectly right\nI've never been there but I think\n...\n\n", 
        "(Larry Bastian - Dewayne Blackwell - Earl Bud Lee)\n\nWhere in a barroom when last night\nWhat was I doing I was holding someone tight\nWho oh just someone who didn't mean a thing\nHow well I just slipped off my wedding ring.\n\nWhy I don't know, I didn't mean to hurt you\n...\n\n", 
        "(Melba Montgomery - Kostas Lazarides)\nTracy Byrd & Dawn Sears\n\nToday an old heartache came calling\nAn old flame I thought died out like some falling star\nInstead it's rekindling some mem'ries\nThat may start an out of control raging fire.\n\nThat look in your eyes brings back mem'ries\nYou still have that same smile that once won my heart\n...\n\n", 
        "(Glenn Sutton - Jim Weatherly)\n\nYou packed up all my clothes\nAnd put 'em by the door\nIs this your way of telling me\nI don't live here anymore.\n\nYou've gone and called a cab\nAnd told me where to go\nTwo hearts that used to be on fire\nHave just gone up in smoke.\n\nNow I ain't no magician\nCan't change the way things are\nI can't make you love me\n...\n\n", 
        "(Ron Hellard - Charles Quillen)\n\nI had the operator call me back\nShe said my phone is working fine\nI hear in Louisville it's almost dawn\nBut it's 2 a.m. Pacific time.\n\nI thought sure she would've called by now\nTo tell me all about that wild and crazy LA scene\nWell, I know my number's in her book\nWhy don't that telephone ring?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "(Paul Nelson/Tom Shapiro)\n\nAll at once here I am in this barroom\nOh and most any night I'd be home\nBut those old thoughts of her\nAre beginning to stir\nI need to be anywhere but alone\n\nWhen you close you can call me a taxi\nUntil then you can call me a fool\nSo just bring a glass and don't bring up the past\nIf you did I don't know what I'd do\n...\n\n", 
        "(Curly Putman - Don Cook - Bucky Jones)\n\nIt's lonely out tonight down here in Georgia\nAnd the oldest friend I've got I met today\nThe womon that I love just up and left me\nAnd the place I love's a thousand miles away.\n\nOperator hook me up to Houston get me anybody on the phone\nLook there in your book and pick a number\n'Cause you can't be choosy when you're this alone\nWon't you talk to me Texas let me hear that draw\nI spent my last five dollars on this one long distance call.\n...\n\n",
