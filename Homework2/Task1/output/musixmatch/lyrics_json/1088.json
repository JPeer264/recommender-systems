        "People hold on\n\nEverybody's looking for a meaning\nEverybody's doing their own thing\nAnd nobody's solving the problem\nAin't nobody helping each other\n\nSome people give into fear\nSome people give into hunger\nSome of us live for the future\nSome of us wonder\n\nGive a little light, give a little love\nMaybe there's enough for everyone\nGive a little hope, and a little trust\nMaybe there's enough for everyone\n\nPeople hold on\nDon't do yourself wrong\nPeople hold on\n...\n\n", 
        "Telephone, got me hanging on the line\nTelephone, wasting all my time\nI can live without my telephone\n\nTelephone, got me hanging on the line\nTelephone, wasting all my time\nI can live without my telephone\n\nI can live without my telephone\n\nTelephone, got me hanging on the line\nTelephone, wasting all my time\nI can live without my telephone\n\nTelephone, can't you leave it till I'm through\nTelephone, we've got better things to do\nI can live without my telephone\n...\n\n"
