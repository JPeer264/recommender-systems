        "Little White House in a little old town\nStuck in the middle of nowhere\nStars shine bright when the sun goes down\nit's a perfect world as long as you're there\n\nCount my blessings and save my prayers\nLove waking up in the morning\nSunlight shining upon your hair\nand you're lying next to me\n\nBlue sky over fields of green\nI'm as happy as i've ever been\nOne thing makes it all so clear\nit's a perfect world as long as you're there\n\nCount my blessings and save my prayers\nLove waking up in the morning\nSunlight shining upon your hair\nand you're lying next to me\n...\n\n", 
        "Rain Rain Love\nRain Rain Love\nRain Rain Love\nRain Rain Love\nThrew out my old raincoat\nSet sail without a boat\nFor places somewhere far beyond my dreams\nAs the sky came pouring down\nI lay down on the ground\nLike I was dreaming, I let the feeling wash all over me\n...\n\n",

        "Here I go again\nHanging on to the bitter end\nAll alone\nNothing left to lose\nDon't want to face tomorrow\nI can't sleep tonight\nBlame it on the weather\nTill I get over you.\nChorus:\nFeels like rain\nFeels like I'll never fall in love again\nThere's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way\nAnd it feels like rain today\n...\n\n", 
        "Every time I wake up somewhere faraway\nCounting all the minutes back to yesterday\nI wonder what you're doing, do you feel this way\nAre you thinking of me too\n\nLooking in the mirror all I wanna see\nIs your pretty face smilling back at me\nThere's nowhere in the world that I would rather be\nThan to be back home with you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I get high when I see you go by\nMy oh my.\nWhen you sigh, my, my inside just flies,\nButterflies\nWhy am I so shy when I'm beside you?\nIt's only love and that is all,\nWhy should I feel the way I do?\n...\n\n",

        "Hey hey now can't you see\nThat's life\nTake a look aroud you now\nSome days your shine\nSome days it all unwinds\nFly high above your fears\nBe sure never let then rain on you\n...\n\n", 
        "Some say it's just the nature of the beast\nWhen you love somebody so passionately\nTime has a way stealing\nThat raging fire you're feeling\nLeaving the ashes laying at your feet\n\nThose fools of little faith will never know\nThose higher places two hearts can go\nWhere time is standing still\nAnd love will burn until\n...\n\n",
