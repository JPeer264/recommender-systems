        "Out in L.A. and broke on the ticket\nthat this fellow sent me\nOne change of clothes in the suitcase\nthat my girlfriend Anna lent me\nI stayed for a while in his place\nrunnin' with this crowd of his\nPartyin' day after day\nmeetin' everybody in the biz\n\nOh, they know how to do it\nin L.A.\nThey know\nhow to make it seem brand new\nThough it's true\nwhat they say\nthat it's only a dream\nAnd a dream\nis a wish you wish for you\nIn L.A the dream may come true\n\nAfter the booze and the coke\nThe visions of the blue Pacific\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
