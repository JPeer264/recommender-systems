        "We could keep texting all night on the telephone\nKeep on pretending like we're not alone\nWe could lock down the plans about seeing that cover band playing on Friday night\nBut all that waiting 'round\nJust to see you later now\n\nSeems like a waste of time\nGotta see you right now, right now\nDon't waste another minute\nStart your car and get on in it\nRight now, right now\nAnd head on straight to me\nI want to see headlights turning in my drive\nGirl it won't take you no time\nYou wouldn't believe just, how much I need ya\nI gotta see ya\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If I could make a living out of lovin' you\nI'd be a millionaire in a week or two\nI'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do\nIf I could make a living out of lovin' you\n\nEarly every mornin' when the sun comes up\nI'm punchin' that clock on the wall\nBreakin' my back just to make a buck\nWishin' I was in your arms\n\nIf I could make a living out of lovin' you\n...\n\n", 
        "The last day of school was the first of June\nMe and Bobby watched the clock all afternoon\nWaitin' for the bell and Mrs. Greer\nTo say have a good summer, see you next year\n\nThat night I couldn't sleep 'cause the very next day\nThey started up the summertime matinees\nWith a different movie every afternoon\nAt the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two\n\nMe and Bobby rode rockets into outer space\nWe drove Daytona and we won the race\nWe shot a lotta bull and some bad guys too\n...\n\n", 
        "I pour two cups of coffee\nPut the paper on the table\nSo we can share the morning news\nYour voice answers our phone when we're not home\nFriends who call leave a message here for you\nEvery night I leave the light on, you're just working late\nAs far as I can see everything is still the same\n\nAnd my heart will never know\nSo I don't fall apart\nI fool myself for another day\n...\n\n", 
        "You bought my love with a lot of sweet nothin's\nPromises and lies\nHad all I want of your kind of lovin'\nIt's time to say goodbye\nAfter all you've given me\nDon't look so surprised\n\nWhat do you want for nothin' baby\nA solid gold guarentee\nThat you get everything you need\nBut there is no love in it for me\nYou wanna deal on the way I feel\nBut I'm not buying that\nWhat do you want for nothin' baby\nYour money back\nWhat do you want for nothin' baby\nYour money back\n...\n\n", 
        "Been trying so hard just to talk to you\nHaven't heard half of what you want me to\nI hurt so bad over where we've been\nDon't know how not to go back there again\nI know what I want to say\nCan I get it through to you now\nIn some other way\n\nCHORUS\nLike there was this woman and there was this man\nThere was this moment they had a chance\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm gonna polish my best boots\nI'm gonna put on my best hat\nI'm gonna drive on down to the dancehall\nThat sits by the railroad tracks\nWell the band there mixes fiddles\nWith a wailing saxophone\nAnd when they play that swing it only means one thing\nYou're gonna boogie till the cows come home\n\nThere's a wood stove in the corner\nThere's saw dust on the floor\nThey've got a flashing neon Lone Star sign\nHangin' by the door\nAll they sell is beer and setups\nSo you'll have to bring your own\n...\n\n", 
        "The sun's reflecting off the city limit sign\nI better keep moving before I change my mind\nLookin' in the rearview mirror\nComin' home didn't make it clearer\nI didn't wanna hear her say goodbye\n\nHeartache Highway why didn't I say\nWhat she wanted to hear\nWhy must the most important words go unspoken\nHeartache Highway now it's too late\n...\n\n", 
        "I never thought it would hurt me so bad,\nseeing you look so good\nyou're moving on and you're not looking back,\njust like I hoped I would\nhow did you just stop loving someone\nand turn what we had into nothing\nI wish I could\n\nyou make it look so easy,\nthe way that you got over me\nyou act as if you leaving\n...\n\n", 
        "Last night is the last time she's ever leavin' me\n'Cause I've taken all the past times and I've stored 'em in my memory\nShe probably thinks I'm crazy\nShe probably thinks I've lost my mind\n'Cause when she drove away, well I just waved goodbye\n\nIt's been one time, two times, three times more\nThan I can bear to stand\n...\n\n", 
        "(Kim Williams/Clay Walker/Kent Blazey)\n\nLet's go to Louisiana boys\nWay down in Louisiana where the moss and cypress grew\nYou'd find old Jack in a shotgun shack\nIn the back of the black bayou\nSome folks called him crazy but I knew better than that\nHe kept a hundred dollar bill tucked away in the brim\nOf his dirty old cowboy hat\n\nJack told me a story when I was ten years old\nHe said there was once a fool tried to swim this swamp\nWith his back weighted down with gold\nHe said you should've seen that alligator smile\n...\n\n", 
        "So long, see you around\nSeen all I wanna see of this town\nI'm out of time and I'm out of tears\nOut of my mind and I'm out of here\n\nWho needs the heartache baby who needs the pain\nWho needs to hang around and take the blame\nWho needs a woman to make him blue\nWho needs you baby - I do\n\nWhy are you wearing that negligee\nSure makes it hard to walk away\nI gotta go I can't take this abuse\n...\n\n", 
        "The frost is on the ground in this tiny Texas town\nAnd you're packing up the U-haul in the yard\nI gave you everything, all I'm taking is the blame\nAnd you wonderin' if I'm gonna fall apart\nWell, darling I won't have the heart\n\nI won't have the heart to love again\nJust ask anyone who knows\nI won't have the heart to love again\n...\n\n", 
        "Once again he's left you here crying\nIt hurts me to see him hurt you this way\nOnce again here I am trying\nTo make the tears desappear from your face\nFor your sake\n\nLet me take that heartache off your hands\n...\n\n", 
        "She knew she caught my eye\nAnd that was all it took\nAin't it strange how forever changed\nWith just one look\n\nThe magic filled the night\nShe touched my soul like no one else\nYes, the way that woman made me feel\nLeft me talking to myself\n\nYou better run for cover\nYou better hide your heart\n'Cause once you start to love her\nYou know you'll never stop\n\nShe shines like a diamond\nWhen she walks into a room\n...\n\n", 
        "Well baby, I ain't gonna lie\nThis ain't my first ride\nI've saddled up and bruised my hide a time or two\n\nIt's true I'm not a brand-new man\nI've been around the block and back again\nBut I've already been broken in, yeah, I'm the one for you\n\nAnd well, if you don't mind a hand me down heart\nI've got just the thing for you\nIt's been used and it's been bruised\nBut it still beats like new\n\nIt's got a few burned valves, it's a little worn out\n...\n\n", 
        "When you left, I told myself\nI wouldn't let you haunt my mind\nI'd be strong, I'd carry on\nAnd leave the past behind\nI'd just forget we ever met\nAnd find somebody new\nAnd now I want you to know\nI'm almost over you\n\nChorus:\n\nThe only time I ever miss you, honey\nIs when I'm alone or when I'm with somebody\nYour memory never even gets to me\n'cept when I'm awake, and when I'm sleeping\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to wake up nights\nCallin? out your name\nThen i'd cry myself back to sleep\nKnowing i'd only dreamed\nI stayed inside for days\nTrapped within my mind\nWonderin? where you had gone\nConvinced I could not go on\nNow just when I started feeling\nThose hands of time start to healing\nYou're here at my door\nSaying your new dreams\nHave led you back to me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When the moon pulls the tide\nThe ocean don't ask why, it just follows\nNo one has to tell the trees\nIt's time to grow new leaves down in the hollow\n\nAnd I've heard it said\nIt's all part of the good Lord's master plan\nAnd now I understand why\nEvery time you walk in the room\nI find myself reaching for you\n\nI don't even have to try\n...\n\n", 
        "(Chuck Jones/Chris Arms)\n\nGot a long list of things to do\nIt begins and ends with gettin' over you\nI can't quit 'til I'm through\nI get up with the sun and go down with the moon\n\nPain and tears\nCan't be all there is\nIs it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under\nBaby you're nothing but too much trouble\nGotta bury this love and bury the shovel\n\n...\n\n", 
        "See that cowboy at the bar\nThe one at the end with all the scars\nHe got stomped by the meanest bronc in Santa Fe\nBut if he looks a little down and out\nIt ain't that bronc he's thinking about\nIt's that girl that broke his heart along the way\n\nWhen a cowboy falls, he falls hard\nAnd sometimes he falls way too far\nAnd you can bet that when he hits the ground\n...\n\n"
