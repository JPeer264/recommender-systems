        "Forced to endure 12 years of subliminal mind conditioning,\nEmancipated only to be enslaved once again,\nThis time sentenced 25 to life in a congested cubical,\n(Consumption will consume you)\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Surveillance cameras cover every inch of every street corner,\nSchools and now even locker rooms,\nAnd I'm beginning to wonder what the fuck happened\nTo the Constitution\nReplaced by the Patriot Act and Homeland Security Plan.\nBut I wont stand idly by while they enforce martial law\nAnd the last of our freedoms are legislated away.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "1040 forms and fiat currency share much in common,\nlike absolute illegitimacy and paper construction.\nno income-tax law exists, nor does tangible value in a dollar,\nbut every day someone goes to prison over one or the other.\n\nA 1913 scheme with aim to reach neo-feudalism\nby stripping Congress of the Constitutional power they were given\nwould guarantee unpayable debt, generations born into a prison\nthe death of the nation began with the birth of the federal reserve system.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Fear the coming years, for they will bring famine and drought,\nDevastating storms and floods as polar ice caps melt,\nHell on Earth unless standards of living are significantly reduced,\nwith a global tax on carbon emissions so that less is produced.\n\nFrom forced sterilization to one-child policies,\nJail time for eco-crimes to a tax on the very air we breathe,\nThe rise of global government and the decline of individual liberty.\nFreedom must be sacrificed to fight the impending climate catastrophe.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "End justifies the means.\n\nMachiavellian philosophy guides their mentality to maintain\npower no matter how many casualties it may cost in the end.\n150 million killed by their governments last century.\nHistory teaches us lessons they hope we will forget.\n\nHitler's inspiration came from American eugenicists and\nsterilization lawas passed in the U.S. The CIA protected Nazi\nscientist under Operation Paperclip.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "As cathode ray tubes induce alpha brainwave hypnotic states in\npopulations mesmerized by five hours of television every day,\nSuggestions flow into the subconscious without\nviewer participation,\nand fewer and fewer corporations control this\nweapon of mass disinformation.\n\nWith rapid technological advancement it would only be a matter of\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Iris scanning. Microchipping. Wiretapping.\nCataloging information on innocent citizens lives...\n\nIn this panopticon society of slavery.\nA culture of sheep with no concept of privacy.\nThose who question the system are demonized because\nwhy would you mind if you have nothing to hide?\n\nIf you have nothing to hide then why the fuck would you mind?\nWhy the fuck would you mind that they torch the Bill of Rights,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "The first step to revolution is consciousness,\nSo I wont stop screaming at you until this all make sense.\n\n\"Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists\", says the president.\nIn that case I'm with the \"terrorists\".\n\nIts 2006, and we're still labeling indigenous individuals \"terrorists\"?!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "In need of an excuse to seize total control of Germany, the Nazis coordinated the false flag burning of their own building. Followed by a staged attack against a radio station, Hitler won the people's support for a German invasion into Poland.\n\nFast forward to a CIA coup in Iran when they overthrew Mohammed Mosadeq. From machine gunning crowds to bombing houses with no regard for innocent civilians as they staged terror attacks. A well-documented fact that governments use false flags to further hidden agendas.\n\nDoes the Gulf of Tonkin ring a bell? The reason we fought a war in Viet Nam. Well it turns out they never fired at us. Little damage resulted from this staged provocation except the deaths of 58, 000 Americans and more than a million Viet Namese. A war only good for political elites, just like every other war it seems. While they sleep soundly at home our families...\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Our hope is fleeting, vanishing without a trace\nThe constant progressing of their ultimate goal; human enslavement and global control\nBreaking down the barriers that define who we are, generalizing us as inferior\nFire is burning in the minds of the vigilant\nThe collective awakening of those willing to fight against an empire so malevolent\nWe will not be, slaves to our fate\nOnly to be labeled unpatriotic, an enemy of the state\nThis is only the land of the free, as long as it's the land of the brave\nWe are all born into slavery, but I refuse to die that way\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
