        "Deep slumber awakened by sirens\nI realize life's been thrown to the lions\nWhat I saw last night, our city so fair\nAnd to my horror, the bloody town square\n\nThe time is now, we must avenge\nWe form tonight, we kill tonight\nWe must rest to regain our strength\nWe form tonight, we kill tonight\n\nBattalion advances surrounding their backs\nIn the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy\nWe'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us\nHear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to avenge\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Your woman's unfaithful, she's got a backdoor man\nYou've seen the signs and you understand\nThey'll soon be dead, now, I know just what to do\nI got the guns, ha-ha, I got the tools\n\n[Inaudible]\nIn the name of all, I'm just a hitman\nI'll get the job done\nNo one will ever know it was you, it was you\n\nThey got their men promoted before it's time\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "[Blackmore / Gillian / Lord / Paice / Glover]\nHighway Star (Deep Purple cover)\nNobody gonna take my car\nI'm gonna race it to the ground\nNobody gonna beat my car\nIt's gonna break the speed of sound\nOooh it's a killing machine\nIt's got everything\nLike a driving power big fat tyres and everything\n\nI love it and I need it\nI bleed it yeah it's a wild hurricane\nAlright hold tight\nI'm a highway star\n\nNobody gonna take my girl\nI'm gonna keep her to the end\nNobody gonna have my girl\nShe stays close on every bend\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
