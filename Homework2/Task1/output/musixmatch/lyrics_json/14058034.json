        "The scent of my hands is familiar\nto prostrated men in their call\nto guide me their spirits\nfrom fire, fire, fire, fire\nwhose speak was so tenderly\nwhose speak was so tenderly coaxed\n\nThe tinge of my eyes is familiar\nto prostrated men in their call\nto get close, close, close\nto their closetly homes\nIlluminate the worlds of the ghosts\n\nEars ring and teeth click\nand ears ring and teeth click\nand ears, ears\nEars ring and teeth click\nand ears ring and teeth click\nand ears ring and teeth click\n...\n\n", 
        "Bring, bring the thunder\nAnd the loud, loud rain\nLead our woes asunder\n'Neath the proud, proud veins\n\nOf traits that bleed the gunmen\nOf our pumping, earthly hearts\nWeen our joys in plunder\nFeel our shining teeth\nBet our hold on happiness\n\nBead-weighted chests with lofticries\nLofticries with trembling thighs\nWeepy chests with weepy sighs\nWeepy skin with trembling thighs\n\nYou must be hovering over yourself\n...\n\n", 
        "I came down over the sleepy mountains where our\nWide toes plunged into the weeping shale to tear our\nSkin up off from the bottom leaves our ankles bare\nDon't just wander back and forth and leave it\n\nBuild it into pinnacles and shrines of some\nSome ghastly predicament of mine you'll find\nLeaves us plastered to a bed of hairs with\nMe all coiled up near the bottom with my chest unbeared\n...\n\n", 
        "Grandma, my sleep is narrow\nbid you bring me some strong drink\nStrain out the pulps and set them close outside\nfor when my belly\nfor when my little belly speaks\n\nGrandma, there's air beneath my bed\nand it whispers\nand it whispers when I rest\nwith hemmed skirts\nand salt and vinegar, vinegar\nand water closely\nOh, water closely underhead\n\n...\n\n"
