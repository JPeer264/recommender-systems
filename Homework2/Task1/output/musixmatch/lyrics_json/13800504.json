        "I don't like walking around this old and empty house\nSo hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear\nThe stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake\nIt's the house telling you to close your eyes\n\nSome days I can't even trust myself\nIt's killing me to see you this way\n'Cause though the truth may vary this\nShip will carry our\nBodies safe to shore\n\n(Hey! Hey! Hey!)\nThere's an old voice in my head that's holding me back\nWell, tell her that I miss our little talks\nSoon it will be over and buried with our past\nWe used to play outside when we were young\nAnd full of life and full of love\n\nSome days I don't know if I am wrong or right\nYour mind is playing tricks on you, my dear\n'Cause though the truth may vary this\nShip will carry our\n...\n\n"
