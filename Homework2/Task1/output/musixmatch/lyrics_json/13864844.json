        "So tired of waiting,\nI'm halfway out the door again\nSometimes I wonder,\nJust why we're in the same place\nAgain, again, again, again, again\nIt's as if we like the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain\n\nI don't know why but I can't let go\nThough it kills me slowly\nI can't say no\nAddicted, it's twisted, but I can't resist\nSo beautiful it hurts\nSo beautiful it hurts\nSo beautiful it hurts\nAnd it hurts, hurts, hurts, whoah oh\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I'm walking down the road less traveled\nIt's harder when the sun is shining\nCause the light's not fair\nI'm talking to my darkest shadow\nThis love is do or die\nBut they don't care\nI don't know why\nI do this to myself\nIt's not right\nBut I can't love no one else\nNo one else\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Look at the sky\nThe sun won't ask, the world if it can rise\nLook at your mind\nAnd ask yourself, what keeps you trapped inside\n\nLook at the lies\nThey follow you, when you run and hide\nLook at the sky\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
