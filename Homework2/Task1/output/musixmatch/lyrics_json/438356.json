        "Take my body to Seven-Mile Island.\nLay my head down where Indians sleep.\nTake your shoes off and walk across the water.\nIt's been so long so I heard a man speak.\nWatch the spillways when the water starts rising.\nTake your hat off when the sun goes down.\nKeep your eyes on that concrete tower.\nMaybe one day it will crumble to the ground.\n...\n\n", 
        "They tell me you walk on the water now\nI know who showed you the stones\nYou pray that I banish my appetite and lie there alone\n\nI hope that you've practiced your instrument\nI fear it will take you away\nYou ain't the type to be traveling, so why not just stay\n\nHere it is morning for some folks\nand twilight for those of us left\nwho sleep while the soldiers get sunstroke\n...\n\n", 
        "You better watch yourself this time\nOn your waiting in a long line\nOf kicking off a slow crime\n\nI guess the Devil wouldn't have you\nBut you used who what you're used to\nYou always seem to somehow\nmake it through\n\nI know I let myself go\nbut I try to let you know\nit's hard to be alone\n\nI know I never took my own advice\nChased a couple rollin' dice\nSomewhere I don't belong\n\nI can't make myself be good\n...\n\n", 
        "I saw her in Roosevelt Springs\nWhere time doesn't touch anything\nShe never did say she could sing\nBut I figured it so\nI needed some company then\nNot sisters or children or men\nThat's a hell of a spot to be in\nBut she put me in tow\nMoney and liquor and lust\nHad taken my heart and my trust\nI could see ashes and dust\nHeaded my way\nShe tended bar in the town\nHer alto settled me down\nSo I started hanging around\nDidn't need much to say\nShe smelled like cigarettes and wine\nAnd she kept me happy all the time\nI know that ain't much of a line\n...\n\n", 
        "See the man with the military mind\nTrying to make us all afraid all the time\nTrying to make us all stay inside\nAnd lock our doors and windows\nSee the man's got too much to count\nTry to recollect the sermon on the mount\nBlessed are the poor\nWhen they're all swinging from the gallows\nBut I ain't afraid no more\nI ain't afraid no more\nI ain't afraid no more\nNo, I ain't afraid\n'Cause however long the night, the dawn will break again\nWe'll be around when you have lost your oldest friends\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "Don't roll away that stone, girl\nLeave it where it lay\nYou think he's coming home but you know it's not today\nI think the road will break me and never fill the holes,\nbut every time I'm saved I stop beating out a soul\n\nI'm too scared to ask the right questions\nand too tired to fill the right shoes\n...\n\n", 
        "We'll say a friend of mine, a fella I know real well,\ncame to me on Friday and he had a story to tell\nI've heard it a thousand times, but this one hits close to home\nThe woman who left him I've taken for my own\nLove leaves you no choice in the matter\nand there ain't a damn thing sadder than a man\nin the throes of something real\nThe woman that lays down beside you,\nshe can't help or hide you\nIt don't matter how she wants to feel\n...\n\n", 
        "You want her to try new things\nShe reminds you she wears your ring\nand after a couple drinks she's a little scared of you\nA good friend is hard to find\nYou wish you could spend more time\ntowing civilian lines, but they're all scared of you\n\nIt's not the time that makes it go bad\nIt's not the thought of what you could've had\nIt's not the way that her figure has changed\nIt's just that a soldier gets strange\n\nYou know she's a real good girl\nShe reminds you that every curl\n...\n\n", 
        "Where's that angel with dirty knees\nWho wasn't hard to please when we first met?\nShe don't act like she needs me now\nAnd she don't even seem to be upset\nMaybe I cover too much ground\nI've been from town to town since I grew up\nCould my dreams take up too much space?\nI'll never find a place that's big enough\nWell, the chairs go up on the bar now\nAnd the table lights go black\nSo I order one last double\nStart calling people back\nMarc sounds good, he's been working hard\nHe couldn't punch a card to save his life\nSays he's glad that he quit the road\n...\n\n"
