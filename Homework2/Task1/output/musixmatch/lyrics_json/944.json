        "Those thieving birds\nHang strung from an empty nest\nThis swan plagued pond\nForesaken and under whelmed\nThose leaving words\nHang strong from an emptiness\nHang strong from an emptiness\nThose thieving birds\nHang strung from an empty nest\n\nThose thieving birds\n\nThis is tearing me apart\nIf the sun won't shine\nForever will never be fine\nUnderneath the hollow ground\nLies a night time sky\nFor only a desperate eye\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
