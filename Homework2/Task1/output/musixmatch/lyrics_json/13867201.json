        "Please wake up why you sleeping?\nI've been awake but you heard me breathing.\nNo I don't know how to tell you.\nI just don't want to be lost too.\n\nBut on and on and on you told me.\nNothing is wrong, it never will be.\nAll the time I knew that that's not true.\nWe used to say that we're forever.\nRunning around do nothing better.\n\nI have something to say, before I go.\nThat anything is enough for two.\nAll I wanted was to share it with you.\nNow my heart's on a different path.\nAnd I... can see nobody there.\nBut I will always remember your smell.\nThe way you walk and how you laugh as well.\nYou made it clear what I had to do.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "No one else is here\nJust the sound of silence that I do not fear\nCounting every star I wonder where you are\nHave you forgotten that I'm the one you once adored\nI remember when you said:\nI like it when you do that thing with your dread\nYou wanted me to stay\nI knew it would be late\nand by that time we were standing in your door\nI was  scared although I wanted you some more\n\nI realise you're so hard to know\nand I wonder were we are\nI can hear you calling\nAnd it will never be the same but you remain\nYou're always in my heart\nI can hear you calling\nI can hear you calling now\nYes I can hear you calling\nI can hear you calling now\n\nIt's easiest to fall\nBut not to lose your pride\nThey say it's best for all\nWhat more can I say\nI miss you every day\nAnd I wonder will it ever be alright?\nIt feels like everything  is here for you tonight\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
