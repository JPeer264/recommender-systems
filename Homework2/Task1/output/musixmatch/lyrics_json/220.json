        "\"What he said was so clear, so true, that I had to stop everything\nAnd concentrate on his lessons.\"\n\nWe need masters in biology, zoology\nTo overtake, illuminati, trick-knowledgy\nTransform, reciprocate your mental state\nNow make a date, to overtake your objective\nShow that through life, that everything is connected\nBut not in categories, cause that's the devil's warning\nSymbols, of cannibalism, ruin your vision\nThen thought formulate in your mind, with no precision\n\nWe paid a crude price, for what they call life\nDubbed without grief, took him out that night\nSome'll ask why, ma say they hate the look in his eyes\nLike the child, little omen, they want him crucified\nThe last on the battlefield, the last alive\nBeside, they don't want the African to survive\nSable, the son of Satan was involved in the plot\nLegalize the homicide, his soul gon' rot\n\nYo, they attempted assassination of Mumia Jamal, they set'im up\nI come to find out, 2Pac they wet'im up\nPharaohe, standin behind my fuckin curtains\nWith a double-barrel, rehearsin'\nReady for war now for certain\nUh, biological warfare suits\nBlack gas masks, black boots, half-assed niggas become troops\nMy dunns are doper warriors, so prove thee now\nPlenty thug niggas are fruity now\n\nFreedom is that cold road seldom traveled, by the multitude\nWe need to depict to describe it, so that we can cultivate this food\nMotivate a few of you fools, regenerate the mood\nFree ourselves from mental bondage, free ourselves from Family Feuds\nNow follow me through this prophecy, building our colonies\nWhere our pillars and columns be, bigger than the coliseum\nI call 'em like I see 'em, the devil does a devil's dance\nThey wanna murder Mumia, take action, it's the only chance\n\nThey tellin' me, son, grab a gun or two, money don't come to you\nStop rhymin 'bout what white people done to you\nLook, burn a blunt or two, screw who you wanna screw\nDo what you wanna do and lesson went to you\nKill all that teacher shit, its too much teased to get\nAnd if Jesus exists, just don't believe in it\nEat the bread of wickedness, join the global Satanists\nGive death row sentences to black revolutionists\n\nNow they will flee and guard, just to feel the power\nNot to justify, that of you and I\nHoldin' daggers up and lettin' you decide\nAfter passin' information that's falsified\nStand behind a lie, what does it cost to die?\nWhat does it cost to live? Why do they specify?\nThese terms of why, when they ain't the most high\nThey fear they will kill, but the soul will never die\n\nThrough seasons, legions and demons, pleadin heathens and even Stevens\nI've wandered through regions, cease freezin, even some breathin\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
