        "It never turned out right\nWith me and you\nNo matter how I try\nTo see it through\n\n*We can not salvage it and start again*\nFeels like trying to catch the wind\nYou are a door to which\nI've lost the keys\n\nwe don't burn so well on this same page\n*We can not salvage it and start again*\nFeels like trying to catch the wind\nAnd I can't carry on living like this\n...\n\n", 
        "the weight of the world is on my shoulders\nand it's just too much to bear.\nit's not that I'm growing callous,\ni'm just too tired to care.\n\nso drop your expectations,\nlet go of any dependencies,\nforget your disapproval\n'cause I'm setting myself free.\n\nlooking up to me,\nlooking down on me,\nand hazarding those sidelong glances.\n...\n\n", 
        "Once you were free and you stretched out your wings to the sky\nsky was the limit, cap on your creativity\nteam against team could we even the score\nour hearts kept the rhythm, that forbidden beat\nyour talons now grip like steel to the weight they chained you to\ntwo in the morning, you can't hear the rumbling train\ntrained not to think or question anything\nthe chains that had bound you are now obsolete\n\nplease open your eyes,\neverything they told you was a lie,\nthink for yourself won't you even try\nto look past all of those lies\n...\n\n", 
        "when you can want something you hate,\nand lie in perfect honesty\nfrom every angle things are crystal clear\nwhen you doubt things of which you're unsure\nyou wonder if your living second rate\nis my mind too open,\nis my heart still beating\n...\n\n", 
        "In my head everything was perfect\nAnd every note resounds in harmony\nAll I seem to offer up are discords\nAnd every note I sing sounds out of key\nAnd every time I play with passion\nI start breaking strings\nAnd my voice cracks\nWhen I sing from my heart\n...\n\n", 
        "I won't let your down\nI will not give you up\nGotta have some faith in the sound\nIt's the one good thing that I've got\nI won't let you down\nSo please don't give me up\nBecause I would really love to stick around\nHeaven knows I was just a young boy\nDidn't know what I wanted to be\nI was every little hungry schoolgirls\nPride and joy\nAnd I guess it was enough for me\nTo win the race? A better face! Brand new clothes and a big fat place\nOn rock and roll TVBut today the way I play the game is not\nThe same\n...\n\n", 
        "how many times will I sit when I should stand\nhow many times have my dreams been just beyond my hand\nhow many times have I compromised\nhow many times have I told myself these lies\n\n...\n\n", 
        "what's the use in hoping\nwhen you always get let down\nwhat's the use in smiling\nwhen all you wanna do is frown\ni'm drowning, in a sea of hate-filled eyes\nand she's screaming\nbut no one hears her cries\nis anybody hear to see a band\ndid anybody come to hear a song\n...\n\n", 
        "Verse 1\n\nImage marred by self-infliction\nPrivate wars on my soul waged\nHeart Is scarred by dual volitions\nJuxtaposed and both engaged\nKindle flame, a test of faith\nPray help me see it through\nI put all my trust in you\n\nChorus\n\nRefine Hate and love\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a phoenix ignition\nlike a crematorium\nLike a swelling volition\nfrom the barrel of a gun\nFrom the ashes and the embers\nlike a rocket I'll ascend\nLike a cry gone up for a fallen friend\nLike a cry gone up for a fallen...\nLike a phoenix ignition\nlike a crematorium\nLike a swelling volition\n...\n\n", 
        "Bound to this couch, I lie in waiting\nWatching wind blown memories\nSlip past my window sill I\nCan't fall asleep\n\nVoice in my head disturbs me\nWaking nightmares keep\nHave my cries fallen on deaf ears\nCan you hear me\n\nOr am I talking to myself again\nIs there anybody listening\nAre you taking this in\nAm I wasting my breath\n\nTell me is the wind in your sails\n...\n\n", 
        "To what end\n\nTo what end do we proceed so boldly\nIf all we are is chemical reactions\nYeah and what world have you, so deftly sold me\n\nIf you reduce me\nIf I have no soul to touch\nNo heart to love\nNo evil to rise up above\nNo angels and no ghosts\nNo real victories to toast\nIf I believe that this is true\nThen I must ask\nTo what end do you proceed?\n\nNo fire in our eyes\nNo steel in our hearts\n...\n\n", 
        "Unabashedly pursue,\nthe Truth that we cannot deny\nA revelation shining through,\norchestration Adonai\nA revolution ultra-blue,\nThe melodic battle cry\nAnd though you say there'll be no coup,\nwe'll never know unless we\n\nTry to see it through,\n(Oh God, we try to see it through)\nand find a different point of view,\n...\n\n", 
        "Only now that you have taught me\n(but how late) my lack\nI see the chasm\nand everything you are was making\n...\n\n", 
        "Misguided satellite I circle by habit\nCan't find my orbit to save my life\nI want to fall, I want to burn\nLike an ignorant crater less meteorite\n\nLong ago I was derailed, long ago the mission failed\nBut in the distance there appears a light\n\nDisgruntled architect building a palace\nCan't make it perfect to save my life\nVictim less crime ride the wrecking ball in\n...\n\n", 
        "Your traps are all baited\nyour scales are all weighted\nbut not resisting you would surely drive me insane\nso im caught and convicted,\nmy rights are restricted\nthe imbecile dynasty continues to reign\n\nyour apathy of thought\nhas lead you to believe\nthat things are what they're not\nmy friend you've been decieved\nthe easiest route rarely leads to the truth\ni see the self approval glaze your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "Our course is coarsely plotted\nOn a map of shoddy dreams,\nBut hindsight will reveal\nTime's moving faster than it seems.\nMaybe I'm just selfish,\nI've got nothing left to give.\nI'm still a foolish boy,\nI've got a lifetime left to live,\n\nAnd I was swinging like a madman,\nNot quite sure of what I felled,\nAnd I might never understand\nExactly what it was I'd held,\nAnd now I watch the sun descending\nFrom the weathered gravel roof,\nAnd I recall the sky once told me\n...\n\n"
