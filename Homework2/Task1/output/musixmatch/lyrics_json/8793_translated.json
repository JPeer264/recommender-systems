        "You got me looking at that heaven in your eyes\nI was chasing your direction\nI was telling you no lies\nAnd I was loving you\nWhen the words you said\nBaby, I lose my head\nAnd in a world of people\nThere's only you and I\nThere ain't nothing come between us in the end\nCan I hold you when you ain't even mine\nOnly you can see me through\nI leave it up to you\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing\nBaby you do it right\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing\n...\n\n"
