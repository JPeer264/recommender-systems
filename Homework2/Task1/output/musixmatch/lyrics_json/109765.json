        "Someone cries and it washes the street with tears\nBut when they are mine, they collect in my head for years\nRain or shine, still I'm standing on all I said\n'Cause it's in my soul, carry on when the feeling's dead\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if you can't hold on\nLet it go and come back in your heart\nAnd if you can't hold on\nMaybe it's not time for you\nAnd if you can't hold on\nOn your very last try\nI'll be there in the morning to pull you through\n\nSomeone dies late at night and I never know\nAnd even if I did, so afraid of the face I'd show\nI feel trapped and enslaved to this dark contrast\n...\n\n", 
        "My My My\nI've got the life taker on my left and the girl on my right\nThe sounds, the lights, the crowd\nCalling to me from every direction saying\n\nMy My My\nThis is it, it's the time just let your instinct take the drive\nAll arms and legs, please keep them inside\nThis moving vehicle at all times\n\nHold your breath as the room spins round\nWe'll dance till there's nothing left\n\nLet us out, its time to steal this town\nBoys Boys\nHands towards the ceiling\nGirls Girls\n...\n\n",
