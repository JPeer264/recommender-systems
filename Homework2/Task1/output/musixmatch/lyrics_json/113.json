        "On a winter's night, stars are cold and bright in the sky,\nThe slumber of the earth is pure and deep\nFrom a distant wood, drifts the echo of a beast\nThe old man stirs and wakens in the night\nHe stands before his window gazing at the grave\nForgotten dreams are flashing through his weary mind\nAnd though his life is empty, he pretends that she's still there\n\nWith hunger in his soul, he yearns for life and love gone by,\nWith memories his one and only joy\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
