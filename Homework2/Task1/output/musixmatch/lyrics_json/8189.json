        "Turn left at the old hotel\nI know this boulevard much too well\nIt hasn't changed since I've been gone\nOh this used to be my way home\nThey paved the road through the neighborhood\nI guess the county finally fixed it good\nIt was gettin' rough\nSomeone finally complained enough\nFight the tears back with a smile\nStop and look for a little while\nOh it's plain to see the only thing missin' is me\n\nCHORUS:\nThat's my house and that's my car\nThat's my dog in my backyard\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah you can see the girl comin'\nFrom a mile away\nShe got her big wheels turnin'\nShe's got Oklahoma plates\n\nShe's got her sun roof up\nShe's got her window rolled down\nAnd you oughta feel the ground shakin'\nWhen she comes to town\n\nChorus:\nYeah I'm in love with the girl and her four-wheel drive\nChrome steel bumpers and red step sides\nShe has a large time in her large machine\nMan I wonder how she gets up in that thing\nIt casts a big shadow sittin' in the sun\n...\n\n", 
        "Word sure gets around in a tattle tale town\nThat why she never goes out at night\nBut when her kids go to school and her husband's gone too\nShe gets in her care and she drives\nTo a little motel on the outskirts of town\nPuts on her perfume and turns the bed down\nAnd I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret\n\nHer husband's always working and he's never home\nWhen he's there with her he's still gone\nAnd she can't stand living and loving alone\n...\n\n", 
        "This world's a jungle there ain't no justice\nLaws of nature rule this land\nBetter hide your horses, bury your whiskey\nHold your woman any way you can\n\nCause there ain't no right or wrong, nothing's carved in stone\nIt ain't cheating if you don't get caught\nJokers laugh and losers grieve\nCause out here there's no honor among thieves\n\nThat woman you've been loving, she was another man's\n...\n\n", 
        "Route 14 Box 308\nShe said goodbye at the cattle-guard gate\nHoping she would find her a place in the world\nWith her mind made up and tears in her eyes\nIt almost made her daddy cry\nHe said don't forget to call when you get there girl.\n\nDriving on that two lane road hoping she might find\nA whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind\n\nMoving upstairs, downtown\nLife's too short to be hanging around\nShe's eighteen and it's time she got out of the wood\nShe's getting out while the getting's good\n...\n\n", 
        "He's flying high tonight, he's got a brand new lover\nHere you come a-runnin', you're looking for some cover\nI know you're sad and lonely, I know you're feeling blue\nYou miss him so much, oh let me get too close to you\n\nOh, he ain't worth missing, oh, we should be kissing\nStop all this foolish wishing that boy ain't worth missing\nI know your head is turning, I know your heart is burning\nGirl, you gotta listen, don't you know he ain't worth missing?\n\nYou know I'm here to save you but you ain't through crying yet\nLook at your pretty face all red and soaking wet\n...\n\n", 
        "Hmm mmm, baby I still love you, [Incomprehensible] gotta start\nYou just ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'\nI still love you baby\nLet's hear some drinking music now\n\nI used to come home late and not a minute too soon\nBarkin' like a dog, howlin' at the moon\nYou'd be mad as an ol' wet hen\nUp all night wonderin' where I had been?\nI'd fall down and say come help me honey\nYou laughed out loud, I guess you thought it was funny\n\nI sobered up, and I got to thinkin'\nYou ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'\n\nYeah I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence\nGone out and lost all my good sense\nAn' too much of work is hard for your health\nI could've died drinkin', now I'm killing myself\nI'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash\n...\n\n", 
        "You've got my heart in unfamiliar territory\nIt's never been out here on my sleeve\nBut here tonight with you it's quite a different story\nYou bring out a side of me no one has ever seen\n\nThere's something I'm afraid to say to you too early\nBut I'd be a fool to wait too late\nMy mind is cautious but my heart is in a hurry\nWhich one's right, it's really hard to say\n\nIn other words\n...\n\n", 
        "Had this dream forever\nAnd it's comin' true at last\nNow lookin' back, the hard times\nWere just lessons from the past\nI finally climbed the highest mountain\nNow I'm standing tall\nThere were sacrifices made\nBut now the price is paid\nTo you I owe it all\n\nYou're not the woman behind the man\nYou are the reason I am who I am\nYou've always been my guiding light\n...\n\n"
