        "There is nothing to see here people keep moving on\nSlowly their necks turn and then they're gone\nNo one cares when the show is done\nStanding in line and it's cold and you want to go\nRemember a joke so you turn around\nThere is no one to listen so you laugh by yourself\n\nI heard it's cold out but her popsicle melts\nShe's in the bathroom, she pleasures herself\nSays I'm a bad man, she's locking me out\nIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these things\n\nLet's make a fast plan, watch it burn to the ground\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Got a big plan, this mindset\nMaybe its right\nAt the right place, and right time\nMaybe tonight\nAnd the whisper or handshake\nSending a sign\nWanna make out and kiss hard\nWait nevermind\n\nLate night in passing\nMention it flip to her\nBest friend, it's no thing\nMaybe it slipped\nBut the slip turns to terror\nAnd a crush to light\nThen she walked in he froze up\nBelieve it's the fright\n\nIt's cute in a way\nTill you cannot speak\nAnd you leave to have a cigarette\nKnees get weak\nEscape was just a nod\nAnd a casual wave\nObsessed about it\nHeavy for the next two days\n\nIt's only just a crush\nIt'll go away\nIt's just like all the others\nIt'll go away\nOr maybe this is danger\nAnd you just don't know\nYou pray it all away\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "It's getting late and we're both tired\nDriving the awkward drive\nPaying half attention as you're pointing the way\nBut our thoughts are racing double the time\nYou told me your stories,\nI told you mine,\nBut theres so much we neglected to say\nDriving back home I had to turn right around\nThere was something that I needed to ask you\n\nWhy cant I just spend the night?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "With her high heel\nAgainst the wall\nKind of dancing\nThough not at all\nShe had\nStockings running up to her thigh\nSnaps her fingers to keep the time\n\nFrom the back of the room\nI saw her there\nI said she wants to be alone and I shouldn't dare\nBut then she noticed me glance at her\nI had no choice but to dance with her\n\nThe lights that move sideways and up and down\nThe beat takes you over and spins you round\nOur hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to cold\nWe're slaves to the DJ and out of control\n\nI watched her feet move\nHer hips they sway\nDoes a hair flip\nThen starts to say\nOh, my god, it's my favorite song\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "She smelled like 2am\nTook him back to her place\nWhere all the saints adorn the walls\nDelivering her from grace\n\nHe knew he should leave\nThat this could only turn cold\nShe was a bad bad girl\nSo he told her so\n\nUnder the shadows of doubt\nHe had the whisper of lust\nHe said no touching tonight\nShe closed her eyes in his trust\n\nShe said tuck me in\nHe knew his judgment was sound\nStill he pulled back the sheets\nAnd said:\n\nYou better lie down cause the angels are watching\nShe closed her eyes and said quit the talking\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
