        "Oh the night makes you a star\nAnd it holds you cold in its arms\nYou're the one to whom nobody verses \"I love you\"\nUnless you say it first\nSo you lie there holding your breath\nAnd it's strange how soon you forget\nThat you're like stars\nThey only show up when it's dark\n'Cause they don't know their worth\n\nAnd I think you need to stop following misery's lead\nShine away, shine away, shine away\nIsn't it time you got over how fragile you are\nWe're all waiting\nWaiting on your supernova\n'Cause that's who you are\n...\n\n", 
        "2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake\nCan you help me unravel my latest mistake?\nI don't love him, winter just wasn't my season\n\nYeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes\nLike they have any right at all to criticize\nHypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason\n\nAnd 'cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable\nAnd life's like an hourglass, glued to the table\nNo one can find the rewind button, girl\nSo cradle your head in your hands\n\nAnd breathe, just breathe\nOh breathe, just breathe\n\nIn May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss\nJust a Day, he said down to the flask in his fist\n...\n\n", 
        "Driving away from the wreck of the day\nAnd the light's always red in the rear-view\nDesperately close to a coffin of hope\nI'd cheat destiny just to be near you\nIf this is giving up, then I'm giving up\nIf this is giving up, then I'm giving up, giving up\nOn love, On love\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I am a man cut from the know\nRarely do friends come and then go\nShe was a girl, soft but estranged\nWe were the two, our lives rearranged\n\nFeeling so good that day\nA feeling of love that day\nTwisting and turning\nYour feelings are burning\nYou're breaking the girl\nShe meant you no harm\nThink you're so clever\nBut now you must sever\nYou're breaking the girl\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh\nThe night makes you a star and it holds you cold in its arms\nYou're the one to whom nobody verses I love you unless you say it first\n\nSo you lie there holding your breath\nAnd it's strange how soon you forget that you're like stars\nThey only show up when it's dark 'cause they don't know their worth\n\nAnd I think you need to stop following misery's lead\nShine away\nShine away\nShine away\n\nIsn't it time you got over how fragile you are\nWe're all waiting\nWaiting on your supernova 'cause that's who you are\nAnd you've only begun to shine\n\nThere are times when the poets and pornstars align\nAnd you won't know who to believe in\nWell that's a good time to be leaving\n\nAnd the past knocks on your door\nAnd throws stones at your window at 4 in the morning\n...\n\n", 
        "2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake,\n\"Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?,\nI don't love him. Winter just wasn't my season\"\nYeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes\nLike they have any right at all to criticize,\nHypocrites.
