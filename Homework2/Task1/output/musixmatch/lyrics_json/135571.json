        "Staring up into the solar system\nAll the stars are fixed up into the sky\nI just want to sparkle for a moment\nBefore i just fizzle up and die\n\nI'm happy because I'm stupid\nScared of spiders, scared of flying\nIf i wasn't so happy\nI wouldnt be so scared of dying\n\nSo just be gentle with me\nI'm not as young as I was\nAnd I'll be gentle with you\nI'm not as brave as I thought\nCos my heart gets broken so easily\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I have weapons and battle plans,\nBut in my heart I know\nI can't ever protect you from\nThings I don't understand.\n\nAnd when I hold you in my arms\nIt scares me just to\nThink that something so beautiful\nCould just come apart in my hands.\n\nI've always been chasing rainbows\nStaring out of classroom windows.\nI don't think I'll ever be happy,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "It was love\nI suppose\nBut I felt sometimes like a snail\nclimbing a rose\n\nAs I felt\nFor your faults\nWet and warm and soft and sealed\nwith calcified salts\n\nAnd still sometimes when\nI think of us just being friends\nIt seems so wrong\nBut if it didn't make you happy\nIt didn't make you happy\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
