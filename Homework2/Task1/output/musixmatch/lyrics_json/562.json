        "I am an American aquarium drinker\nI assassin down the avenue\nI'm hiding out in the big city blinking\nWhat was I thinking when I let go of you?\n\nLet's forget about the tongue tied lightning\nLet's undress just like cross eyed strangers\nThis is not a joke, so please stop smiling\nWhat was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt?\n\nI want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming\nTake you from the inside, baby, hold on tight\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "The cash machine\nIs blue and green\nFor a hundred in twenties\nAnd a small service fee\nI could spend three dollars\nAnd sixty-three cents\nOn diet coca-cola\nAnd unlit cigarettes\n\nI wonder why\nWe listen to poets\nWhen nobody gives a fuck\nHow hot and sorrowful\nThis machine begs for luck\nAll my lies are always wishes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "All I can see is black and white\nAnd white and pink and blades of blue\nThat lay between the words I think\nOn a page I was meaning to send her\nWith you I couldn't tell if it bring my heart\nThe way I wanted when I started\nWriting this letter to you\n\nAnd if I could you know I would\nJust hold your hand and you'd understand\nI'm the man who loves you\n\nAll I can be is a busy sea of spinning wheels\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "There's a magazine called sunset\nAnd a tape machine that won't let\nMe ever forget this impossible longing for you\n\nLet's take a map across your pillow\nAnd breathe the sky in through your window\nI'll stay in the middle\nAnd watch your books cave in\n\nOh, maybe you're my inspiration\nJust lead me to some new sensation\nI'll make a little guide\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "How can I convince you it's me I don't like\nWhen I've always been distant\nAnd I've always told lies for love\n\nI'm bound by these choices so hard to make\nI'm bound by the feeling so easy to fake\nNone of this is real enough to take me from you\n\nOh, I've got reservations\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I need a camera to my eye\nTo my eye reminding\nWhich lies have I been hiding\nWhich echoes belong\n\nI've counted out\nDays to see how far\nI've driven in the dark\nWith echoes in my heart\nPhone my family, tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk\nNo, it's not okay\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Springtime comes and the leaves are back on the trees again\nSnipers are harder to see my friends\nWeeding out the weekends\n\nSummer comes and gravity undoes you\nYou're happy because of the lovely way the sunshine bends\nHiding from your close friends\nWeeding out the weekends\n\nCandy left over from Halloween\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Shakin' sugar from a sugar spoon\nPeppermint tea afternoon\nAlone, alone, alone\n\nTaking a shower take another nap\nWatching television take a bath\nAlone, alone, alone\n\nFeel like a book, but I just cant start it\nFeel like a lover, brokenhearted\nLook in the mirror at the face in the glass\nLook like a question no one ever asks\n\nAlone\nLike I'm supposed to be\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",

        "Venus, stop the train\nFor the brakeman lost his place\nSatellites were spinning and out of space\nThey televised her feelings while the light\nThe light struck terror\n\nI kept my distance because she fell in love with everyone\nSmoking grass and taking Christmas trees\nShe fell in love with me\nI was polite to her\nA soft sadness having much more than her\nLoneliness\n\nHer father warmed the benches\nVice president of southern branches\nHe reached out to her when her mother slept\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
