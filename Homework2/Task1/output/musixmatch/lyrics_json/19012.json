        "Did you crack the sky wide open\nTo find what was inside?\nIs it not what you were hoping?\nAnother case of do or die\nDid you cross the bridgeless scope of chatter?\nDid you say just one thing that mattered?\nDid you skate the cold water of reason?\nInvigorates upon the logic of this treason\n...\n\n", 
        "Hold back the night\nThe streets are filled with laughter\nShe'll not be after you once again\nCome to my house and say we're friends\nI can't help but see\n\nGone are the days\nWe tripped the light fantastic\nIllusion's more drastic\nRunning wild, where did you go to, my little child\n...\n\n", 
        "Between the worlds that I don't say,\nBeneath your sacred nights and days,\nThrough the gales of life and laughter,\nWhen you can't you see what you're after,\nThe evenings and the afternoons\nAre measured up in coffee spoons\nBetween the sunshine and the rain\nI thought I'd have something more to say\n\nIt's a new life for the neighbors,\nWith their name in all the papers, don't you know?\nDon't you know?\n\nShould we go out for a laugh,\nI have a faded photograph,\n...\n\n", 
        "Shut your mouth, and watch my lips,\nCan you feel her healing finger tips,\nComing down, on you like rain,\nSo tell me now where do we remain,\n\nOver my shoulder it goes,\nand where it lands, you don't want to know\n\nI used to work, night and day,\n...\n\n", 
        "You were born with football boots and a sun tan complexion\nYou once thought that on reflection, you'd really got it made\nYou shrugged and smiled and made the usual excuses\nYou suffered small abuses, and settled for their pay\nYou want to learn to live like earnerest the crat (an aristocrat)\nYou bought your girlfriends earrings well that soon put paid to that\nand if the whole world came crashing, down around your ears\nYou could dream of stuck old wallpaper and crystal chandeliers\n\nYou cashed in your cards now you want to buy some glamour\n...\n\n", 
        "Stepping into small life nowhere England\nShaking hands with the big life idiots I was\nTrying to pick up some ordinary-ness\nFrom the shopping bag inspirational quiet\n\nPicking up a detail from a muscle magazine\n...\n\n", 
        "Murderer's come dressed as suicides\nThey drag the donkey's that carry the shit\nWondering where all of that hope went\nI'm telling you now this it\nEverybody knows you sell mouthwash\nAs liquid gold always rusts\nThe roller blade girls concrete the beaches\n...\n\n", 
        "The gods and the saints preserve you,\nCos nobody here deserves you,\nI'm living my life in flashback,\nSince I lost my card or cashback,\nAnd I've gone to wrack and ruin,\nSince I don't know what you're doing,\nThere's no clear or present danger\nThat I see in any stranger.\n\nSomeone, somewhere said to me,\nWill someone somewhere set me free,\nWont hurry up or harry me,\n...\n\n"
