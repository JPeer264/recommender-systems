        "Why do some things stay the same, when some don't\nWe say we'll stay around, oh we know when we won't\nI'm a gross teenager, trapped in a grown-up shade\nNeed someone to clean up the mess I made\nSay it will be fine\n\nOh, friend, will you fly with me into fire?\nIt's New Years' Eve\nWe're allowed tonight to pretend we're free\nPromise me, on New Years' Eve\n\nWe forget about our problems\nWe got time to share all of those things in the New Year\nGot a problem, baby let it be, hopped up on my back\nHave a happy New Years' Eve\n...\n\n", 
        "My desire is ravaging in me\nI see purple mass, stardust light\ndancing in your eyes.\n\nWhat is the use?\nWhere can I start?\nWhen all of you find me crazy\nbecause I have a black heart.\n\nSo what you know about being the best one?\nI will never see\nand what they said about me from time to time\nwill never be true.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh dear, wanna turn the lights off\nSo, our horny souls can have some private time\nWhen the morning comes with the bittersweet\nYou\u2019re just still no hero darling, to prove\nWell hallelujah, it\u2019s a new day\nWe\u2019re a little closer\n\nThey\u2019re slippin away, shadow step on\nIf you\u2019re in love beneath the pain\nWith a bit of sensation\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, what a world I was born into\nWarriors are lying down\nHush little head \u2013 you'll get sick\nSo sorrow-filled I am\nOld wise river take me to the sea\nBreathe free\nLike pilgrims on the Camino\nI go, I go\n\nAll the time I just want to\nLet go and go and... (get a hold of it)\nAll the time I just want to\n...\n\n"
