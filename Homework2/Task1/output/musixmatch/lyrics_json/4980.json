        "Flew off early in the haze of dawn\nIn a metal dragon locked in time,\nSkimming waves of an underground sea\nIn some kind of a dream world fantasy\n\nSun a hot circle on a canopy,\n'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea\nAhead the dim blur of an alien land,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)", 
        "Maybe you see further than I can see,\nor maybe things just look differently\nMaybe I'm nothing but a shadow on the wall\nMaybe love's a tomb where you dance at night\nMaybe sanctuary is an electric light\nI get so tired it's like I'm another man,\nand everything I see seems so underhanded\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613220460)"
