        "I am a man who walks alone\n\nAnd when I'm walking a dark road\nAt night, or strolling through the park\nWhen the light begins to change\n\nI sometimes feel a little strange\nA little anxious when it's dark\nFear of the dark, Fear of the dark\n\nI have constant fear that something's always near\nFear of the dark, Fear of the dark\nI have a phobia that someone's always there\nHave you run your fingers down the wall\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

A Murder of Ravens in Fugue\n\nNow haranguing grey skies\nWith revenge upon life\nGnathic and Sapphic\nNeeds begged gendercide\n\nDelusions of Grandier denounced the revolt\nOf descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults\nEncircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult\n\nWith hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds\nTo Archangels in bondage\nFrom light to night hurled\nCast down to the earth where torment would unfurl...\n\nBut soon\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
