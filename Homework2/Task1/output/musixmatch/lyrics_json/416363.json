        "Denying the lying\nA million children fighting\nFor lives in strife\nFor hope beyond the horizon\n\nA dead world\nA dark path\nNot even crossroads to choose from\nAll the bloodred\nCarpets before me\nBehold this fair creation of God\n\nMy only wish to leave behind\nAll the days of the Earth\nAn everyday hell of my kingdom come\n\nThe 1st rock thrown again\nWelcome to hell, little Saint\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
