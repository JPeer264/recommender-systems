        "First day of a brand new week\nOn a new scene where love's never been\nA new church on every corner\nA new religion; tomorrow it's over\nUgly faces, no entertainment\nThe sea is white; the streets are yellow\nA passing stranger whispered to me\nIf you go inside you'll find a tree\nWhere loves never been\n...\n\n",

        "Down the track at the end of the line\nthere is a station deep underground\nit\"s gonna be your host\nit\"s gonna be your host\n \nrain keep falling down\nthe blues have struck me again\nno beauty wants this flesh \ndoes it scare you\nit\"s gonna be your host tonight\nit\"s gonna be your host tonight\nit\"s gonna be your host \n...\n\n", 
        "I saw a face full of sadness\nCaptured with the loss of yesterday\nYou said, \u0091now I don\u0092t want to be a burden\u0092\nI just want to carry on to make a new life\u0092\n\nThis is a universal love song\nI send it out so everyone can hear\nThis is a universal love song\nI send an S.O.S., are you there?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Monday morning, 7am. I'm ready for a new week on wheels\nThe first thing I do in the morning is to light a cigarette, then some coffee,\nAnd of course the news, It's not anything special, it's a ritual of mine.\nThen I'm on my way to the citadel.\nI'm a taxi drive\nAnd my job is to bring all kinds of people from point a to point b\nSome of them just found love; and others have lost it, but even worst, most of them will never find it.\nA couple of day's ago I picked up this guy at 3-11 porter\nHe had this Nosferatu look in his eyes. His eyes were underground.\nUnderground.\nI think one day I'm gonna quit this job and move far away to Hawaii, or Tahiti\nSomeplace nice and tropical and warm.\nSit on the beach, drink mai tais, get a job in a Hawaiian band, play the ukulele\n...\n\n"
