        "Go!\nOne man in his darkness, lying in his tomb\nWaiting for the silence to greet his final moon\nShadows start to gather, embracing his release\nA journey to the darkside, a forever rest in peace\nThere will be light if you believe\nJust let your memories flow free\nShow me light where only shadows breed\n...\n\n", 
        "A final departure - from this world we know\nA race lost in a dreamworld\nWe've reaped the seeds we've sown\nOne fatal error - of the human race\nWe're burning our candles\nAs we end up in flames\nThis is the final stage\nThe end of human race\nLets crawl back into our caves\nLet us arise, the sun sets dawn\nAnother era of life will be born\nWe'll end this story but we carry on - somewhere, somehow...\nLet us arise, the sun sets dawn\n...\n\n", 
        "So you think you are safe, and nothing can hurt you\nIt's all an illusion, created from lies\nMade yourself a safehouse, no one can get in\nBut you are the prisoner, in your imaginary world\nYou should take a look - at the concrete maze\nCause you'll die alone\nYou should take a look - at the concrete maze\nCause you'll die alone\nYes your loosing grip, though you never had control\nAnd now you're walking away...\n...\n\n", 
        "Take a sip of this my friend\na little grey water won\u00b4t hurt\nA sample of your own mistakes\nthe more destruction, the higher the stakes\n\nClimb down from your pediestal\nif you can\u00b4t show us how to act\n...\n\n", 
        "Maybe I'm broken\nMaybe I'm wrong\nI could've spoken sooner than I should have\nOnly the good die old\nThat's what they told me\nBut I don't know\nMaybe I'm breaking up with myself\nMaybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the things that I've been told\nWait for the colors to turn to gold\n\nDo you know?\nDo you know?\nYou're all I know\nYou're all I know\nWhen everything\nComes crashing down\nYou're all I know\nYou're all I know\n\nI'm ready for the fall\nI'm ready for everything that I believed in to drift away\nReady for the leaves\nReady for the colors to burn to gold\nAnd crumble away\n\nMaybe I'm destined to be distraught\nAlways a reason\nBreaking me down to my knees in the dead of night\nI keep on praying to see the light\nMaybe I'm breaking up with myself\nMaybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the things that I've been told\nWait for the colors to turn to gold\n\nDo you know?\nDo you know?\nYou're all I know\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't hear a sound of the world above\nAbove the ground I lie underneath it all\nSo damn sick of everything, sick of loosing grip\nI choose to lose control - one last time\nGoodbye, farewell - you know where you can find me\nTaking control...\nTaking control...\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm here tonight with a will to find\nExtracting the moments to live\nWhat no one knows, cause they're never told\nWe're empty til' the day we die\nSkip a breath and figure out the rest\nYou're one of the billions to go\nExtract your heart, cause it's fragile art\nIt's time to make peace with your fears\nTake all the blows, don't regret a thing\nOur anthem will be sung out loud\nTake all the blows, don't regret a thing\nTake all the blows, don't regret a thing\n...\n\n", 
        "Have you ever felt the scars\nTouched the wounds of a slaughtered heart?\nI greet you to my world, come join me, I hope you'll learn\nAs your emotions burn\nThere's nothing more to say, don't walk my path, just turn away\nSo wipe that smile my friend, this is my life in vain\nIn a race towards time\nI'd drink the world to drown the pain living in me\n...\n\n", 
        "Am I mentally weak?\nAs the masses, acting like rats\nAnd now killing eachother\nAnd it feels like they deserve it\nDenied all the lies so far\nBegging for the fall\nThe smiling plague that we are\nDon't think it doesn't suite you, just follow\n...\n\n", 
        "Now watch!\nThe grand deliverance opens up like cuts in the skin\nIt'll show the roads and take you where\nyou've never been returning and burning\nFeel the barriers explode from the barrel of aggression\nIt's time to reload\nThis organic ammo moves faster than these eyes can see\nThose bullets kill the distance in just as fast as speed can be\nReturning and burning\nFeel the barriers explode\nFrom the barrel of aggression\nIt's time to reload\nBlack - the ace of shades\nStrikes through the veins of the lame\nThe face of the target is selfdestruction and its tongue speaks your name\n\nDeliverance - The soul explodes\n...\n\n",

        "Case closed, end of story\nI'll silence you even before you start\nI'll draw the line and make it thick\nMake it so thick that all can see\nI'll modify a brand new line\nFor you to cross, you won't survive\nCan't kill the speed, a vicious being\nForget utility, this is all about me\nI've bled for what I've said\nBut I had to let it out\nCan't keep my mouth shut\nI've bled for what I've said\n...\n\n", 
        "A man can't foresee it, his own destiny is written\nAll guessing is useless, just to do what you have to, to get by\nAnother road taken, another bridge is going to fall\nToo many dices, thrown for the sake of his own\nExplorations ended, opportunities lost along the way\nRelationships lying dead\nExplorations ended, opportunities lost along the way\nRelationships lying dead\nStrive - to have nothing done right\nTo have nothing to live for\nTo have only existed, and you call it life\nStrive - to have nothing done right\nNothing to hang on to\n...\n\n", 
        "I hid my horns from all mankind just to stir up their lives\nTook them to the ledge and watched it all go down in flames\nThey lasted longer and somewhat stronger than I thought they would\nThey couldn't see what I am, now they can't deny\nSpeeded up the process, seemed to work so well\nSome days it went so slow\nLike it went in slowmotion, like watching metal corrode\nI would not speak about all things\nI had in store for you\nI would not speak about all things\n...\n\n", 
        "An empty stare, a stupid grin\nSweating palms and cold within\nDelete past calculations, adapt to a brand new breed\nSudden movements, the smell of caffeine\nWon't ever see me turning the other cheek, tooth for a tooth, I want more than you lies\nWon't ever see me walking away, not forgiving, I won't admit that I'm wrong\nCan't rid the disease, a need of release, the source will pull you under\n...\n\n",

        "Mute all your opinions, don't you ever take a stand, still thinking won't suit you\nAs I said once before, stand in the row\nWait in the silence, let the brainwash begin\nForget your morals, don't think of what is right\nThey'll do all the thinking for you, your future is planned\nCan't shoot yourself in the head, I'll pull the trigger for you\nToo weak to make this simple task, nothing more than a useless attempt, to do something right\nI'll help you trough\nDon't utter a single word, this is what you deserve, don't ever talk back\nDon't utter a single word, this is what you deserve, buried under laws just made for you\nDon't utter a single word, this is what you deserve, don't ever resist\n...\n\n", 
        "I hope you creep, I hope you crawl, hope you're feeling weak\nSo now you're lost like never before, I am the end, the end of it all\nI feed on the weak, cause they're the easiest prey\nI lead them astray, mankind has always functioned this way\nSomethings you won't ever understand, still you want to be dead as I am\nAllthings are not to be understood, so you imitate as much as you can\nSomethings you won't ever understand, still you want to be dead\nBlocked all the roads that lead you, so you imitate as much as you can\n...\n\n", 
        "Skulls piled on concrete, executions made with ease\nTombs filled with sickness, an invader who won't take heed\nEvolving with a shotgun, launching killing spree\nUnleashing death on mankind, excluding not a soul free\nHe won't be satisfied\nA gallery of death art, primitive actions to be seen\nCeiling dripping from their blood, loves to watch them creep\n...\n\n"
