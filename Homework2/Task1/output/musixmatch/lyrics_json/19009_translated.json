    "19009": [
        "(Benjamin Biolay) adaptation anglaise Keren Ann Zeidel\n\nAs the hour passes by, I pass the hours and I sigh\nFor the wakeup of the dawn, for those I love and those I mourn\nFor in silence and in vain, through the days of heavy rain\nFor ones I left under the sun before the wonder years begun\nAnd in the torrent of the fall, I will remember most of all.\nHow the tunnel of the spring brought your lips upon my skin\n...\n\n"
