        "There's no sense, the fire burns\nWhen wisdom fails, it changes all\nThe wheel embodies all that keeps on turning\n\nBlood red skies, I feel so cold\nNo innocence\nWe play our roll\nThe wheel embodies all\nWhere are we going?\n\nAll in all\nYou expect the wise to be wiser\nFallen from grace and\nAll and all I guess we should have known\nBetter 'cause\n\nWhat about us\nIsn't it enough\nNo we're not in paradise\nThis is who we are\nThis is what we've got\nNo it's not our paradise\nBut it's all we want\nAnd it's all that we're fighting for\nThought it's not paradise\n\nYou and us, or I and them\nThere comes a time to take a stand\nThe wheel is watching all\nIt keeps on burning\n...\n\n", 
        "Put all your angels on the edge\nKeep all the roses, I'm not dead\nI left a thorn under your bed\nI'm never gone...\nGo tell the world I'm still around\nI didn't fly, I'm coming down\nYou are the wind, the only sound\nWhisper to my heart\nWhen hope is torn apart\nAnd no one can save you\nI walk alone\nEvery step I take\nI walk alone\nMy winter storm\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm the one who leaves shadows\nIn your room at night\nI'm the reason you're listening\nEnlightening your eyes\n\nWhen Pan meets Apollo\nDown with the sin\nThey will send tears of angels\nThough kindness won't win\n\nLost Northern star\nBuried in sorrow\nI'll guard your mind\nLet demons howl outside\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I see the waves of sand\nBig free, another land\nDreams within dreams, you are alive\nThey gave me their wings, I spread them wide\n\nI'll move on to another place\n...\n\n", 
        "Gracefully, she's circling higher\nShe has the wind beneath her wings\nAnd looks down on us\nShe said\n\nRobbed of my innocence\nHad no more time to play\nI sure got my feathers burned\nBut I'm stronger than the flames\n\nHere she comes, here she comes\nI've been waiting for so long\nHere she comes, rose again from the flames\nMy little phoenix\n...\n\n", 
        "Open up the night\nLed by just a feeling\nAll around is light\nEverything is healing\n\nNo more fate and no more mystery\nEven as time falls away\nI live my days\nEvery moment and its memory\nNot only to survive\nTo die alive\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The streets are empty, inside it's warm\nHis hands are shaking, they locked the door\nA voice is calling asking to get in\n\nAll he wanted was a toy\nAll he needed was a gentle heart\nTo lead him through the dark\nWhen his dreams are running wild\n\nBoy and the ghost, fire's not burning\nThe lights went out, the lights went out\n\nBig family dinner, the untold tale\nTheir eyes are sparkling on his frozen face\nAngel's calling asking to get in\n...\n\n", 
        "It's getting hard to breathe\nDarkness in my head frightens me\nThere's a little devil in my mouth\nWriting ugly words for you to shout\nThe virgin soul that lived in me\nIs raped by insecurity\nI need you to sing\n\nSing for me my love\nSing the right from wrong\nHere inside my mind\n...\n\n", 
        "When maas&#39; is acquired and lakes frozen and the eye goes out of the sun when the swallow is a long walk from the forest and the desert lauluton, visit the warm breath of the winter season, when Christmas is when Christmas is ...", 
        "I do not seek power, grandeur, I do not need gold else; I ask the light and peace of heaven on earth! It&#39;s Christmas willing, brings joy and minds to the God! Not power, neither gold but peace to the land! ...",
