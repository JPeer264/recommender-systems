        "Authors & composers: norell/oson/bard\n\nIt's a friday night\nWe're on the road again\nAnother town another scene\nAnother audience\nBut you're not here with me\nI keep on calling you\n\nWhen i'm standing in the spotlight\nWhat am i to do\nI'm losing my mind without you\n\nChorus\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When I saw you standing there\n\nI about fell out my chair\nAnd when you moved your mouth to speak\nI felt the blood go to my feet\nNow it took time for me to know\n\nWhat you tried so not to show\n...\n\n", 
        "Authors & Composers: Thomas G: son & Henrik Sethsson\n\nI wanna know\nWhat you feel inside\nIs something wrong\nWhy did you leave last night\nIs it all just a game\nOh, tell me why we can't be lovers\n\nI do believe\nIn the two of us\nThat you and me\nWe are the only ones\nAnd we were meant to be true\nSo, tell me why we can't be lovers\n\nHow could I be such a fool\n...\n\n", 
        "There isn't much I haven't shared\nWith you along the road\nAnd through it all there'd always be\nTomorrow's episode\nSuddenly that isn't true\nThere's another avenue\nBeckoning, the great divide\nAsk no questions, take no side\nWho's to say who's right or wrong\nWhose course is braver run\nWill ever be, ask one\n...\n\n", 
        "Wake up in the morning straight to the sunshine\nListen to the radio - my favourite song\nTrying to find one certain book with an attitude\n'Cause there are things which are just like you do wish,\nAfter all\n\nCome on baby please please turn it on\n'Cause radio plays our favourite song\nOh, DJ, play that on and on\nI wonder what I feel (I feel)\n...\n\n",
