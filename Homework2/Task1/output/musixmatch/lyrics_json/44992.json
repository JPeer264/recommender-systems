        "I can't believe it's been a year\nSince I kissed my fears\nOn their salty lips\nAnd said to them I love you all\n\nI carried the weight of the world on my shoulders\nFor 20 years and look at me now\n\nI've got something to say\nAbout the last 12 months I've lived\nI'm not the same kid I was when I was younger\nI just thought you should know\nI take a pill every day\nto help me deal with life\n\nAnd oh my God, I've lost control\nI stare at accidents in a sick attempt\nTo feel at all\n\nI carried the weight of the world on my shoulders\nFor 20 years and look at me now\n\nI've got something to say\nAbout the family that I've lost\nI hope my mother and my father think\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't lie\nI love you all\nI do\nAnd to all of you guessing\nJust tell that I'm betting to stall\nIt's true\n\nWe will capture you in open arms\nWhen you're tired and alone\n\nMy life is better than it ever was\nMy life is better than it ever was\n\nAnd I'll give blood to your dry veins\nWe do this for the passion and not the fashion or fame\n...\n\n", 
        "This island has become an ocean\nAnd my boat's too small\nThe waves are crashing in\nAnd I can't save this sinking ship\n\nI sent out signal flares\nBut no one out there seems to care\nNow the voice inside my head\nIs the only thing that I have left\n\nThis is the part where I'll admit\nI'm getting what I deserve.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I was the chapstick in your purse, to keep you smooth\nI was the finger in your throat, to keep you cute\nMy liver hates you for walking out on us\nMy kidney's drowning in a pool of a long lost love\n\nI stole your perfume to spray in my room\nYou will always be here\n\nSo much for the past year\nI poured it down the drain with all the alcohol and pain I got from\nYour Eyes, oh your eyes\nI'm burning out my bedside\nAnd I'm rotting out my insides slowly\n\nI was the hand that held your hair back from your face\nNow I must forget the way you taste\n...\n\n",

Goodbye you friend.\nYou were so young. You were so young.\nGoodbye Steven. Goodbye you friend.\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I had a dream last night\nAnd in my dream I took a knife to you\nI slit your throat from ear to ear\nThe wound was gasping for the air\nYour scream so clear\n\nBut every dream could never come true\nOnly in my sick mind can I do these things to you\n\nWith every passing moment\nIt just keeps getting worse\nThe walls are getting smaller\nAnd I am six feet beneath the earth\nAnd I will be, oh I will be, just lost\n\nI had a dream last night\nAnd in my dream I robbed a country club\nA 5 year old tried to stop me\nBut I shot him through the head\nAnd now he's dead\n\nBut every dream could never come true\nOnly in my sick mind can I do these things to you\n...\n\n", 
        "Life, is floating fast away.\nBut I look, your head is turned away.\n\nFrom the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.\nBut the feeling inside has kept me up all night.\n\nYou and me are like one heart-beat.\nYou and me are like one heart-beat.\n...\n\n", 
        "Is this what it's like?\nA dream lacking serenity?\nA wordless conversation, a \"you and i\" without a me.\n\nWell I try and i won't get far,\ni'll die and i won't get far\ni'll try and know that everything's ok\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Just throw it back, for one more night\nOn a starlit and moon-struck night.\nThe ground did fold and eat us both\nBut all my love, I did devote.\n\nBeneath the rafters the angels sing\nSpinning violence and playing with my heart.\n\nThe song I wrote, it was for you (was for you)\nTo live inside of me, I'm dying inside you.\n(x2)\n\nLost inside another crash\n...\n\n", 
        "It's so nice sitting very still\nIn a room where no one else can feel\nThe pain that breaks my heart each day\nI'm not okay\n\nSunlight shining through my window\nLet's me know that I'm still alive\nWhy did I ever let you inside my heart?\nI'm such a fool\n\nWell paint my face in shades of blood and gray\nAnd take a seat right next to me\nBut I should've known that you were a killer\nBut now I'm dead\n\nA gaping hole, shot through my heart\nA lost connection from your poison dart\n...\n\n"
