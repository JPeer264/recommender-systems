        "Everything goes slipping away\nIn your eyes, I see the day\nEverything begins to fade\nwhat you say, slipping slipping away\n\nSomebody take my hand\nAnd make me understand\nHere in the light of day\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Looking for a reason\nNot to say goodbye\nEverything is lasting\nFor a while\n\nSo you try manipulation\nWhen the truth wont get you there\nSo you think in speculation\nWhat you did was almost fair\n\nNow I'm walking my own way\nBeen this way before\nNow I'm leading my own life\nOpened up the door\nTime is waiting you know that, well, I know you wanted more\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
