        "Over the top of a lager in wineless wine bar\nI can see the sunset over Blackbird hill\nIt's only the cocaine comaradarie\nKeeping the thugs from moving in for the kill\nFriends desert me through choice and pressure\nI know the faces but I'm not safe\nA kiss torn curl blows through your hair\n...\n\n", 
        "You said it, you meant it\nNow it is too late to take it back\nYou can't leave it, you can't forget it\n...\n\n", 
        "I still remember the first time every kiss you steal Embraced at sunset With dreams always skin deep still remember that song was an anthem for the two Whenever something goes wrong it is enough to re-hear never, never, never Jamas I said goodbye Even I carry everywhere I go like a tattoo within the heart no, no, no, no, no ...", 
        "Each day I walk along this lonely street\nTrying to find, find a future\nNew pair of shoes are on my feet\nCos' fashion is my only culture\n\nNothing ever change, oh no...\nNothing ever change\n\nPeople say to me just be yourself\nIt makes no sense to follow fashion\nHow could I be anybody else\nI don't try, I've got no reason\n\nNothing ever change, oh no...\n...\n\n", 
        "You can say whatever you like I'm not listening anymore\nIt makes no odds whatever you say I'm not listening anyway\nYou can scream until you are blue in the face\nI'm not listening anymore\nSo don't bother - save your breath - I'm not listening anymore\n\nJUST SHUT UP!\n...\n\n"
