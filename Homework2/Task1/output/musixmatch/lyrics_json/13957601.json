        "We took the train on Sundays\nWe climbed the highest mountains\nIt's like we've seen every part of the planet.\n\nI said I'd bring you everywhere\nSeems like I kept my promise\nThat's what you deserve, my friend.\n\nWe drew our names in the snow\nCrossed oceans on a sailboat\nWe were two kids that\n...\n\n", 
        "Will you come along\nCause I'm about to leave this town\nIn my eyes, a waterfall,\nAll I can hear, a siren call\nCould you be waiting by the shore,\nOh I could drown without you\nWould you be holding out the line when I fall?\nI'll never let you down Never let you down x3\n...\n\n", 
        "Deep in the ocean, dead and cast away\nWhere innocences burn in flames\nA million mile from home, I'm walking ahead\nI'm frozen to the bones, I am\n\nA soldier on my own, I don't know the way\nI'm riding up the heights of shame\nI'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest\n...\n\n", 
        "Buying some vintage records in Williamsberg stores\nPlaying paper boats on east river shores\nMeeting mermaids and lobsters in Coney Island\nPuking our deep fried Oreos in Astroland\nSpending our days watching skylines from rooftops\nOn independance day, Manhattan fireworks\nLife is easier where the walls are red\nBrooklyn is a place stuck in my head\n...\n\n", 
        "What are the words that I'm supposed to say?\nYour white skin, swirling fireflies.\nDarkness has surrounded Baltimore bay.\nWhy don't you open your blue eyes?\nAre they things that water can't wash away?\nHow can your absence leave no trace?\nAs I let you sink in Baltimore bay.\n...\n\n", 
        "Most of my sweet memories were buried in the sand\nThe fire and the pain will now be coming to an end\nHow did you get to save me from this desolate wasteland\nIn your eyes I see the dawn of brighter days again.\n\nWith my tears you washed away the mud stuck on my hands\n...\n\n", 
        "Deep in the ocean, dead and cast away\nWhere innocence is burned in flames\nA million mile from home, I'm walking ahead\nI'm frozen to the bones, I am...\n\nA soldier on my own, I don't know the way\nI'm riding up the heights of shame\nI'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest\n...\n\n",
