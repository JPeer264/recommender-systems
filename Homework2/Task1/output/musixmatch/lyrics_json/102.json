        "We made it\nWe made it\n\nThe devil, the haters, the bloggers, the papers, the labels, they labeled me\nBut they can't relate to our struggle, my nigga, we came up from slavery\nApologies go out to all of my fans cause they waited so patiently\nThis one is for all of the lost and forgotten black angels that prayed for me\nA milli, a milli, niggas love me cause I'm ill\nThe greatest story ever told, niggas in the field\nFrom Solomon to Sambo to Django, it's fact\nI'm the Farrakhan of rap and I get it from the wheel\nThe son of WD, who hung around in the D\nWho ran around in the three\nThe trap gods raised me\nFace all on the Sphinx\nStory all in the wall of the pyramids\nNiggas know the Black God saved me\nYou can blow the nose off, that won't change it\nObamacare won't heal all that anguish\nWe came a long way from the bottom of the boat\nAll praise to the Mahdi, we found our language\nGold necklace, middle finger erected\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",

Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n\nTears on the mausoleum floor\nBlood stains the Colosseum doors\nLies on the lips of a priest\nThanksgiving disguised as a feast\nRolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche\nOnly the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police\nCocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached\nDrug dealer chic, I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach\nIs Pious pious cause God loves pious?\nSocrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",
