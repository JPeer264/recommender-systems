        "Well, I woke up this morning without you.\nDon't ask me how but I go t through.\nThe floor of this room I've been pacing;\nTrying to drown out the sound my heart is making:\nIt's calling for you.\nOh, we said: \"It looks like we won't make it.\n\"You hurt me, I hurt you, and we can't take it.\"\nSo we fixed it, we thought, just by leaving,\nBut the heart, it's too wise for deceiving.\nIt's calling for you.\nOh, oh, oh.\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Far away I've traveled,\nTo stand once more alone.\nAnd hear my memories echo,\nThrough these hills that I call home.\n\nAs a child I roamed this valley.\nI watched the seasons come and go.\nI spent many hours dreaming,\nOn these hills that I call home.\n...\n\n", 
        "Riding east-bound freight train, stealing through the night\nHe was just a lonesome hobo who was fighting for his life\nThe sadness in his eyes revealed the torture of his soul\nas he raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold\n\nOutside the rain is falling on that lonely boxcar door,\nbut the little frame of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor\nAs the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside\n...\n\n", 
        "Troublesome waters, much blacker than night,\nAre hiding from view, the harbour's bright light.\nTossed on the turmoil of life's troubled sea,\nI cried to my Saviour: \"Have mercy on me.\"\n\nThen gently I'm feeling the touch of his hand,\nGuiding my boat in safely to land.\nLeading the way to heaven's bright shore,\nWhere troublesome waters I'm fearing no more.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Fireflies inside of a mason jar.\nActing big behind the wheel of daddy's car.\nPlaying church around the old piano stand,\nYou were quite a preacher and oh, we sang so grand.\nI remember every night what we would say and do:\n\"If you've forgiven me, then I've forgiven you.\"\nAnd now when life begins to get the best of me,\nI reminisce these childhood memories.\n\nWe built a raft and traveled all around the world,\nAnd stopped for penny candy at the corner store.\n...\n\n", 
        "Everybody's wonderin' what and where they all came from\nEverybody's worryin' 'bout where they're gonna go\nWhen the whole thing's done\nBut no one knows for certain\n\nAnd so it's all the same to me\nI think I'll just let the mystery be\nSome say once you're gone you're gone forever\nAnd some say you're gonna come back\n\nSome say you rest in the arms of the Saviour\nIf in sinful ways you lack\nSome say that they're comin' back in a garden\n...\n\n", 
        "Far away I've traveled,\nTo stand once more alone.\nAnd hear my memories echo,\nThrough these hills that I call home.\n\nAs a child I roamed this valley.\nI watched the seasons come and go.\nI spent many hours dreaming,\nOn these hills that I call home.\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, I've heard them say there's one for everybody\nAnd I just knew somehow that you'd be the one for me\n'Cause making love with you's not just a hobby\nNo, it's the flame that burnt the forest down in me\n\nAnd darling was it day or was it nighttime\nWere them whippoorwills a-moaning through the trees,\nThrough the trees\nI don't remember just what you said\nBut ooh, right from the start\n...\n\n", 
        "Look at you, look at me.\nMy heart breaks as I read our sad story.\n\nNever thought that I'd be,\nHere with you wishing I was free.\nI never dreamed today would come,\nWhen love was young.\n\nThere was nothing I would not do,\nFor the chance to see your face.\nHow could I have known back then,\nThat today I'd hesitate.\n\nWhen you hold me in your arms,\n...\n\n", 
        "And you know the sun's settin' fast,\nAnd just like they say, nothing good ever lasts.\nWell, go on now and kiss it goodbye,\nBut hold on to your lover,\n'Cause your heart's bound to die.\nGo on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town.\nCan't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town,\nGoodnight.\n\nUp the street beside that red neon light,\nThat's where I met my baby on one hot summer night.\nHe was the tender and I ordered a beer,\nIt's been forty years and I'm still sitting here.\n\nBut you know the sun's settin' fast,\nAnd just like they say, nothing good ever lasts.\nWell, go on now and kiss it goodbye,\nBut hold on to your lover,\n'Cause your heart's bound to die.\nGo on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town.\nCan't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town,\nGoodnight.\n...\n\n", 
        "Twelve-hundred miles, it's length and breadth\nThat four-square city stands\nIt's gem-set walls of jasper shine\nThey're not made by human hands\n\nOne-hundred miles, it's gates are wide\nAbundant entrance there\nWith fifty miles of elbow room\nOn either side to spare\n\nWhen the gates swing wide on the other side\nJust beyond the sunset sea\nThere'll be room to spare as we enter there\n...\n\n", 
        "Last night before I went to sleep,\nMy knees dropped to the floor.\nI turned me eyes up to the sky,\nAnd I prayed: \"Please help me, Lord.\n\"You know I've sowed my wild oats,\n\"And now the fun's all gone.\"\nAnd then I heard these tender words,\nAnd I put them in my song:\n\n\"Infamous Angel, come on home,\n\"To someone who loves you,\n\"And knows you needed to roam.\n\"Grab your things, a ticket's waiting,\n\"At the bus depot:\n\"For: 'Infamous Angel, Destination: Home'.\"\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me.\nWhen you hold me close,\nAnd you say: \"That's all over.\"\nYou don't go looking back,\nYou don't hold the cards to stack.\n'Cause you mean what you say.\n\nSweet forgiveness, you help me see.\n...\n\n", 
        "There'll be laughter even after you're gone\nI'll find reasons to face that empty dawn\n'Cause I've memorized each line in your face\nAnd not even death can ever erase\nThe story they tell to me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She grew up plain and simple in a farming town\nHer daddy played the fiddle and use to do the calling when they had hoedowns\nShe said the neighbors would come\nand they'd move all my grandma's furniture 'round\nand there'd be twenty or more there on the old wooden floor\ndancing to a country sound\n\nThe Carters and Jimmy Rodgers played her favourite songs\nand on Saturday nights there was a radio show\nand she would sing along\nand I'll never forget her face when she revealed to me\nthat she'd dreamed about singing at The Grand Ol' Opry\n\nHer eyes, oh how they sparkled when she sang those songs\n...\n\n",
