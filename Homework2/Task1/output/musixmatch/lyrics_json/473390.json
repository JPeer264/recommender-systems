        "Can you show me what it's like to be alive?*\nMy lord knows that I've been sinking.\nThe sanctuary's skin has finally been lifted.\nThe symphony has grown silent with distaste\nfrom the grime its sound produces and its elegance in waste.\nI've grown blind to my eyelids they are the my guardians of naught.\nThe sight my innards seek to dispatch is the very reason I am wrong.\nCall upon the almighty one for He is the only one who saves.\nCall upon the almighty one, protector of the graves.\nAll you've said is now forsaken.\nWhat you've come to believe is forsaken.\nAs the wretches of this pit of heart cry we will all know what is indeed\nForsaken.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "\"I burned in the Garden of Paradise!\"\n\nA lifetime of disbelief is now shackled by its throat.\nFor he never turned unto the gates but burned it down with earth.\nHe ingests his wealth, contemplates the drain, his emerald soul.\nHis grave will sleep warm of opulent eyeballs.\n\nAnd at the summoning grounds is the reunion where abundance is abound.\nBroken teeth are found in the bones and backs beyond the flesh of animals.\nThe price on life had begun to substitute.\nBroken teeth are found in the bones and backs beyond the flesh of animals.\nAnd so began: A filthy addiction.\nThe price on life had begun to substitute.\nThus he verbalized for every sad inhuman worth.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "God give me strength, you know I need it.\nSay \"Submit to me!\" And I'll concede.\nAnd when the crow rusts, water will follow in combust.\nThe veins of pride pump strong with the the blood of scarecrows.\nA cavity so fills, a likened tar is the stain of poisoned arrows.\n\nStraight through the soul of man.\nGod remind these people of what they're in.\n\nGod give me strength you know I need it.\n\nPray for mercy.\nSo beg the pedestal to shine between each shoulder blade\nand slip a card of arrogant remains.\nThe mark of a titan bore silver, belted, strained the neck\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Come crumbling as the shattering of faith\nHe who cannot stand for his Lord will sleep forever without wake.\n\nAnd among us are the faithless who long only for the glory of this world.\nAmong us are faithless but I am not of them\nfor I long only to die in His arms.\n\nIn the eyes of God I am His testament.\n\nThe wool is warm with comfort but this is coated in deception\nfor the sheep will soon be stripped and it will freeze without protection.\nBare blooded and ripe for failure.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Open your eyes!\n\nIn spite of these creations a venom settles in the blood\nwith fangs that will not rest til they've engulfed\neverything, the sky and humans all alike.\nDispersing vile scripture as abundant as the night.\nThis poison takes but a single drop to thrive.\n\nThe vipers waltz in time to slay the conscience back to blind.\nSlowly digesting and conspiring with mortal threads.\nThis evil's woven firm its lies into our heads.\nA single cry will silence all but a single pierce will bring to fall\ndespite all odds we must confront\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Dearly beguiled, we're gathered to commemorate\nthis blessing that became the greatest of mistakes.\nThe sword soul and flesh have since then become one.\nThis impasse has become the single source for slandered tongue.\n\nNow we are being slowly erased with what we were made.\nThis impasse will trickle flames and offer us a testing taste.\nNow this is what they had spoken of.\nBut when the sun gives out we rise.\nThis is our forthcoming.\nWe rise.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "We're always searching for the answer be it disclosed in lion's heart.\nHe smiles as the claimer of freshly driven carnal parts.\nThis bastard has but stolen the skin of sheep for selfish will.\nTemptation's in his whisper as he lightly hums what only kills.\nHe is the prince of all filth, wearing the earth as a throne.\nHe is the prince of all filth, crumbling for a crown of frozen thorns.\n\nAnd so the ancients hath sworn his name,\nbidding the earth and printing the idol graves.\nHe brings the end, a warning that will bring us in so we can all watch ourselves die.\nSo listen to it rot.\nWhy are the children bathing in his scales\nchanting serpent names?\nBroken porcelain glides along the marble floors.\nIdol eyes will never turn back to their Lord.\nThey dance in his coils and chant...\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Lo and behold!\n\nThey preach servility, the conformed way of breathing.\n(They speak in the same tongues everyday.)\nBetwixt fear I smelt a carcass bathed of sin.\nThe carrion swarm will love us for this one.\nOur only curse is the disgusting rotting urge.\nTo feed our ears with the devils piss.\nLoyal and servile we kneel before his fallen throne.\nLet us try recite once, before we rot and burn.\n\nMaster almighty, my light, separate my sinful spine.\n\"Bow your heads, to the sound of creation. To the giver and taker of life.\"\n\nSwallow the sand and let it drown your insides.\nThis must be cleansing.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Brace yourself. The towers arch over our heads.\nThe signs inching down our necks carve the path of our existence.\nNo obelus could be printed in the temple walls.\nPerfection to the micrometer and no pillar could ever fall.\nBrace yourself. The sky is a dance of culling blades.\nEncircle as knifehand prays to incise before ascending.\n\nSurely the sea had been split\nand from its middle ground rose a serpent from a stick.\nWe have regressed with every step we grow much closer\nbut now we tear the horns and beg the books will end the torture.\n\nHe who kneels before his Lord is saved.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
