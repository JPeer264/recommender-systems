        "Imagine there's no heaven\nIt's easy if you try\nNo hell below us\nAbove us only sky\nImagine all the people living for today\n\nImagine there's no countries\nIt isn't hard to do\nNothing to kill or die for\n...\n\n", 
        "You know, every time I look in the mirror I see my Dad\nI think that's why this song means so much to me\n\nWhen I was young\nMy dad would say\n\"C'mon son, let's go out and play\"\nSometimes it seems like yesterday\n\nAnd I'd climb up the closet shelf\nWhen I was all by myself\nGrab his hat and fix the brim\nPretending I was him\n...\n\n"
