And will she cry all day?\nAnd will she cry all night? Just for the one who went away?\nOut on the moor shes waiting for him\nShes like a wolf under the moon.\nAnd I am sighing here beside him.\nHes right behind me lying spoons.\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me turn off your TV.\nBefore you go crazy.\nCome out for a while with me.\nNo dont be lazy?\nTall trees whose shadows fall along sheeps meadow.\n...\n\n"
