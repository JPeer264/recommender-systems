        "Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park\nI wanna hold you in the dark\nOne last time\nJust one last time\n\nAnd oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?\nCan you guess that I'll be gone?\nWith the twilight\nWith the twilight\n\nBut no flame burns forever, oh no\nYou and I both know this all too well\nAnd most don't even last the night\nNo they don't, they say they don't\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You may call it in this evening\nBut you've only lost the night\nPresent all your pretty feelings\nMay they comfort you tonight\nAnd I'm climbing over something\nAnd I'm running through these walls\n\nI don't even know if I believe\nI don't even know if I believe\nI don't even know if I believe\nEverything you're trying to say to me\n\nI had the strangest feeling\nYour world's not all it seems\nSo tired of misconceiving\n...\n\n", 
        "Wide eyed, with a heart made full of fright\nYour eyes follow like traces in the night\nThe tightrope, that you wander everytime\nyou have been weighed\nyou have been found wanting\n\nBeen wondering for days\nhow you felt me slip your mind\nleave behind your wanton ways\n\nI wanna learn to love in kind\n\n'Cause you were all I ever longed for\n...\n\n", 
        "It's in my blood, it's in my water\nYou tried to taint me\nTaint me from the start\n\nWith that deadness in your eye\nFlash your flesh\nDesperate for a need to rise\n\nWith a silver crystal lung\nHow will you use to know how to shine?\nIn a place that's safe from heart\nBut I had been blessed with a wilder mind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell my thoughts to resign\nAnd lift you from my mind\nI'm not ready, I'm not strong enough\nTo cradle the weight of your love\n\nJust take a minute, take a breath\nLay down your head on my sunken chest\nI saw a flicker, then just smoke\nBut as you left I was calling your name at the night\n\nThought we were done\nYoung love will keep us young\n...\n\n", 
        "So we were up\nThrowin' dice in the dark\nI saw you late, last night, come to harm\nI saw you dance in the devil's arms\n\nThe night kept coming\nReally nothing I could do\nEyes with a fire, unquenched, by peace\nCurse the beauty, curse the queen\n\nSo we come\n...\n\n", 
        "You hold it in your hands\nLet it flow this cruelty\nOf youth as you fall again, alone\nIn the compromise of truth\n\nIt's in the eyes\nI can tell you will always be danger\nWe had it tonight\n\nWhy do you leave it open?\nAnd the stakes\nRemain too high\nFor this silent mind\n...\n\n", 
        "Broad-shouldered beasts fill the sky\nManhattan beams at the night\nBut you are wrapped up in white\nCurled up in fright\n\nSo I took you to the city for the night\nTo dance under dizzying silver light\nAnd for a moment you were wild\nWith a? like a child\nJust a moment\n\nBut wasn't it you who said I was not free?\nAnd wasn't it you who said I needed peace?\nAnd now it's you who's flawed by fear of it all and it's alright\nTake it out on me\n...\n\n", 
        "Weekend records take the streets\nWe're the bandit in their eye\nBut in our bedroom we're bloodshot and beat\nAnd never so alive\n\nBut I know what's on your mind\nGod knows I put it there\nBut if I took it back\nWe'd be nowhere\n...\n\n", 
        "And in time\nthis one reminds the other of a past\nA life lived much too fast to hold onto\nHow am I losing you?\nA broken house, another dry month waiting for the rain\nAnd I have been resisting this decay\nI thought you'd do the same\n\nBut this is all I ever was\nand this is all you came across\nthose years ago\nNow you go too far\nDon't tell me that I've changed\nbecause that's not the truth\nand now I'm losing you\n\nFragile sound, the world outside\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I came home\nLike a stone\nAnd I fell heavy into your arms\nThese days of dust\nWhich we've known\nWill blow away with this new sun\n\nBut I'll kneel down wait for now\nAnd I'll kneel down\nKnow my ground\n\nAnd I will wait I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait I will wait for you\n\nSo break my step\nAnd relent\n...\n\n", 
        "Headed down south to the land of the pines\nAnd I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline\nStarin' up the road\nPray to God I see headlights\n\nI made it down the coast in seventeen hours\nPickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers\nAnd I'm a hopin' for Raleigh\nI can see my baby tonight\n\nSo rock me mama like a wagon wheel\nRock me mama any way you feel\nHey mama rock me\nRock me mama like the wind and the rain\nRock me mama like a south-bound train\nHey mama rock me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I ran away in floods of shame\nI'll never tell how close I came\nAs I crossed the Holland Road\n\nWhere you went left and I went right\nAs the moon hung proud and bright\nYou would have loved it here tonight\n\nSpin me 'round, just to pin me down\nOn the cover of this strange bed\nSpin me 'round, just to pin me down\n\nWrap up your questions, keep them down\nLet the water lead us home\nAnd I was sorry for what I'd done\n\nAnd you were young I was not old\n...\n\n", 
        "Give me hope in silence\nIt's easier; It's kinder\nTell me not of heartbreak\nIt plagues my soul, plagues my soul\nWe will meet back on this road\nNothing gaining, truth be told\nBut I am not the enemy\nit isn't me, the enemy\n\n...\n\n"
