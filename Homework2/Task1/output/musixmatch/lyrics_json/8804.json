        "Janganlah hanya mengukir janji\nSedangkan dikau masih mencari\nAdakah benar kata kata\nBukan ungkapan sementara\n\nKaulah pancaran yang daku rasa\nBagaikan obor yang menyinar\nJika terpadam tiba tiba\nSunyilah insan alam gelita\n\nJika kau selam hati ini\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted\nI thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted\nAnd even though your friends tell me you're doing fine\n\nAre you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?\nWhen he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?\n\nSometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?\nIf what we had was real, how could you be fine?\n\n'Cause I'm not fine at all\n\nI remember the day you told me you were leaving\nI remember the make-up running down your face\nAnd the dreams you left behind you didn't need them\nLike every single wish we ever made\nI wish that I could wake up with amnesia\nAnd forget about the stupid little things\nLike the way it felt to fall asleep next to you\nAnd the memories I never can escape\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
