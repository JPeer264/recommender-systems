        "Life fading time\nFeel like victim of now and my conscience\nHide lots of love\nAlways wanted but never given back?\nScared Dreams and miracles, thoughts and meanings\nForever wished away?\nHate Just a word? Just an answer or an indication on ignorance?\n\nIn his charming dreams\nHe dreams oblivious of reality\n(Awake) Just one lonely tear\nAfter dreaming all the truth again\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Romantic lakes in my dreams, shadows of the deep\nA night of thunder, the moonlight asleep\nMountains of doom are taking my disposal life\nThey reveal the place a teardrop cries\nThe voyage to eternity, straight to my star\nSends my power and my mind away so far\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Far away you fly\nYour soul is in the sky\nThere's nothing left that brings you back to me\nYou've reached out my mind\nYou've lost a painful fight\nNow follow him into the underworld\n\nI'm sad and down\nTears running down my face\nI miss your touch and the sweet taste of your lips\n\nI'm waiting every day but I know you'll never come\nForever your eyes will be closed\nThe endless fear has gone, after darkness comes the sun\nForever salvation has come\nForever you'll be gone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
