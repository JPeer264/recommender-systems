        "\"What's that noise? Turn it down!\" You're irritated by that beautiful rebel sound. I turn it up just to tune you out and you still don't understand what we're screaming about? Your eyes must be shut cause you still don't see it. Made up your mind that you won't believe it. We'll say it louder if you still don't hear it. You better run if you don't want to be near it. It's right outside your front door. Do you think I don't know what all those locks are for? And it's scratching at your window. Too close for comfort.\n\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
