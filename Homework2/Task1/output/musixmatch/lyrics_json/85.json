        "Well I'm driving on down to the subside bar\nThese days my old shovelhead should go travel far\nUp she goes went out walking, now I wanna be\nWell all the locals gonna give each other company\nWe'll drive and shove the pickups in the morning\nThen we'll ride the Harley Davidsons at night\nThey all work for somebody who makes all the money\nAmazed, I'm just a-loving you tight in the house of blue light, house of blue light\n\nWell I'm driving on down to meet a woman there\nShe got the long legs ramblin' there's the rollin' hair\nShe knows just what to do to make a man feel good\nShe's the hardest workin' woman in this neighborhood\nShe don't mind makin' breakfast in the morning\nShe don't mind makin' love every night\nShe said come see me honey and bring lots of money\n'Cause we know how to treat you right in the house of blue light\nHouse of blue light... House of blue light... House of blue light...\n\nYou know this life is filled with grief, sometimes it gets U so down\nYou got to find yourself some relief\nAnd get the roadhouse, we're right outta sight now, roadhouse of blue light\n\nWell I've been around the world and bitter times are low\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
