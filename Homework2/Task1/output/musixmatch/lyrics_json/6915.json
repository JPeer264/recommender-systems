        "Face down with the LA curbside ending, and the 1s and 0s\nDowntown was a perfect place to hide\nThe first star that I saw last night was a headlight of a man-made sky but\nman-made never made our dreams collide... collide\nHere we are now with a fallen sky and the rain\nwe're awakening\nHere we are now with a desprate youth and pain\nwe're awakening\nmaybe it's called ambition\nyou've been talkin' in your sleep about a dream\nwe're awakening\nLast week saw me living for nothing but deadlines\nwith my deadbeat sky but\nthis town doesn't look the same tonight\nthis dream started singing to me out of nowhere\n...\n\n", 
        "Life and love and why\nChild, adult, then die\nAll of your hoping\nAnd all of your searching\nFor what?\nAsk me for what am I living\nOr what gives me strength\nThat I'm willing to die for\n\nTake away from me\nThis monstrosity\n'Cause my futile thinking's\nNot gonna solve nothing tonight\nAsk me for what am I living\nOr what gives me strength\n...\n\n", 
        "Everything I know tell me she's everything\nThat I could hope for\nEverything I know tell me I can't let her walk away\n\nI took my time to find the words\nI hoped she'd feel the same\n\n'Cause I want someone to share my smile\nTo share the pain, to be there when the sea turns gray\nTo share the joy for better or worse\nAnd I thought that it might have been her\n...\n\n"
