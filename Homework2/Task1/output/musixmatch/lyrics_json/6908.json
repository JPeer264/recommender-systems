        "All you folks back home, I'll never tell you this\nYou're not supposed to know where your daughter is\nThere are ways of life you never understood\nIt's right here, downtown Hollywood\n\nIt's afternoon on Sunset Boulevard\nI've got a stolen moment trying hard\nTo write a kind of Christmas card\n\nBut I am burning out again\nTonight there is fever in my veins\n...\n\n", 
        "Must have been walking\nDon't know this place\nSomebody stopped talking\nIt is written in my face\n\nThought I'd never leave you\nThought I'd never dare\nBut I watched you going under\nThat's a thought I could not bear\n\nFive thousand miles I'm away from you\nDrifting by the Spanish steps tonight\nGuess you've got my number\nGuess you got my line\nGuess you got my number\nShould I be on your mind\n...\n\n", 
        "Half in love and half in hate\nSomeone told me it is late\nLate on earth he said, maybe\nlate in you\nAnd late in me\nDarker than it has to be\n\nTell me just another lie\nNow we're woven under ice\nTell me that there is no other\nI am a child\nBe my mother\nIf you lie, babe\n...\n\n", 
        "As you pour yourself a scotch\nCrush a roach or check your watch\nAs your hands adjust your tie people die\n\nIn the towns with funny names\nHit by bullets, caught in flames\nBy and large not knowing why people die\n\nAnd in small places you don't know of\nYet big for having no chance to scream\nOr say good-bye people die\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby\nAre you holding the key\nWas it you that put a lock on my door\nWho sent you\nAre you as deep as the sea\nWell it takes a deep womb\nTo shelter me\n\nI can hold you, girl\n...\n\n", 
        "You waited for me\nWhen I was strong\nYou never called\nYou waited long\nNow I come back\nTo sleep with you\nYou love me still\nI love you, too\n\nYou kept the house\nI could not keep\n...\n\n", 
        "Sandalwood trees are evergreen\nCut them down\nPlant coffee beans\nBuild no schools\nConstruct no roads\nMark them as fools\nLet ignorance rule\nLeave them stranded on their island\nTreat them to the tunes of silence\nRed is the cross that covers our shame\nEvery kingdom, every land\nHas its heart in the common man\nSilently the tide shifts the sand\n...\n\n", 
        "Lay me down tonight, I'm falling deep\nI'm tired, now I'll sleep\nSo close my eyes and take me in\nI'll leap into the night like wind\nI leave my body, leave my sword\nSo lay me own, Father Lord\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sleep my love, sleep\nOr look up at a sky\nreturning from its deep\nSee the moon go down\nWatch the sun come 'round\nTell me what you see\n\nSleep my love, sleep\nlook into a world\nYou can no longer reach\nTime's a one way track\nThere is no direction back\nmhm... when you're dreaming\nTell me what you see\nTell me what you see\n\noohoohoo tell me what you see\ntell me what you see\ntell me what you see\n...\n\n", 
        "Stay\nI say it as a friend\nHe can handle the daylight\nBut the night has its way\n\nTouch him\nLike on one did before\nNo fingerprints on the dew\nSo stay\nWhatever you do\n\n...\n\n",
