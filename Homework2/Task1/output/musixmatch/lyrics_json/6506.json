        "I know it's hard\nIn a world gone mad\nTo find the truth\nTo Understand\nAnd I know it's hard\nTo turn the page\nTo walk the line\nTo have the faith\nBut sometimes when it's light\nAnd you can't see\nSometimes when this world\nJust seems to be so cold\nSometimes when you're lost at sea\nDrowning in your pain\nSometimes the sun shines through the rain\nI know it's hard\nIn a world so cold\nTo feel the love\nI know it's hard\nAnd I know it's true\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
