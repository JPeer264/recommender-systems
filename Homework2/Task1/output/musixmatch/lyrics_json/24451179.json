        "Lying back to back at 10 to 1\nYou're awake, like me\nTrying to concieve that done is done\nYou made a mistake, I see\nBut I'm a little too tired, baby\nIt's a little too late\n\nTo bring it up\nIn the weary dark of night\nBetween black and white\nIs a thousand shades of gray\nI'm not giving up but I need a little light\nOh - save it for the break of day\nsave it for the break of day\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "There's nothing like doubt tearing your mind\nTo leave you muddled up and blind\nThere's nothing like fear riding your soul\nTo leave you stone cold\nThere's nothing like rain falling in the night\nFrom a vast hidden height\nFalling like tears from the dark sky's lonely eye\n\nThere's nothing like heat biting your skin\nTo let you boil from within\nThere's nothing like sweat dripping down your sides\nGleaming nights\nThere's nothing like flames licking in the air\nHungry, without a care\nLicking like tongues, here and there\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
