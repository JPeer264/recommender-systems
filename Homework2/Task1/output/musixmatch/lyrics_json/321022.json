        "See the skies hanging low\nUp upon walls the crumbling voice\nYou ask yourself what is this time\nAnd what's the meaning of being?\nYou ask yourself what is this time\nAnd what's the meaning of being?\n\nFollow the river at rail\nHigh hopes pierce our poor souls\nLike the disaster follows another\n...\n\n", 
        "Feel it rush in your brain\nLike lightning breaks the sky\nStand alone and die raising arms\n\nWishing you could stop\nWishing you could stop\nWishing you could stop\nWishing\n\nI bet you ain't never ended\nYour day way like this\nI bet you ain't never ended\nYour day way like this\n\nCabin fever - raising voice\nCabin fever - raising voice\n...\n\n", 
        "Who's there to lie to for a little more\nGot so evil, how could this happen\nLiving shell of a human, I can't trust you\nPain is much more than I could ever be\n\nMade your mind\nInner source saw a place to exceed god\nWhy need god\nWhat's safe to see we let the eyes\nI can see no god\n...\n\n", 
        "Taking life for itself\nYou call yourself a man\nDeclare it as a sin\nWho are you to judge\nCan't stand alone behind your own words\n\nWe made you as a coward\nWe blame you, you loser\nWe name you as a coward\nSo you deserve to fly away\n\nWe have seen so many fail\nTrying to change people for better\nEvolved to minus side\nAnd the number is growing\n...\n\n", 
        "How sick you ever wanna be\nAble to see the light\nSuffer boy leash won't break\nHow hard you try\n\nHelplessly tilt the time for me\nCan you help this only for me\n...\n\n", 
        "Show no mercy to anyone\nThought that all nonsense is past\nIt's all coming back\nStronger than ever\nBlood in your veins belongs to me\nAin't going to reckon you to be my voice\nNot the one to speak for me\nSome day flames will reach up there\n\nPains and accuses from times\n...\n\n", 
        "Crawling ditches\nSearching for early days\nLook at this world\nIt says clearly not for you\n\n? low vacant\nIt's not for pretty eyes\nYou gonna take it\nIt's pointing straight at you\n\nHow alone you must be\nThat you can't really feel\n...\n\n", 
        "They're gonna grill the truth out of you\nCompression for everyone\nIt's not a miracle how you break\nSeeing the signs of declining\nNo one is going to help you out\nIt's like the breeding horses\n\nYou told me how you've been, been waiting\n\nAlways praising final hours\n...\n\n", 
        "You're living in a lie\nI learned it from you\nAll the shit took a twisted turn\nI'm tired of running\nLiving in a pile of crap\nAnd following you\nLearn how to judge and control\nLearn how to keep the smile forgotten\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Got a point of the lost\nRealize the damage done\nBut I won't back down this time\nLosing everything that I've ever had\n\nYet another day lays done\nThis promise fail in my name\nYet another day you're gone\nLie to yourself one more time\n...\n\n", 
        "Got lost in the battle\nShared the warfield with an instigator\nWas it a bad dream hiding behind the truth\nI can't share this with you\n\nAre you really as approachable as you let us imagine\nCan you show me where we stand\nThere must be an easy way to get this thing done right\nCapsizing walls around us\nModernized youth\n...\n\n", 
        "In this place, in this place I feel like dying\nYou have to try harder, otherwise you'll fall\nThey can smell your weaknesses\nIn this place, in this place I feel like dying\nYou have to try much harder, otherwise you'll fall for good\n\nThis may sound like a prayer but it's not\nThis is a written sentence from a man who doesn't know much but he cares\nThese lines are taken from a book, from an unwritten one\nCan you follow your own shadow\n...\n\n", 
        "Surrounded by leaders\nWe are the dregs of life\nDo not panic, leave no trace\nPretend to not care\nDo you ever dream about making a difference\nDo you ever dream about making a difference\n\nI have waited all my life\nFor someone to get me out of here\nI never knew the view from the edge\nOf the world would look like this\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you believe this\nDo you even have time for me\nThere is something I want to say\nBut the question is, do I ever dare to ask\nDisable the mire of our souls\nWho do we think we are\nWho do we think we are\n\nI'm praying for that day to come\n...\n\n", 
        "Watch as the white ocean waves hit the shore\nAnd purge your soul of all burden and routine\nThere's an open fire inside me\nCome look closer and embrace it\n\nUnder those lights I felt safe\n...\n\n", 
        "It's the fear of not having enough time\nThat keeps me awake at night\nThoughts of escape\nIn this wretched world life is underrated\nWith hands so warm I cover my suppressed heart\nThe heart that once settled for too little\nAs darkness prevails I can see the light\nI am the architect of new beginnings\n\nRight here, tonight, I am guided by fire\n...\n\n", 
        "White paper and empty places\nThe head between my shoulders,\nwounded and bleeding badly\nI can smell your remorse\nStains all over\n\nBeen outside and seen it all\nYou are the master, you know it all\nMade yourself a number\n...\n\n", 
        "The beaten ends of this sickening life\nAnd mistakes we've been crying about\nBorn to a world of lies\nIt's the constant sorrow - bolted into your heart\nYou own the agony - the one I'm looking for\n\nMeaningless mess boils inside your head\nCan't let it out\nMaybe someday is all you can say\nThat is not a promise but a lie\nFound myself on the tracks\nFollowing my own traces\n...\n\n", 
        "We are falling down so slowly\nIn small pieces like your kingdom of glass\nWe've been waiting for so long\nAnd this is just a beginning\n\nI hear your thin voice calling from the mist\nA distant siren awakens me from sleep\nAnd I know I have to be ready\nI take a deep breath and walk outside\n\n...\n\n", 
        "So now it's time to make things right\nWe have been doing damage, enough for now\nYou see, it wasn't always like this\nYou blame the world, I think she's innocent\n\nYou all know how to put me away for good\nAnd how to comfort my shrinking heart\n\nI hear a distant voice speaking, \nRepeating the same question again\nWish I had an answer to please you all, \nSo that we could seal this day like a letter\n\n...\n\n",
