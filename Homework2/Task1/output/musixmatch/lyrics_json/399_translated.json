        "I'm on lonely street age nearly three\nRecently Mama's crying all the time\nis it because of me or my younger sister,\neven Dad was weeping when he kissed her.\nFace all puffy like a blister,\ncrying like he missed her.\nSince we moved away from the house,\nwhere we used to play.\nThey say I'll understand on day but I doubt it,\nMama never say nothing about it.\n\nHow'd it get to be so crowded.\nI found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.\nAnd I can't escape the feeling,\nmaybe I'm to blame. So I strain to listen,\nPraying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.\nThis feels like extradition or exile,\nMama finds it hard to smile\nSo I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.\nShe says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.\nBut she know I want my Dad I want my family back.\n\nI'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.\nCouldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.\nTook offense, took the kids,\n...\n\n",
