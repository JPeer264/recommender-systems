        "Two dollars shy of a five dollar bill\nLast mile I pushed my truck uphill\nAbout hurt me\nI left my truck by the pump right where I parked it\nWalked through the doors of the Last Chance Market\nHave mercy, I was thirsty\nThe guy behind the counter said what's it gonna be\nI said I don't know man, you tell me\n\nIt's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack\nOne goes in my tank, one comes in a sack\nMakes life complicated when it costs the same\nHell it ain't no fun, to do without one\nBut I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run\nIt's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean\nIt's either beer of gasoline\n\nI could feel that video camera watch me\n...\n\n", 
        "The bluest skies don't seem so blue\nAnd the stars seem to be a little dimmer too\nNow that you're around, you put 'em all to shame\nLet me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is\n\nNo one gets me like you when you kiss me\nGirl, you rock me harder than some downtown band\nI thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue\nI never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm pushing you away each time I pull up that ole barstool,\nAnd drownin' you in every drop I drink.\nI'm telling you to go to hell but I'm talking to myself\ncause you're not around to hear what I think.\nI'm trying to teach my heart to hate you,\nBut it ain't workin' right\nNow the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight.\n...\n\n", 
        "It was the thirtyfirst gathering of the\nThompsons, Joneses, and Smiths\nThere were tables full of chicken\nTaters, collard greens, and grits\nWell it all took place at Hatie Lake State Park\nVolleyball, fishin', badmitton, yard darts\nAunt Irene said she'd never seen a turnout like this\n\nWell it started with hand shakes\nAnd lordy, how the babies have grown\nAs the sun got hotter the day got to draggin' along\nI saw Uncle Gene comin' back from his car\nWith somethin' clear as water in a mason jar\nThe lemonade got hearty and, Lordy, the party was on\n\nThat ol' boom box got louder and louder\nActin' civilzed didn't seem to matter\nEverybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, they say your kiss is like forbidden fruit,\nOne taste of your sweet strawberry lips,\nAnd I'll be hooked on you, they\nSay one day just like a dog,\nYou'll own me I say lay it on me I'm six foot four and tough as a man can be,\nI ain't scared of much, I'll buck right up, there's a fightin' side of me,\nThey say I'll turn to putty and you'll mold me, well lay it on me,\n\n(Chorus)\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You take a wrong turn, drop a ball, fall short, you labor in vain\nYou choke, miss the boat, bomb out, cave in, fall flat on your face\nYeah that's everyday life\nBut sometimes...\n\nYou hit a good lick, the stars light up\nYour ship comes in, you make your mark\nYou catch a break, and you're sittin' on top\nYeah, cream of the crop!\nYou're the stuff, you set the bar\nYou beat the odds and there you are\nSpend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn\nBut every now and then you burn\n\nYou go wild in style, chest out chin up, you're king for a day\nAnd then reality hits like a fist, hits you hard, steels your thunder away\n...\n\n", 
        "Hangin' out at the old park pool\nRight after Sunday school\nBanana Boat, a rubber float\nAnother summer afternoon\n\nBon fire at the creek tonight\nBubba bringin' some homemade wine\nJust enough to catch a buzz\nAnd get us countrified\n\nOh, my my, that's just the way we do it\n...\n\n", 
        "I should have took you dancing\nA little candlelight romancing, with roses\nBut I was high up on a barstool\nYeah, I was such a blind fool\nNow I know it\n\nYou won't believe how much I've changed since you left\nIt took losing you for me to find myself\nOh I wish that you could see me\nSteady hands without the whiskey\nYou'd be so proud\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Little beads of light were dancin' off the wall\nReflectin' off the spinning crystal ball\nIn a dance hall down in Texas, where time slowed to a crawl\nBaby, it's just you holdin' on to me in the middle of it all\n\nOh girl, you're the center of my world\nThat place in my universe\nTo me you're every dream I dream\nThe air I breathe, my everything\nA ray of sunlight shinin' down\nThe point my life revolves around\nIt's like I live to love you girl\n...\n\n",
