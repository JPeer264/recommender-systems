        "As I look around the world today, all I see is pain and suffering. Poverty and a sickening disease and just a few who would make you believe.\n\nThat your money goes to a worthy a cause, third world aid & venereal whores. And some may that you give them a chance, or see the light and make a stance.\n\nWhat's it all about? That's what I say! Work it out for yourself it ain't our way! What's it all about? That's what I say! Work it out for yourself it ain't our way!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613313387)",
