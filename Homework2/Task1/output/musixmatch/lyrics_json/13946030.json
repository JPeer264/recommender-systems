        "You were calling out from the underground\nYou had lots of big ideas but no one can hear them now\nThey riddled you with guilt\nThey tempted you with wealth\nThey twisted all your words\nThey made you hate yourself\n\nSo now you do your schtick, a loyal patriot\nAnd you toe the party line even though it makes you sick\n...\n\n", 
        "All the founding fathers sewed their seeds\nIn the southern coast\nAll the godless heathens had to leave\nTo make a newer world\n\nSo we could live together in America\nJustice is blinding so is love\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n\nAll the stolen melodies they played\nIn the hit parade\nAll the power spirituals they fade\n...\n\n",

        "There is a lynching at Home Depot of the last day laborer\nIn this sanctuary city with its anchor-baby births\nThey say \"Its time we had some justice for the white race on this earth\nThis place is strange and getting stranger\"\n\n\"We got to round 'em up!\nDoor to door tonight we're ready\"\nKnock Knock Knock\n\"Drag them from their beds\nThey got some nerve to say they were here first\"\n...\n\n", 
        "When tear gas falls and bullets fly\nI'm going to stay right by your side\nThe police push and you just smile\nThey could never match your style\n\nAll winter we will march\nBy spring this town is ours\n\nOh Camila\nYou have a fire in your heart\nThey tried to say this was impossible\nBut I know you'll prove them wrong\n\nOh Camila\nYou have the people in your palm\n...\n\n",
