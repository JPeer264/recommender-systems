        "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine\nmeltin' in a pot of thieves\nwild card up my sleeve\nthick heart of stone\nmy sins my own\nthey belong to me, me\n\npeople say \"beware!\"\nbut I don't care\nthe words are just\nrules and regulations to me, me\n\nI-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud\nI'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed\nand I go to this here party and I just get bored\nuntil I look out the window, see a sweet young thing\nhumpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter\noh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine\nand I got this crazy feeling and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine\nooh I'll put my spell on her\n\nhere she comes\nwalkin' down the street\nhere she comes\n...\n\n", 
        "Late afternoon, dreaming hotel\nWe just had the quarrel that sent you away.\nI was looking for you, are you gone gone?\nCalled you on the phone, another dimension.\nWell, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.\nI went looking for you, are you gone, gone?\nDown by the ocean it was so dismal,\nWomen all standing with a shock on their faces.\nSad description, oh I was looking for you.\n\nEveryone was singing, girl is washed up\n...\n\n", 
        "His father died and left him a little farm in New England.\nAll the long black funeral cars left the scene\nAnd the boy was just standing there alone\nLooking at the shiny red tractor\nHim and his daddy used to sit inside\nAnd circle the blue fields and grease the night.\nIt was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars\n'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.\nThen he put his head in the crux of his arm\nAnd he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,\nLet the ship slide open, and he went inside of it\nAnd saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,\nHe saw his daddy 'hind the control board,\nAnd he was very different tonight\n'Cause he was not human, he was not human.\n\nAnd then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy\nThat the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,\nWhite lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly\nAnd he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,\nNo black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven\nAnd fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,\n\"No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,\nTake me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,\nLet the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it\nWhere you're not human, you are not human.\"\n\nBut nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.\nNobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm\nAnd they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered\n...\n\n", 
        "Every night before I go to sleep\nFind a ticket, win a lottery,\nScoop the pearls up from the sea\nCash them in and buy you all the things you need.\n\nEvery night before I rest my head\nSee those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.\nI know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.\nI take that money, buy you things you never had.\n\nOh, baby, it would mean so much to me,\nOh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.\nI'll buy you a jet plane, baby,\nGet you on a higher plane to a jet stream\n...\n\n", 
        "The wall is high, the black barn,\nThe babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes\nAnd I know soon that the sky will split\nAnd the planets will shift,\nBalls of jade will drop and existence will stop.\nLittle sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.\nLittle sister, the fates are calling on you.\nAh, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,\nThe sea rushes up my knees like flame\nAnd I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc\nAnd the cause is you lookin' up at me.\nOh baby, I remember when you were born,\nIt was dawn and the storm settled in my belly\nAnd I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas\nAnd I lit a match and the void went flash\nAnd the sky split and the planets hit,\nBalls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.\n...\n\n", 
        "Car stopped in a clearing,\nRibbon of life, it was nearing.\nI saw the boy break out of his skin.\nMy heart turned over and I crawled in.\nHe cried, \"Break it up, oh I don't understand,\nBreak it up, I can't comprehend.\nBreak it up, oh, I want to feel you.\nBreak it up, don't talk to me that way,\nI'm not listening.\"\n\nSnow started falling,\nI could hear the angel calling.\nWe rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.\nThe boy flew away and he started to sing.\nHe sang, \"Break it up, oh, I don't understand.\n...\n\n", 
        "The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea\nFrom the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating\nAnother boy was sliding up the hallway\nHe merged perfectly with the hallway,\nHe merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway\n\nThe boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,\nbut the movie kept moving as planned\nThe boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,\nHe drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny\nThe boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,\nstarted crashing his head against the locker,\nstarted crashing his head against the locker,\nstarted laughing hysterically\n\nWhen suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by\nhorses, horses, horses, horses\ncoming in in all directions\nwhite shining silver studs with their nose in flames,\nHe saw horses, horses, horses, horses,\nHorses, horses, horses, horses.\nDo you know how to pony like bony maroney\nDo you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this\nBaby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator\nAnd you twist the twister like your baby sister\nI want your baby sister, give me your baby sister,\nDig your baby sister\nRise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,\nRoll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,\nGot to lose control and then you take control,\nThen you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,\nLike it like that, like it like that, like it like that,\nThen you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi\n\nLife is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin\nAngel looks down at him and says, \"Oh, pretty boy,\nCan't you show me nothing but surrender?\"\nJohnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,\nTaped to his chest there's the answer,\nYou got pen knives and jack knives and\nSwitchblades preferred, switchblades preferred\nThen he cries, then he screams, saying\nLife is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain\nAnd I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,\nGo Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,\nAnd go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi\n\nThere's a little place, a place called space\n...\n\n", 
        "I just don't know what to do tonight,\nMy head is aching as I drink and breathe\nMemory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.\n...\n\n", 
        "People try to put us d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)\nJust because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)\nThings they do look awful c-c-cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation)\nI hope I die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation)\n\nrefrain:\nThis is my generation\nThis is my generation, baby\n\nWhy don't you all f-fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation)\n...\n\n"
