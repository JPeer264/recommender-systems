        "Open your eyes and turn off your mind\nStep right up folks\nAnd you will find a growing trend\nAn epidemic spread with zen and hypodermics, yeah, yeah\n\nJust close your mind\nYou can find all that you need with your eyes\n\nThe big machines take care of you\nUntil you kill yourself\nAnd then the sales go through the roof\nCalculated, formulated\n\nFeed my head with simple thoughts\nAnd let me breathe instead of being taught\nAll bottled up and tearing at the seams, I\u2019m bored\nJust let me breathe\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "A thorn in my side, chip on my shoulder\nA lump in my throat, the size of a boulder\nThe chill up my spine, can' t get any colder\nAnd you wonder why I can't smile\n\nA knot in my gut, an ape on my back\nIn the heat of the moments I'm knocked off the track\nYou drop the ball, I pick up the slack\nAnd you ask me why my hair's gray\n\nTwisting, turning, losing all sense of yearning\nLiving and learning the pressure keeps on burning my soul\nBurning my soul, burning my soul\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "He's just the kind of man you hear about\nWho leaves his family for an easy out\nThey never saw the signs, he never said a word\nHe couldn't take another day\n\nCarry me to the shoreline\nBury me in the sand\nWalk me across the water\nAnd maybe you'll understand\n\nOnce the stone you're crawling under\nIs lifted off your shoulders\nOnce the cloud that's raining over your head disappears\nThe noise that you'll hear is the crashing down of hollow years\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Lost in the sky\nClouds roll by and I roll with them\nArrows fly\nSeas increase and then fall again\n\nThis world is spinning around me\nThis world is spinning without me\nAnd every day sends future to past\nEvery breath leaves one less to my last\n\nWatch the sparrow falling\nGives new meaning to it all\nIf not today nor yet tomorrow\nThen some other day\n\nI'll take seven lives for one\nAnd then my only father's son\nAs sure as I ever did love him\nI am not afraid\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
