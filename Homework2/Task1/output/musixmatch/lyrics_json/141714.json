        "My timeline is a wire wrapped tight around my neck\nSlowing apathy swells, give in to disconnect\nUnworldly transmission fed to relive the shame\nI don't want a trial, I'll take all the blame\nA stone stolid council Speaks dogmatically\nBullets and antidotes divided evenly\nA chilling consciousness wakes me from the trance\nIt redefines my mind I'll never have a chance\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sharia, under a beauty curse\nDear pariah, caught in the cycle\nDeath and adversity, 9 of consent,\nBroken code, the watchdogs trailed, followed your scent\n\nNo chance and just desperate for love\nNo witness, his words he got off on\nWatched the fall, they did nothing\nBut the wind carries your flight\n...\n\n", 
        "Envy\u2019s blade, Ego plague\nTried to take me out twisted hate\nTrap of lies took you down\nBecause you had to taste the bait\n\nRed as blood and vague as the sky\nI can\u2019t believe the things you deny\n\nThankless art, loveless heart\nTake it out on me to pass it through\nRe-rejected, smoke curling\nClearly I must\u2019ve got to you\n\nRunning the course, outside the line\n...\n\n", 
        "Under frozen after hours\nCarnal words and dreams devoured\nIn here nothing else can matter\nDisappear\n\nSenses climb and take her with\nWritten like a fiery myth\nCan't fight what is coming in\nWhat is right\n\nSun crawling up skin\nWakes her from the trance\n\nSays she'll be waiting\nCan't leave this in the shadows\nIt's taken over\nWill not let go\nSays \"ain't it funny, we don't believe in fate\"\nPlease be patient\n...\n\n", 
        "Your mistakes called out and closed the door\nA special case arose from red\nPunishment from reality denied\nFace the question, the nine letters\nA beginning only belonging to itself\n\nYou hear cries of both the sides\n...\n\n", 
        "From one form to another\nMake sense of chaos and disorder\nProof borrowed masks the sorrow\nTruth in the sun as the source of order\n\nIn the mirrors light reflected\nBouncing off lies back into your eyes\nParallel wish\nEnuma Elish\nWhat's wrong with questioning the bias?\n\nDiagonal against the grain\nWhere the gods could be our hearts and minds\nWe are dying\nWe are falling\nBut there's no reason why we can't rise\n\nWhile we're here\n...\n\n", 
        "Thin line hides the unknown\nRed winged man in a papal throne\nCzar says at least he's alive\nYet evidence proves otherwise\n\nWhere is heaven then over shadows of weaponry\nTime bomb, dormant, hungry for a casualty\n\nWith blissful memories corroded\nYou desperately try to rebuild\nNow that will is eroded\nFace the man or face the kill\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My wires are crossed peeling and frayed\nI'm losing more power everyday\nScreaming at stars won't change a thing\nSome people can break the strongest of wings\n\nSometimes I shake sometimes I scream\nJust trying to wake from this bad dream\n\nMy sickness crawling out of my skin\nUp walls to scale to jump to spin\n\n...\n\n", 
        "True blue vow to the untold\nNever to have or hold\nSlip, cold intent exposed\nThe heat of hate transposed\nIdeas won\u2019t go to seed\nIn cold dark dormancy\nFertilize, crucify\nThe stunted with outright lies\n\n\"Smooth followers sing, pray on I prey on you.\nServe him, I'll serve you\"\n...\n\n", 
        "Little holes show how hollow you have become\nFighter you've been down so low for far too long\nThis city now offers only nightmares to you\nYou are too sick of being so strong\n\nFeet dangling in the open grave\nEveryone else was always to blame\nPresent yourself like flower to the bee\nWalking on, waking up losing dreams\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Believe you're the only one\nReal followers through deception\nKnow I won't be in unison\nForce another shallow connection\nPass it all by think\nYou're still at the center\nLet it all waste away as you sit and ignore\nBelieve they never knew before you entered\nLike the others that came far before\n\nCHORUS\nGo play off another cliche\nCall it all your own\nI'll hold onto the things\nThat you've never known\n\n...\n\n", 
        "A pushed patience\nWill finally take its toll\nBurn away lost hours\nBurn another hole\n\n(Burn another hole, burn another hole...)\n\nFollow trails of fingertips\nLive through your breath\nLeaving you will be like\nThe burden of death\n\nDo we turn to logic or\nFollow love blindly\nRelease all we instilled or\n...\n\n", 
        "Sunday left me helpless\nMonday left me shareless\nTuesday's nothing more\nThe rest is unaccounted for\n\nI found more to life than love\nI found more to life above\nI found out\n...\n\n", 
        "Uncover the veiled shadows\nLet it seep throughout\nEmbrace the state\nLight through darkness still shines through\nPurely easier to let complicate\nRevive a dormant spirit\nSpill over darkened shades\nUnder quickness awakened\nThis balance will never fade\n\nDetach from crippling divisions\nFeel outside your skin\n...\n\n", 
        "Interlocked, insatiable, unraveled and untwined\nAll that i have left is what i wish i'd left behind\nWith ignorance ignored i threw it all away\nIf only you believed there's more than just today\n\nLonging for those never met\nFallen to a fear far crueler than regret\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Subversive mystics\nTaking over you\n\nSpent my self worth\nOn your unworthy soul\nBut i will regain the toll\n\nThe past is all that remains\nOver skies turned black blue and gray\n\nCapture the wreckage that holds strong\nTo your restrain these words will stain\n\nYou said shred\nTrust here in now\nBut i found new eyes to clear\n\nThe past is all that remains\nOver skies turned black blue and gray\nThrough a shield of fears\nYou say return but your hand led me here\n\nSorry i broke you calm\n...\n\n",
