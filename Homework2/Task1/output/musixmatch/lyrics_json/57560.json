        "The sun burned hot, it burned my eyes\nBurned so hot I thought I'd died\nThought I'd died and gone to hell\nLookin' for the water from a deeper well\nI went to the river but the river was dry\nI fell to my knees an I looked to the sky\nI looked to the sky and the spring rain fell\nI saw the water from a deeper well\n\nWell... lookin for the water from a deeper well\nWell... lookin for the water from a deeper well\n\nI was ready for love I was ready for the money\nReady for the blood and ready for the honey\nReady for the winnin', ready for the bell\nLookin' for the water from a deeper well\n...\n\n",

        "(Nicky Mehta)\n\nAcross that river through the orange squares of light\nPast the streetlamp like a beacon in the rain\nYou've stopped in all this motion\nYou're heavy with news too sudden\nYou're breathing through this undertow of pain\n\nAnd all your friends will gather soon\nAnd you'll surface then to bring them through\nYou'll say \"it's better this way\" and \"at least we knew\"\n...\n\n",
