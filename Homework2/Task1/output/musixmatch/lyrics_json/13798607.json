        "Well there goes my girl\nInto the chapel\nNow she's walking down the aisle\nAnd it feels just like a mile\nAnd I shake shake shake like a leaf\nAnd I'm lyin' lyin' lyin' through my teeth\nI got a pocket full of handshakes\nAnd it don't mean nothin'\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Fell asleep with a cigarette\nTo the flicker of a TV set\nNo one saw you wave your white flag\nNo one saw your family photo album\nNever saw your family photo album\n\nFought some battles and we lost the war\nAnd there's ashtrays all on the floor\n\"The city ain't beat me yet\" he said\nTo the flicker of a TV set\nTo the blue light of a TV set\n\nI'm takin' ya home\nHang up the phone\nWe'll listen to radio\nKeep your head up kid\nI know you can swim\nBut ya gotta move your legs\n\nI'm takin' ya home\nHang up the phone\nWe'll listen to radio\n...\n\n", 
        "We were headlong into the abyss\nIn a four door sedan\nAnd a kid that always stuttered\nWe stole it, for the feeling, of stealing\nAnd drove it, like our days had been stolen\n\nFollow me down\nFollow me down\nFollow me down\nWe'll raise our glass\nTo borrowed cash\nTo borrowed cash\nOur wheels touched the highway\nWe traveled on down\nFrom the valley that raised us up to shrink down\nAnd gave us the drive\n...\n\n", 
        "On a park bench sat a crimson beating heart\nAnd behind him the girls played double dutch in the park\nThe sun began to burn his snow white skin\nI guess you\u2019re headin\u2019 somewhere or endin\u2019 up somewhere..\n\nStorm clouds began to form in his head\nAnd crisscrossed his mind like a restless angry ocean\nAnd the howling of hardship and heartache\nKneeled and grinned in his face\n\nHe stood there in his shoes unable to move\nI drove all night here to tell you I love you\n\nAnd here lies my green eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "The crowd began to wave\nFrom the freeway overpass\nWe joined the parade\nRight behind the marching band\n\nYou said\n\"Wave back, cause these are the best days of your life.\"\nAnd I said\n\"I know, I can't feel anything\"\n\nAnd up, up on the Ferris wheel\nI can see L.A. and all the freeways\nI can see your face\n...\n\n", 
        "The old man turned and scratched his chin\nHe said \"Son I wouldn't know where to begin, but your daddy's gone,\nHe's gone down south... it was all he would talk about\"\n\nWe never blamed it on the soil\nOr the sunburned earth\nOr the prices of the oil\nThis border town is my home\nI got rattlesnake guts\nIn a desert full of bones\n\nTell my sister I've gone and to find someone\ncause I won't come back no more, no more\n\nLord I see red and it's storming in my head\nI got cathedrals in my ears and I think my Daddy's dead\nLord I see red and I'm prayin' on my bed\nI got a drunk for a mother\nGot a saint for a brother\n\nNow the sun is shinin' on my hood\nThe statue on the dashboard\nOf Maria looks beautiful,\nAnd I'm headin' down south\nI got tequila in my veins\n...\n\n", 
        "The city hadn't twinkled in ages\nIt was lost in a fog\nAnd we could disappear just as easy\nAnd we're already gone\nTo rise up from some dirty ashes,\nTo put away all our sobs\nAnd now we're choking on the tears\nBut this is not your fault\n\nIt's the city of brotherly love,\nIt's the city of brotherly love\nIt's the city of brotherly love\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you try?\nCould you buy a new drink for the old drunk\nIt's no crime to resign misery with a bottle\nYou walked into town without making a sound\nAs you slipped and you slammed your face into the crowd\nAs you tried to forget all the words that were said\nTo deny all the things that you keep in your head\n\nWhen you came you were new but today you're much older\nYou were spent so you went to get used in the corner\nWhere they kicked you around like a rodeo clown\nAs it echoed through town they were beating you down\nAnd as the the word then spread that you liked how it hurt\n...\n\n", 
        "You can try to fix them\nBut your sea legs just went seasick\nWalking with rubber bands\nAnd waking with empty hands\n\nYou're goin' to stay sane\nGonna clean up all the stains\nOf your whoring and then some,\nJust in time to fix your head\n\nWe're on a train\n...\n\n", 
        "Put up a fight\nLike a ghost ship in the night\nCount to 2, count to 3!\nAnd fade away\n\nWent overboard\nSaid curses to the lord\nCount to 4, count to 5!\nAnd sink a ways\n\nYou hate yourself\nPut the bottle on the shelf\nCount to 7, count to 8!\nAnd weep that way\n...\n\n",
