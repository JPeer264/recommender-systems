        "Nah, you don't know me\nLightning above and a fire below me\nYou can not catch me, can not hold me\nYou can not stop, much less control me\nohohhoo\nWhen it rains, it pours\nWhen the floodgates open, brace your shores\nThat pressure don't care, it breaks your doors\n\nSay it's all you can take, better take some more\n'Cause I know what it's like to test fate\nHad my shoulders pressed with that weight\n\nStood up strong in spite of that hate\n\nThe night gets darkest right before dawn\nWhat don't kill you makes you more strong\nAnd I've been waiting for it so long\nThe nights go on\nWaiting for a light that never comes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)"
