        "You'll never see the courage I know\nIt's color's richness won't appear within your view\nI'll never glow the way that you glow\nYour presence dominates the judgements made on you\n\nBut as the scenery grows I see in different lights\nThe shades and shadows undulate in my perception\nMy feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights\nI understand what I am still too proud to mention... to you\nYou'll say you understand, but you don't understand\nYou'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eye\nBut never is a promise, and you can't afford to lie\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been a bad, bad girl\nI've been careless with a delicate man\nAnd it's a sad, sad world\nWhen a girl will break a boy\nJust because she can\n\nDon't you tell me to deny it\nI've done wrong and I wanna suffer for my sins\nI've come to you cause I need guidance to be true\nAnd I just don't know where I can begin\n\nWhat I need is a good defense\nCause I'm feelin' like a criminal\nAnd I need to be redeemed\nTo the one I've sinned against\nBecause he's all I ever knew of love\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I tell you how I feel, but you don't care\nI say tell me the truth, but you don't dare\nYou say love is a hell you cannot bear\nAnd I say gimme mine back and then go there, for all I care\n\nI got my feet on the ground\nAnd I don't go to sleep to dream\nYou got your head in the clouds\nYou're not at all what you seem\nThis mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled\nBy your deviant ways\nSo don't forget what I told you,\nDon't come around, I got my own hell to raise\n\nI have never been so insulted in all my life\nI could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride\nFirst you run like a fool just to be at my side\nAnd now you run like a fool, but you just run to hide\nAnd I can't abide\n...\n\n", 
        "You moved like honey in my dream last night\nYeah, some old fires were burning\nYou came near to me and you endeared to me\nBut you couldn't quite discern me\n\nDoes that scare you?\nI'll let you run away\nBut your heart will not oblige you\nYou'll remember me like a melody\nYeah, I'll haunt the world inside you\n\nAnd my big secret -- gonna win you over\nslow like honey, heavy with mood\n\nI'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard\n...\n\n", 
        "Darling, give me your absence tonight\nTake the shade from the canvas and leave me the\nwhite\nLet me sink in the silence that echoes inside\nand don't bother leaving the light on\n\nCause I suddenly feel like a different person\nFrom the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersion\nand I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion --\na vacancy that just did not belong\n...\n\n", 
        "Days like this, I don't know what to do with myself\nall day -- and all night\nI wander the halls along the walls and under my\nbreath\nI say to myself\nI need fuel -- to take flight\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that year\nThe autumn days swung soft around me, like cotton on my skin\nBut as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared\nMy heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within\nBut then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full\nAnd sank in the burrows of my keep\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Won't do no good to hold no seance\nWhat's gone is gone and you can't bring it back around\nWon't do no good to hold no searchlight\nYou can't illuminate what time has anchored down\n\nOh, Honey (I've gone a-)\nOh, Honey (I've gone a-)\nOh, Honey (I've gone away)\n\nWon't do no good to sing no love song\nNo sound could simulate the presence of a man\nWon't do no good asking no questions\nYour divination should acquaint You with the plan\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I lie in an early bed, thinking late thoughts\nwaiting for the black to replace my blue\nI do not struggle in your web because it was my aim\nto get caught\nBut daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growing\nweary\nof waiting to be consumed by you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell\nI don't think I can live without you\nAnd I know that I never will\nOh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death\nI can't say anymore than \"I love you\"\nEverything else is a waste of breath\nI want you\nYou've had your fun you don't get well no more\nI want you\nYour fingernails go dragging down the wall\nBe careful darling you might fall\nI want you\nI woke up and one of us was crying\nI want you\nYou said \"Young man I do believe you're dying\"\nI want you\nIf you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days\nI want you\nYou can look in my eyes and you can count the ways\nI want you\nDid you mean to tell me but seem to forget\nI want you\n...\n\n", 
        "I was screaming into the canyon\nAt the moment of my death\nThe echo I created\nOutlasted my last breath\n\nMy voice it made an avalanche\nAnd buried a man I never knew\nAnd when he died his widowed bride\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes\nAnd\nI certainly haven't been spreading myself around\nI still only travel by foot, and by foot it's a slow climb\nBut I'm good at being uncomfortable, so\nI can't stop changing all the time\n\nI notice that my opponent is always on the go\nAnd\nWon't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice\nHe'll hitch a ride with any guide\nAs long as they go fast from whence he came\nBut he's no good at being uncomfortable, so\nHe can't stop staying exactly the same\n\nIf there was a better way to go then it would find me\nI can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm undecided about you again\nMightn't be right that you're not here\nIt's double-sided, cause I ruined it all\n- But also saved myself, by never believing you, Dear\n\nEverything good, I deem too good to be true\nEverything else is just a bore\nEverything I have to look forward to\nHas a pretty painful and very imposing before\n\nO' Sailor, why'd you do it\nWhat'd you do that for\nSaying there's nothing to it\nAnd then letting it go by the boards\n\nO' Sailor, why'd you do it\nWhat'd you do that for\nSaying there's nothing to it\n...\n\n", 
        "The nickel dropped when I was on\nMy way beyond the rubicon\nWhat did I do?\n\nAnd the games that I could handle\nNone are ones worth the candle\nWhat can I do?\n\nI'm a frightened, fickle person\nFighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'\nWhat should I do?\n\nOooh, after all the folderol\nAnd hauling over coals stops\nWhat will I do?\n...\n\n", 
        "Those boom times went bust\nMy feet of clay, they dried to dust\nThe red isn't the red we painted, it's\nJust, rust\nAnd the signature thing that used to bring a following\nI have trouble now even remembering, so\n\nWhy did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night\nAnd keep on letting him change all my plans\nI might be so sick in the head\nI need to be bled dry to quit\nOr I just really used to love him\nI sure hope that's it\n\nI knew that to keep in touch\n...\n\n", 
        "I opened my eyes\nWhile you were kissing me once more than once\nAnd you looked as sincere as a dog\nJust as sincere as a dog does,\nWhen it's the food on your lips with which it's in love\n\nI bet you could never tell\nThat I knew you didn't know me that well\nIt is my fault you see\nYou never learned that much from me\n\nOh you silly stupid pastime of mine\n...\n\n", 
        "I was staring out the window\nThe whole time he was talking to me\nIt was a filthy pane of glass\nI couldn't get a clear view\nAnd as he went on and on\nIt wasn't the outside world I could see\nJust the filthy pane that I was looking through\n\nSo I had to break the window\nIt just had to be\nBetter that I break the window\nThan him or her or me\n\nI was never focused on just one thing\nMy eyes got fixed when my mind got soft\nIt may look like I'm concentrated on\nA very clear view\nBut I'm as good as asleep\nI bet you didn't know\nIt takes a lot of it away\nIf you do\n\n...\n\n", 
        "What you did to me made me\nSee myself something different\nThough I try to talk sense to myself\nBut I just won't listen\n\nWon't you go away\nTurned yourself in\nYou're no good at confession\nBefore the image that you burned me in\nTries to teach you a lesson\n\nWhat you did to me made me see myself somethin' awful\nA voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled\n...\n\n", 
        "Please, please, please\nNo more melodies\nThey lack impact, they're petty\nThey've been made up already\nPlease please please\nNo more maladies\nI'm so tired of crying\nYou'd think I was a siren\nBut me and everybody's on the sad, same team\nAnd You can hear our sad brains screaming:\nGive us something familiar\nSomething similar\nTo what we know already\nThat will keep us steady\nSteady,\nSteady going nowhere\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't understand about complimentary colors\nAnd what they say\nSide by side they both get bright\nTogether they both get gray\nBut he's been pretty much yellow\nAnd I've been kind of blue\nBut all I can see is\nRed, red, red, red, red\nNow... what am I gonna do\n\nI don't understand about diamonds\nAnd why men buy them\nWhat's so impressive about a diamond\n...\n\n"
