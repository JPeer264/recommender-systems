Why doesn't the breeze delight me?\nStars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Listen to the melody entrancing\nBlending in a soft and sweet refrain\nAs around the floor, dear, we are dancing\nSwaying to a fascinating strain\n\nSweet music soft and mellow\nSoothing and slow\nStrains of a mellow 'cello\nWhen lights are low\nDear, we're so close together I love you so\nWhy think about the weather\nWhen lights are low\nTwo hearts revealing\nMusic hath charms\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
