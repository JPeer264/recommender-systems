        "Well she's all you'd ever want,\nShe's the kind they'd like to flaunt and take to dinner.\nWell she always knows her place.\nShe's got style, she's got grace, She's a winner.\nShe's a Lady. Whoa whoa whoa, She's a Lady.\nTalkin' about that little lady, and the lady is mine.\nWell she's never in the way\nAlways something nice to say, Oh what a blessing.\nI can leave her on her own\nKnowing she's okay alone, and there's no messing.\nShe's a lady. Whoa, whoa, whoa. She's a lady.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
