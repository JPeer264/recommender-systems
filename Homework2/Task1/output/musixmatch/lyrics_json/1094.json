        "Our history speaks in thunder from a thousand village halls\nIn blood and sweat and sacrifice, in honouring every call\nSo the forces gathered against the thorn a-piercing in their side\nA brave new world is beckoning so the olden world must die.\nIn the offices of the city, at all the tables of oak and power\nThe snares are laid and baited for the approaching of the hour\nA hundred justifications and the presses are ready to roll\nThe gateways to the nation they are firmly under control\n\nCh: On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back\nWe went galloping down the blackened hills\n...\n\n", 
        "It's not a crime to be innocent\nThese things we have not done\nBut you're not some little child\nSpring is past and gone\n\nWell I know my craving heart\nAnd I've seen your vicious eyes\nAnd I think we know the truth\nBoth you and I\n\nWell don't flutter your lashes like a little girl\nDon't ask me why it's such a cruel, cruel world, no\n\nDon't ask any more stupid questions\nYou already know the answers\nDon't ask any more stupid questions\nYou already know the answers to\n\nKill with the best of them\nBut your smile remains so sweet\n...\n\n",

        "We're out here on the borders with our favorite few possessions\nTrading stories whispered round the fire\nAs shadows in the searchlights, mugshots in the files\nWaiting in the camps behind the wire\n\nKick the door until it opens, what you have you cannot hold\nWe are young, forever hungry, you are fat and growing old\n\nAnd every day you try to build a higher wall, a higher wall\nEvery day you try to build a higher wall, a higher wall\n\nWe picked the leaves of coca, we stack the crates of cola\nWe wait upon the tables where you dine\nAnd we learn from you not to accept the little that we're given\n...\n\n", 
        "Crackle in the lines so far away, the late night DJ starts to play\nThat sacred song goes phasing through the airwaves of the night\nBeyond the lonely light house beam, beyond these black and restless dreams\nShe'll wake before I go to sleep in the silver morning light\nCh: Carry these words over the ocean, carry these words over the sea\n...\n\n", 
        "I felt a shiver in the heat-haze\nThe waiting time is over\nStrange tongues on the airwaves\nAs the voices call from distant lands\n\nI saw which was the winning side\nBut still I joined the other\nAnd I'm in love with every strange unfolding day\nAs the storm begins to break cover\n\nLet the whirlwind blow\nThrough the ice, the melting, melting snows\nLet the whirlwind blow\nAcross the freezing skies and the tiny lights below\nLet the whirlwind blow\n\nAnd so we shutter up the doorways\nAs the ripples move towards us\nFor a moment stop breathing\nShe wakes and stirs beneath our feet\n\nThe order try to stand their ground\nWhile every battlefront is shifting\n...\n\n", 
        "You say that you'd rather be really poor\nThan scratching, saving, scrimping all the pennies\nLooking in the windows at what you can't afford\nAlways hungry, never starving\nIn no man's land the days are long\n\nYou say that you'd rather be really ill\n...\n\n", 
        "Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep\nTurning over, turning 'round, twisting in our sweat\nThey say there is no rest for the wicked ones\nDear God, what have we done?\nThere is no rest for the wicked ones\nDear God, what is this evil that we've done?\n\n...\n\n"
