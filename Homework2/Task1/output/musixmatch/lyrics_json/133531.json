        "Save my money\nFor that plane ride \nHorn of plenty\nHeavy sunlight \nAutumn's bounty\nBread and red wine\nIn a hurry\nBut there's so much time \n\nI will wait for you \nGrowing love but like water \nTime will always slip through \nI will wait for you \nBut please come soon \n\n...\n\n", 
        "Cryptic words meander \nNow there is a song beneath the song \nOne day you'll learn \nYou'll soon discern its true meaning \nAn interesting detachment \nA listless poem of love sincere \nDesire, despair \nOverlapping melodies \n\nAnd it's not a love, it's not a love \nIt's not a love, it's not a love song \n...\n\n", 
        "There was a time two fearless minds \nWell we packed up for a new place \nA college town with a musical sound \nAnd everyone had a new face \nThere was something there \nMaybe it was the trees \nOr the flowery air \nOr that everyone seemed so glad \nThey were there \nAnd we were two of those too \nWe were two of those too \n\nWe got a house in between a homeless shelter \n...\n\n", 
        "When nature talks I'm not supposed to hear \nI'm not supposed to know, don't I know \nWe never were close, I let the feeling go \nAnd let it fade inside \nI know why I love I know \nYou're leaning down, gently you say \"I want to leave\" \nSure you can go but then you will sleep alone, \n...\n\n", 
        "Watch the children sing, but not to be singers\nAnd so hopeful, they still are believers\nThere's so much to do or say without repeating\nAnd a sad story hoped she would keep reading\nMaybe a message you're just not receiving\nThere's so much to do or say without repeating\nSo why don't we?\nAnd don't expect too much, okay?\nCause the best, the worst might have passed anyway\nAnd like the light house we watched it spin 'round and 'round\n...\n\n", 
        "The dance, a bid, a matinee \nIt's a faint, a brief affinity \nIt's a touch when it shouldn't be \nBut it's all right \nAnd it's a step but you're too quick to fall \nNow a crash but it's just physical \nNot a point, except it's natural \nBut it's all right \n\nThere's no burden that will agonize you \nNo worry that will weigh you down \nNot the memories that hypnotize you \nYou won't turn around \n\nYou can't love me\nYou can't love me\nYou can't love me\nYou can't love me\n...\n\n", 
        "Afraid of an airplane \nOf a car swerving in the lane \nOf a dark cloud too low \nOr being swept away by the undertow \nOf a building tumbling down \nOf the train when it's underground \nOf the icy mountain roads \nWe have to take to get to the show \n\nThere's just a time when we must all let go the breath that we hold \nThere's just a time when we must all let go the breath that we hold \n...\n\n", 
        "Dinner call in the late afternoon\nThe sun step down for the moon\nStory books, nightlights\nAnd I still remember songs\nPiano sing-alongs\nAnd the colored sounds of spring\nIts harmony\nDo you still remember?\nFireflies, four-leaf clovers\nFingerpainted skin\nWhere life was a reaction\nAnd love was just laughing with a friend\n...\n\n", 
        "We'll bathe in rose petals, red \nAnd lie in violet lilac beds \nAnd through the darkness of the night \nWe'll watch our future shining bright \nAnd out of everyone I've met \nIt's you I can't forget \n\nAnd there was a time my heart was aching \nYes there was the day I swore it was breaking \nUnder a lucky star our love was born brand new \n\nAnd in the shadows of the night \n...\n\n", 
        "Once upon a time in a place\nFar, far away from here\nLong, long ago, the eyes\nDrift past a story lights\nAnd dream of a love that made you feel more alive\nWorth any compromise\nA love that will always keep you surprised\n...\n\n"
