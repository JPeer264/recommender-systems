        "What do you mean it's time, time for me to\ngrow up? I don't want any part. It's right\nto follow my heart. The new kids ran, ran\nout the back door fast, and the bands\nthat came before they had their noses in\nthe air. Pretending that they care about\nour scene just because our money's\ngreen. I'll tell you stage dives make me\nfeel more alive than coded messages in\nslowed down songs.\n\nNow you're so ashamed, now I'm so\nashamed of you. We believed the same\nthings. You stand to the side. Rebirth of\nhardcore pride. It all came true, too bad\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Humor's got a place like all things.\nBe aware of the pain it can sometimes bring.\nA joke to you might not be so funny,\nso take the time and think it out before you open up your mouth.\n\nI can't belive the things we say.\nA cutting word can ruin days.\nI can't belive the things we say.\nNow I wish I hadn't spoke.\nCan't you learn to take a fucking joke.\n\nWe say things we don't mean but friends understand.\nStength and humor don't always go hand in hand.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Insincerity\nNegativity\nNo Unity\nSomething's gone wrong\nThinking to myself how smart I am\nBecause I won't get caught up\nIn some dick's bad joke.\nI'll just walk away\nFight it out yourself\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
