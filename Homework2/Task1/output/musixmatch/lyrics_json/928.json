        "You can sleep forever but still you will be tired\nYou can stay as cold as stone but still you won\u2019t find peace\nWith you I feel I\u2019m the meek leading the blind\nWith you I feel I\u2019m just spending, wasting time\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting\nI\u2019m still waiting\nI\u2019ve been waiting\nI\u2019ve been waiting\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting\nI\u2019m still waiting\nI\u2019m with you\nIt\u2019s always one step too far\n\nYou can walk too far\nBut still you won\u2019t be found\n...\n\n", 
        "With one light on in one room,\nI know you're up when I get home\nWith one small step upon the stair,\nI know your look when I get there\nIf you were a king up there on your throne,\nWould you be wise enough to let me go?\nFor this queen you think you own\n\nWants to be a hunter again,\nWants to see the world alone again\nTo take a chance on life again, so let me go\n...\n\n", 
        "I just want to feel, safe in my own skin\nI just want to be, happy again\nI just want to feel, deep in my own world\n\nBut I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If you gave me just a coin\nFor every time we say goodbye ...\nWell, I'd be rich beyond my dreams\nI'm sorry for my weary life\n\nI know I'm not perfect\nBut I can smile\nAnd I hope that you see this heart\nBehind my tired eyes\n\nIf you tell me that I can't\nI will, I will, I'll try all night\n...\n\n", 
        "So you're with her, and not with me, I hope she's sweet, and so pretty\nI hear she cooks delightfully, a little angel beside you\nSo you're with her, and not with me, oh how lucky one man can be\nI hear your house is smart and clean, oh how lovely with your homecoming\nqueen\nOh how lovely it must be\nWhen you see her sweet smile baby, don't think of me\nWhen she lays in your warm arms, don't think of me\n...\n\n", 
        "I'd like to watch you sleep at night\nTo hear you breathe by my side\nAnd although sleep leaves me behind\nThere's nowhere I'd rather be\n\nAnd now our bed is oh so cold\nMy hands feel empty, no one to hold\nAnd I can sleep what side I want\nIt's not the same with you gone\n\nOh if you'd come home\nI'll let you know that\n\nAll you want is right here in this room\nAll you want\n...\n\n", 
        "A young gentleman came riding past,\nOn a snow blue winters day,\nHe asked to drink by our fire\nAnd I was pleased to let him stay,\n\nHe drank there quietly for a while,\nAnd then he turned and said to me,\n\nYour eyes are green,\nLike summer grass,\nYour lips are red,\nLike a fresh cut rose,\nYour hair is soft,\nLike an Irish stream,\nAnd your voice,\nIs filled with sweet beauty\n\nAnd the last words I heard him say\n\nWere I shall return,\nFor you,\nMy love,\nOn Christmas Day\n\nAnd the night will come,\nBut I won't sleep,\nAs I watch the stars that lead him,\nI cannot place where he is,\n...\n\n", 
        "With one light on in one room,\nI know you're up when I get home\nWith one small step upon the stair,\nI know your look when I get there\nIf you were a king up there on your throne,\nWould you be wise enough to let me go?\nFor this queen you think you own\n\nWants to be a hunter again,\nWants to see the world alone again\nTo take a chance on life again, so let me go\n...\n\n", 
        "My lover's gone\nHis boots no longer by my door\nHe left at dawn\nAnd as I slept I felt him go\nReturns no more\nI will not watch the ocean\n\nMy lover's gone\nNo earthly ships will ever bring\nHim home again\nBring him home again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "1\n\nMy tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why\nI got out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd i can't see at all\nAnd even if i could it' d all be grey,\nBut your picture on my wall it reminds me\nThat it's not so bad, it's not so bad.\n\n2\n\nI drank too much last night, got bills to pay,\n...\n\n", 
        "I didn't hear you leave\nI wonder how am I still here\nI don't want to move a thing\nIt might change my memory\n\nOh I am what I am\nI'll do what I want, but I can't hide\nI won't go, I won't sleep\nI can't breathe, until you're resting here with me\nI won't leave, I can't hide\nI cannot be, until you're resting here with me\nI don't want to call my friends\nThey might wake me from this dream\nAnd I can't leave this bed\n...\n\n", 
        "\u00c0 quem amou demais\n\u00c0 quem chorou demais\nE quanto tempo n\u00e3o d\u00e3o aten\u00e7\u00e3o\nAo seu pobre cora\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nN\u00e3o se atreve a falar\nN\u00e3o se permite errar\nQuem inventou a dor\nEsque\u00e7a o ardor\nAfinal...\n\nSe Deus te desse s\u00f3 o amanh\u00e3 pra sentir\n...\n\n",
