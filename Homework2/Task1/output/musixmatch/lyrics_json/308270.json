        "The paths have been crossed\nThe crumbs are gone and the way, and the way is lost\nMelancholy phantoms eye our skins\nPoison apples falling with the wind\n\nHear the sigh of the trees\nThose who enter here never leave\n\nAnd the rangers stream out of their cabins\nThey are the hunters\nWe are the rabbits\nMaybe we don't want to be found\nMaybe we don't want to be found\n\nFurther in and on we go\nSightless creatures tugging at our clothes\nCutting through the twilight, sword in hand\n...\n\n", 
        "Your fingertips across my skin\nThe palm trees swaying in the wind\nImages\nYou sang me Spanish lullabies\nThe sweetest sadness in your eyes\nClever trick\n\nWell, I'd never want to see you unhappy\nI thought you'd want the same for me\n\nGoodbye, my almost lover\nGoodbye, my hopeless dream\nI'm trying not to think about you\nCan't you just let me be\nSo long, my luckless romance\nMy back is turned on you\nShoulda known you'd bring me heartache\nAlmost lovers always do\n...\n\n", 
        "Standing still i'm gonna stand still, stiller than the stones\nyou know i will, oh you can test my will, it won't go breaking with my bones\ntake a picture, take a lasting look of the girl you once adored\nhide it somewhere in your secret book, think of me no more\n\nfollowing my wish into the well, down into your deepest dark i fell\ndrowning with your kisses in the well,\ni look to you for saving but you're saving someone else.\n...\n\n",
