        "Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?\nYou been out ridin' fences for so long now.\nOh, you're a hard one,\nBut I know that you've got your reasons.\nThese things that are pleasin' you,\nCan hurt you somehow.\n\nDon't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,\nShe'll beat you if she's able.\nKnow the queen of hearts is always your best bet.\nNow it seems to me, some fine things,\nHave been laid upon your table.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Remember when the days were long\nAnd rolled beneath a deep blue sky?\nDidn't have a care in the world\nWith mommy and daddy standing by\n\nWhen happily ever after fails\nAnd we've been poisoned by these fairy tales\nThe lawyers dwell on small details\nSince daddy had to fly\n\nAah, but I know a place where we can go\nThat's still untouched by men\nWe'll sit and watch the clouds roll by\nAnd the tall grass waves in the wind\n\nAnd you can lay your head back on the ground\nAnd let your hair fall all around me\nOffer up your best defense but this is the end\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
