        "Nine hours passed and how long will it last\nSays the man with the plan and a gun in his hand.\nHe's scared but prepared it might be as he feared,\nAre they still in control, and safe behind the wall?\n\nThis evening's too quiet, oh we need a real riot\nTo shake and to break and to bite like a snake.\nWe're stuck in this attic so bored and so static,\nTomorrow they'll ask us to throw off our masks.\n\nBut the storm is a'coming 'cross the hills tonight,\nLike a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight.\nThe storm is a'coming 'cross the hills tonight,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
