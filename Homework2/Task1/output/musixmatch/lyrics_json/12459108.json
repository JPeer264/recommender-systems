        "Take me to the docks, there's a ship without a name\nIt is sailing to the middle of the sea\nThe water there is deeper than anything you've ever seen\n...Jump right in and swim until you freeze\n\nI will remember your face\n'Cause I am still in love with that place\n...\n\n", 
        "All the water, all the water in the world...\nStop my heart, stop, lay for once.\nAnd do you know, the secret road...\nWhere I can go, to see and feel you grow\n\nIf it's not too much, I would love to see you there\nWith bone colored skin and flowers in your hair\nIf it's not too much, I would love to see you there\nWith bone colored skin and flowers in your hair.\n...\n\n", 
        "I named a star for you\nI named a star after you\nBut that wasn't bright enough for you\n\nI climbed a hill for you\nI climbed a hill just for you\nBut you said \"That's nothing new, what does that prove?\"\n\nI know if I find when you hide in your mind, I'll get lost in it\n...\n\n", 
        "There is nothing we could say or do\nTo stop the world from tearing us in two\nFrom your heart there I drew a line\nThrough the water and down your spine\n\nI put a hole in my hand to see you\nI drew a line through the sand to be with you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If you crash your car into your best friends house\nWould you be quiet as words came out of their mouths?\nStop, don't do it, I have been waiting for it\nStop, I knew it would come\n\nIf you find a god next to your girlfriend's bed\nWould it be hard to sort out your spinning head?\nStop, don't say that, dear, that you wanted him here\nStop, don't give him a clear\n...\n\n", 
        "this is thre end,\nhold your breath and count to ten,\nfeel the earth movend,\nhear my heart burst again,\nfor this is the end,\ni've drowned and dreamed this moment,\nso overdue i owe them,\nswept away i'm stolen,\nlet the skyfall,\nwhen it crumbles,\nwe will stand tall and face it all together,\nlet the skyfall,\nwhen it crumbles,\nwe will stand tall and face it all at skyfall,\nat skyfall,\nskyfall is where we start,\na thousand miles and frozen heart,\n...\n\n", 
        "When you were young\nYou lost on everyone\nThen you closed your eyes\nAnd said your goodbyes\n\n\nIn a year\nOr ten, I will be there\nI will come for you\nWhen you are on your own\n\n\nOn a chair\nIn a room with no one else\nI will touch your hand\nAnd say I understand\n\n\nWhat we lost\nIs equal to the cause\nOf my skin on yours\nAnd say you want it back\n\n\nIf you get time\nCome back and be mine\nIf you pass by\n...\n\n", 
        "Wherever you are\nFloating on a boat or on a star\nWhatever you do\nEvery time we touch you move\n\nYou have different eyes\nFor every time your heart arrives\nI want you to sigh\nIt's alright\n\nI am finally swimming you are the line\nIf this is a moon land, darling\nYou'd be the find\nI wanted to keep you close\nMake you mine\n...\n\n",
