        "Life can be anything we want it to be, get the walls.\nWe can not look back, but think about.\nThey can't stop, they can't stop us now, \nFrom our thoughts and our dreams with the visions of liberty.\nFor all those sleepless nights, in arms you can't reach, we'll fall.\nWe are shaping; we are taking everything to the ground.\nYou can't save us\n\nYou can't save us from ourselves\nYou can't even save yourselves.\nYou can't stop us from our thoughts, \nOur visions of a better world.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "Now climbing mountains on the verge of the fall,\nbut looking backwards in time,\nI could feel the walls about to break.\nAnd losing devotion in time has meant there will be nothing left for me.\n\nWe are the solution.\nBreathe, breathe in the bright,\nbreathe in the sight.\nBreathe in, it's all around you.\nBreathe, breathe in the sight,\nbreathe in the bright.\nProve that it's all around you.\n\nWe are the creation.\nWe are the solution to all.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
