        "Ome sashers fate to rule the streets\nA game of death he must compete\nA piercing blade to the throat\nWill end the terror the knife invoked\nAn unknown soldier drew the line\nA mark of death he soon would find\nIn a twist of fate he could prevail\n...\n\n", 
        "I know you can't understand my words\nI bet you wish I had left\nI walk and fumble but I'm still causing trouble\nBecause I'm drunk as shit\nSorry that I pissed on your couch\nSometimes shit gets out of control\nThe last thing that I remember\nWas something kinda clever\n...\n\n",
