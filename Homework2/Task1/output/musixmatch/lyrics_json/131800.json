        "The first body we found little more than a dried up husk.\n\nIt hadn't been there for long.\nIt still had a full kit, ammo, rifle, half pack of cigarettes in the chest pocket.\nNo visible wounds.\nHis uniform was unfamiliar, not one of ours.\n\nLike us, he had no flag on his sleeve.\n\nI stuffed the cigarettes into my pocket and pulled its cap over its face.\nAbout as much ceremony as any of us deserved.\nWe got the signal to proceed and made our way deeper into the structure.\nIn the maze of hallways we found more bodies, dessicated, no wounds.\n\nAll dead without firing a shot.\n\nWe had no idea what we were dealing with.\nWe weren't the first to try.\nI put my wristwatch to my ear to make sure it was still ticking.\nIt's an old habit.\nWe hadn't been told where we're going or why.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "[Julian Modely:]\nI realized that this book was just the sort of thing I had been looking for. Upon these crumbling yellowed pages was the key to my revenge. No longer would I suffer their ridicule, ignorance, and prejudice. No longer would I rush quietly through the halls, desperate to avoid yet another encounter with their toothy insults and pointing fingers. Finally they will learn some respect! Finally, they would learn to submit to me, Julian Modely.\n\nI whispered the words, careful not to awaken my idiot room mate, Harold. \"Tibi, Magnum Innominandum, signa stellarum nigrarum et bufoniformis Sadoquae sigillum\". Nothing happened. I read them again, slightly louder, this time eliciting a tired groan from the slumbering fat-boy. I felt an almost imperceptible vibration in the air. A shudder shook the room. Then, before my wide eyes, Harold's flabby body levitated above his bed. His eyes popped open and his hands grasped outwards in half-woken panic. His eyes began to bulge. Some thing shown in the pale light, some sort of cloud enveloping him. It slowly took on more depth as Harold's body contorted and stiffened. Soon I could make out horrid claws, mandibles, and grotesque sucking appendages. Things had taken a turn for the better.\n\n[The summoned Abomination:]\nWho the fuck has woken us up?\nTheir death will be painful but quick\nLet us go back to sleep\nCease your whispering\nThis infernal noise must end\n\n[Julian Modely:]\nIt was me!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
