        "Now, when the world is shadowed and dark\nNow, when the sky is empty of stars\nNow, when the world is wrapped in sleep\nIn a quiet, endless, and deep\nIn the silence of the night\n\nFar off in the distance, a fire comes to life\nA flicker of a flame breaks through the dark\nBurning soft and bright, dancing with the light\nawakening the heavens and the earth\nFar across the ocean, a flame is rising high\nBreaking through the shadows and the dark\nShining in the night, rising with the light\nHere to wake the heavens and the earth\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Now let the day just slip away\nSo the dark night may watch over you\nThen the view silent, true\nIt embraces your heart and your soul, Nocturne\n\nNever cry, never sigh\nYou don't have to wonder why\nAlways be, always see\n...\n\n", 
        "Sailing, I am sailing\nHome again, 'cross the sea\nI am sailing, stormy wates\nTo be near you, to be free\n\nI am flying, I am flying\nLike a bird, 'cross the sky\n...\n\n", 
        "The water is wide, I can't cross o'er\nAnd neither have I wings to fly\nGive me a boat that can carry two\nAnd we shall sail, my love and I\n\nWhen love is gentle, and love is kind\nThe sweetest flower when first it's new\n...\n\n", 
        "When you're weary\nFeeling small\nWhen tears are in your eyes\nI will dry them all\n\nI'm on your side\nWhen times get rough\nAnd friends just can't be found\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When all is said and done, you are the only one (X2)\n\nShutters on the windows\nChains upon the door\nSleepless nights, been waiting for an answer\nDreams of Heaven falling\nPanic in the town\nLonely men with fingers on the future\nWhen all is said and done, you are the only one\n\n(Chorus)\nFollow on, for the open road is waiting\n...\n\n", 
        "Walking in the air, floating the sky...\nFloating in the air...\n\nWe're walking in the air\nWe're floating in the moonlit sky\nThe people far below are sleeping as we fly\n\nWe're holding very tight\nI'm riding in the midnight blue\nAnd finding I can fly so high above with you\n...\n\n", 
        "May it be an evening star,\nShines down upon you.\nMay it be as darkness falls,\nYour heart will be true.\nYou walk a lonely road;\nOh, how far you are from home...\n\nMornie ut\u00falie (darkness has come),\n...\n\n", 
        "I've met some folks\nWho say that I'm a dreamer\nAnd I've no doubt\nThere's truth in what they say\nBut sure a body's bound to be a dreamer\nWhen all the things he loves are far away.\n\nAnd precious things\nAre dreams unto an exile\nThey take him o'er\nThe land across the sea\nEspecially when it happens he's an exile\nFrom that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree.\n\nAnd when the moonlight\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear a baby crying\nA sad sound, a loney sound\nI want to take her in my arms\nAnd then I dry away all her tears\n\nI see a boy, who's frightened\nA young boy, with old eyes\nI long to say 'You're welcome here,\nYou can be happy now that you're warm'\n\nWe're all a part of one world\nWe all can share the same dream\nAnd if you just reach out to me\n...\n\n", 
        "Shule, shule, shule aroon\nShule go succir agus, shule go kewn,\nShule go durrus oggus aylig lume,\n\nShule, shule, shule aroon\nShule go succir agus, shule go kewn,\nShule go durrus oggus aylig lume,\nIss guh day thoo avorneen slawn.\n\nI wish I was on yonder hill\n\u2019Tis there I\u2019d sit and cry my fill,\nAnd every tear would turn a mill\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me sail, let me sail\nLet the Orinoco Flow\nLet me reach, let me beach\nOn the shores of Tripoli\nLet me sail, let me sail\nLet me crash upon your shore\nLet me reach, let me beach\nFar beyond the Yellow Sea\n\nDe, de\nDe, de\nDe, de\nDe, de\nDe, de\n\nSail away, sail away, sail away\nSail away, sail away, sail away\nSail away, sail away, sail away\nSail away, sail away, sail away\n\nFrom Bissau to Palau\nIn the shade of Avalon\nFrom Fiji to Tiree\n...\n\n", 
        "Someday, when we are wiser\nWhen the world's older\nWhen we have learned\nI pray someday we may yet\nLive to live and let live\n\nSomeday, life will be fairer\nNeed will be rarer\nAnd greed will not pay\nGodspeed, this bright millenia\nOn it's way, let it come someday\n\nSomeday our fight will be won, and\n...\n\n", 
        "Days and years praying for our love, our future\nSo silently kept inside our hearts so deeply\n\nTime went by, never changed and stayed inside us\n\nSo preciously, carrying all the love for you\n\nNo one ever would say a word 'bout the story we know\nNever let the legend vanish\nNo one ever would tell the truth, the secret we know\n...\n\n", 
        "When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary\nWhen troubles come and my heart burdened be\nThen, I am still and wait here in the silence\nUntil you come and sit awhile with me.\n\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas\nI am strong, when I am on your shoulders\nYou raise me up: To more than I can be.\n\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas\n...\n\n", 
        "Roses whisper \"goodnight\" 'neath the sil'vry light\nAsleep in the dew they hide from our view\nWhen the dawn peepeth through God will wake them and you\n...\n\n", 
        "Somewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high\nThere's a land that I heard of\nOnce in a lullaby\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nSkies are blue\nAnd the dreams that you dare to dream\n...\n\n", 
        "Sailing, sailing\n\nSomewhere beyond the sea\nSomewhere waiting for me\nMy lover stands on golden sands\nAnd watches the ships that go sailing\n\nSomewhere beyond the sea\nHe's there watching for me\nIf I could fly like birds on high\nThen straight to his arms I'd go sailing\n...\n\n", 
        "Many nights we've prayed\nWith no proof anyone could hear\nIn our hearts a hopefull song\nWe barely understood\n\nNow we are not afraid\nAlthough we know there's much to fear\nWe were moving mountains long\nBefore we knew we could\n\nThere can be miracles, when you believe\nThough hope is frail, it's hard to kill\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve\nWhen you believe, somehow you will\nYou will when you believe\n\nIn this time of fear\nWhen prayers so often prove(s) in vain\nHope seems like the summer birds\nToo swiftly flown away\n...\n\n", 
        "Goodnight my angel.\nTime to close your eyes.\nAnd save these questions for another day.\nI think I know what you've been asking me.\nI think you know what I've been trying to say.\nI promise I would never leave you.\nAnd you should always know, \nI never will be far away.\n...\n\n", 
        "High is the moon tonight\nHiding its guiding light\nHigh\n\nHeaven and earth do sleep\nStill in the dark so deep\nI will the darkness sweep\n\nI will the moon to flight\nI will the heavens bright\n...\n\n"
