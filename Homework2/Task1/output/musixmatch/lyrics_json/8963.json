        "Think I'm ready\nI think I've got it\nCause to much thinking is bad for my health\nIt's like a fire 'cause when I start it\nI can't control it and I burn myself\nBut I can't just sit here and watch it\nIf we don't stop it no one will\n\nWe are the ones, we are the guns\nAnd we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung\nWe are the change, we are the chains that hold us\nWe are the choice, we are the strong\nWe are one\n\nMy heart is racing, just like a rocket\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Watch me light the sky\nWatch me light the sky\n\nHands held high sweat dripping off me\nLight it softly, got these fakers trying to stop me\nThis ain't a hobby it's a way of life\nJust like Holyfield and Tyson, gloves on fight night\nBoom here comes the hurricane monsoon\nSwitched up, came to redecorate the room\nMy ears are ringing from hearing the same sound\nSo what now all of the walls just came down\nI blaze a trail like the rays from taillights\nSound shaking the ground like earthquakes hail might\nSomeday I'll die but not tonight\nExcuse me while I light up the sky\n\nWatch me light the sky\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "I'm just the boy inside the man, not exactly who you think I am\nTrying to trace my steps back here again, so many times\nI'm just a speck inside your head, you came and made me who I am\nI remember where it all began, so clearly\n\nI feel a million miles away, still you connect me in your way\nAnd you create in me, something I would've never seen\nWhen I can only see the floor, you made my window a door\nSo when they say they don't believe, I hope that they see you and me\nAfter all the lights go down, I'm just the words you are the sound\nA strange type of chemistry, how you've become a part of me\nAnd when I sit alone at night, your thoughts burn through me like a fire\nYou're the only one who knows, who I really am\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
