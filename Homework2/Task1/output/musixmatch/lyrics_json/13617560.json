        "We feel the rising sun release\nthe day to us, the dreamers.\nWe seize it in our hands\nand burn ourselves,\nWe know no better.\n\nDon't take me back\nif you don't want to.\nDon't take me back.\nI said, don't take me back\nif you don't want to.\nI won't come home,\nI won't come home.\nDon't take me back\nif you don't want to.\n\nWe felt the sun beat down the day\nwe gave ourselves to each other.\nAnd your heart broke like the dawn,\nbut I was blind to see the sunlight.\n\nDon't take me back\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "If you come around, if you come around again\nYou better not come in, better stay outside\nCause I can't hold my ground, I can't hold my ground I can't\nNot if you look me in, look me in my eye\n\nTiger in my heart again\nWhen you swallow someone whole, you are bound to choke\nWell, I guess we can never be friends\nI ate you up the day we first spoke\n\nDon't you call me on the telephone\nDon't make plans with my friends\nI think that it's best if you leave me alone\nWhen I'm with you I just want to play pretend\n\nIf you'd only take one step closer\nI could reach the zipper on your dress\nWe're leaning out over the water\nAnd we're holding our breath\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
