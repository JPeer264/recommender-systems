        "I follow the Moskva\nAnd down to Gorky Park\nListening to the wind of change\nAn August summer night\nSoldiers passing by\nListening to the wind of change\n\nThe world is closing in\nAnd did you ever think\nThat we could be so close, like brothers\nThe future's in the air\nCan feel it everywhere\nBlowing with the wind of change\n\nTake me to the magic of the moment\n...\n\n",

        "Welcome to a trip\nInto my hurt feelings\nTo the centre of my soul\nYou better bring a light\nTo find the house of meanings\nIn the labyrinth of yes or no\n\nFor you, life is just like chess\nIf you don't make a move\nYou'll lose the game like this\n\n'Cause you, you're walking on the edge\nYou, you chose the way of love and pain\nYou, don't you see the bridge\nI've built for you, it's just one step to start again\n\nWelcome to a trip\nInto my emotions\nTo the language of my heart\nYou're sailing on a river\n...\n\n", 
        "I was born from the sound of the strings\nFor someone to give everything\nTo be a song just for your feeling\n\nClose your eyes and I'll try to get in\nTo touching your heart like the sping\n'Cause I was born to touch your feelings\n\nSteal the time, take a song and be glad\nBe free as the birds, don't be sad\nYour time will come, I'll make you feel it\nYou're still young like the sun after rain\nFollow the light it's not in vain\nAnd you will see I'll touch your feelings\n...\n\n",
