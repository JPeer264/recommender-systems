        "I sweep across the land in vain,\nLike locust swarming in the breeze,\nI want for nothing yet I keep,\nExercising futility.\n\nSuccess is ashes on my tongue,\nRemain unhappy though I'm loved,\nI know I'm foolish and I'm young,\nBut can't you see it's not enough?\n\nI'm not satisfied,\nIt's all or nothing,\nThere's no peace of mind for me,\nAnd even though I try,\n...\n\n",

        "Look inside yourself\nYour soul is hollow\nYou live inside your hell\nYou're fake and shallow\nThe darkness fades to light\nI know you're always right\nBecause I belong to you\n...\n\n", 
        "It's just a question of time before I forget\nWho you are and what it was to me\nI can't pretend\nTo understand a thing\nWhat if it all comes back?\nIt's not what was expected but\nThere's no reason to keep holding on\nI feel contempt\nI feel regret\n...\n\n", 
        "I cannot sleep\nI cannot breath\nThe air is gone.\n\nAll i can see\nIs you is you\n\nSo time passes and i wait\nNothing comes to take me from this\n\nI dont believe\nso I ask so i ask...\n\nWhen tomorrow comes again\nWill I fall\nWill I face this world again\n...\n\n",
