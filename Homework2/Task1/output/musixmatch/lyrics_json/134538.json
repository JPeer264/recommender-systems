        "I lost my way when I jumped in the river\nThe girl repeats as she makes me shiver\nThe life she gave was mine you see\nThe trees, the knives, the blood, the leaves\nI come up for air as the rock gets thicker\nShe holds me down and my legs get stiffer\nThe cold, the sun, the dark, the river\nThe shiver, the mud, the black, forever\n\nAm I lost and found, am I lost and found\nAm I lost and found at the base of the river\nAm I lost and found, am I lost and found\nAm I lost and found at the base of the river\n\nI lost my way when I jumped in the river\nThe girl repeats as she makes me shiver\nThe life she gave was mine you see\nThe trees, the knives, the blood, the leaves\nI come up for air as the rock gets thicker\nShe holds me down and my legs get stiffer\nThe cold, the sun, the dark, the river\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
