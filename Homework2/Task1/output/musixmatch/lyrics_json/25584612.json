        "Realize\nCheck it out, yo\n\nEverything goes exactly as I predicted it\nThough minutiae is different, I nailed the gist of it\nJust failed to adjust, baby it was a bust\nAs I was saying craving blunts that bubba's started playing\nSomebody save us, I'm seeing futures\nSo what's the use of knowing the truth if no one's going to believe you?\nThe Curse of Cassandra\nMy vision eyes reveal all the answers and seem to leave no surprises\nTo live and die and circumscribe circumstances\nA paralyzing affair, trying's a fool's errand\nYou see what I'm saying?\nI'm sorry if it's scary or obtuse when you feel you're cruising in Doc's Delorean\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Spread love feel the vibe get buzzed.\nSpread. Spread.\nSpread love feel the vibe get buzzed.\n\nDon't think about getting over there's nothing above\nWhen my man says? Lift it up on a Thursday\nLet me hands work while the words play\nThese nerds dancing on my nerves\nMaybe you should seek some help\nSteady trying to live but just playing yourself\nGot a lot of angry and malice inside your heart kid\nSo it was already over before you started\nNow you're on the microphone soundin' retarded\nSleep walkin, talkin bout how you're a conscious artist\nI'm from the natty where they love to hate\nLand of the fake\nYou're just another crumb on the plate\nGettin' eatin' and served and keepin' my word\nWe're spreadin' the love\nBuy it to get it dub the beat is superb\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
