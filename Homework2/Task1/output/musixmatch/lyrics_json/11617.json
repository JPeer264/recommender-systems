        "Oh, so dark, inside my heart\nOh, so cold ...if you weren't so far away\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You opened my heart when you opened your eyes\nAnd I beheld the dawn of the hidden sky\nI felt a breeze, so gentle and mild\nAnd when I glanced the sunrise, then I knew I could fly\n\nOh, I see the sky, in your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish, I dream, a dream of mountains high\nWhere I can sit and look down hills, and say\n\" This is I\"\nI wish, I dream, a dream of mountains high\nWhere I can stand and raise my hands, and touch the sky\n\nA streak of light, opened in the darkness\n\"Little child, welcome to the outer realms\nThis is your kingdome, this is your destiny\"\nThat little child, that little child was me\n\n\"My son, you must wander far\nThere is a place, seek it skywards\n...\n\n", 
        "Closed the door to the world below\nWhere demons sleep and evil grows\nBut when night falls, and shadows grow long\nThey'll enter from the world of beyond\n\nWhen darkness clouds, they'll ride from the other side\n\nWhen the night comes, and daylight yields\nThey come to you, and haunt your dreams\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a land, a land of greater art\nBut high mountains hide its heart\nThe gods play there, a soft sound of harps\nAnd in the air shine silver stars\n\nThere is a land, a land that mountains guard\nA land for most mortals far\nBut if you pure in heart, the time will come to you\nWhen you may follow an avatar through\n\nBut here close the avatars words...\n\n\"Get your eagle wings, upon highest ground\nFill those wings with air and fly around\nSeek the lands, ride the winds\n...\n\n", 
        "Universal bond, we're all the same\nEvil man, not to be tamed\nOpen your mind, and you will find\nYou're just as evil, as evil as I\n\nThere's a little bit of evil, inside if you\n...\n\n", 
        "Shadows dance, in the moonlight\nA chanting dance, in the dark night\nA chanting hum, to summon the wind\nTo summon her, and the spell she brings\n\n\"Come now\", the wind calls\n\"Come into the netherworld\nCome now, come within\nInto the land of the cold blowing wind\"\n\nShe comes in the dark, a voice in her glimpse\n...\n\n", 
        "A thousand tears, tears in my eyes\nTears from my heart, from down deep inside\nFor now you are to fly, to fly far away\nFly to heaven's land, to where the angels stay\n\nAnd the night will even hide, hide those ravens that fly\n\nAngel wings, takes you ashore\nAngel heart, it opens the door\nOn your path, all evil has fied\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, so dark, inside my heart\nOh, so cold ...if you weren't so far away\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You opened my heart when you opened your eyes\nAnd I beheld the dawn of the hidden sky\nI felt a breeze, so gentle and mild\nAnd when I glanced the sunrise, then I knew I could fly\n\nOh, I see the sky, in your eyes\n...\n\n",

        "A road into shadows, on through haunted meadows\nA road so old, so dark, the trail where the damned walk\nAs only darkness cares, I choose to wander here\nA time to evil be, as death awaits me ...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you know what you fear of the ravens dark,\nDo you know what they hide, hide within their hearts?\nCan you see the sorrow within their eyes,\nCan you hear their cries, when the fiddle dies...\n\nMistletoe, friend of foe, so black upon the moor\nFallen leaves colored red\u200a\u2014\u200ablood of all the dead\nInto mist they\u2019ll take you soul, they\u2019ll take your heart\n...\n\n", 
        "The hour late, outside it's dark\nYou better stay inside now\nOr you may get caught in my wrath\n\nAnd I will send the demons\nYou'll run but you cannot hide\nAnd I will send all my minions\nTo haunt you ...\n\nOnly evil dreams you'll find\nEvil deamons by their side\n\nHowling winds, outside it's cold\nYou better lock your doors now\n...\n\n", 
        "Take me where the sweet water flows\nTake me where the winds of spring blow\n\nAs swaying as tide, bitter and sweet combined\nI close my eyes ...\nNothing to fear, there is no evil near\nOnly you and me\n...\n\n", 
        "Past the forest of the flies of fire\nBeyond the waters of shimmering tears\nBy a fire they stand\nAnd they whisper my name\n\nNow I seek upon the night\nSmall fragments of moonlight\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sleeping twilight, slumber shall divide\nBeware the moon mans hypnotizing eye\nSpheres of silver, lit upon the sky\nShort is the time ...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Burn beacon fires, blow horns of doom\nSinister ascendancy, death's coming soon\n\nWe shall take the fire everywhere\nAnd all our enemies shall burn, yeah\nIn the fire they all shall die ...\n\nAnd like the dragons we shall reign\nReign in fire, reign in flames\nWe bring the fire where we turn\nBurn fire burn\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I still dream of the mountains, where I used to be a king\nKing of all the outer realms, how I wish to return...\n\n\"Welcome back, my son, I have waited for a long time\nWaited for the king to return, I have something to show you\nUpon the highest mountain, way up by the horizon\nLies an ancient path, the path of the gods...\"\n\nI've climbed the mountains high\nAnd walked among the clouds\nI've reached the outer realms\nSeen past the fields of wildgrown flowers\n\n\"Seek the opening of sanguine painted clouds\nCarried gently upon caressing winds\nThere by the boundaries of seldom broken lines\nLies the way...\"\n...\n\n"
