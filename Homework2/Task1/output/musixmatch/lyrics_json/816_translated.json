        "It wouldn't be so bad if it were over\nCause when she's gone I surely feel the need\nSomeday to walk right out and start all over but she never altogether leaves\n\nBeing by myself is not so bad right now\n...\n\n", 
        "He came home from working late again to a table set with candles for two\nAnd by a dying flame he hung his head in shame he forgot that she needs him too\nHe finds a note she left for him it said she can't do this anymore\nYou've done it again when will it end and who are you really working for\nDon't wait till it's too late it's too late for roses\n...\n\n", 
        "I knew she was the one the second I feel in love\nLike a pocket on a shirt she fit me like a glove\nThere's nothing I wanted more than for her to be my wife\nBut it scared me to think of taking on another life\nIt was the longest night before our wedding day\nI wasn't having second thoughts I just had more prayers to say\n...\n\n", 
        "Seasons come and seasons go summer nights to winter snow\nBut even time could never change the love I have for you\nI've been rich and I've been poor I've done with less but never more\nCause I have never been in love like I'm in love with you\n...\n\n", 
        "It's been too long ago there's so much we don't know\nIt's been years since I've been this close to you\nStanding here on the street like strangers when we meet\nOh God knows it's been too long ago\n\nI won't try to lie to you cause time just won't let us\n...\n\n", 
        "I know you're a woman a sensitive kind\nA fairy-tale princess with hearts on your mind\nWho needs to be showered with candy and flowers\nAnd told that you're loved all the time\nI know you need kisses and hugs every day\nPhone calls and letters whenever I'm away\n...\n\n", 
        "Do I love you more than mere words could ever say\nAm I crazy to think that I could find another way\nDo I need to tell you I'll always be true do I well darlin' I do\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes I find myself just sittin' all alone and wondering\nTryin' hard to figure out my life and what it means\nIt's not the things I never got the chance to do that matter\nIt's the things I took the chance to do that matter most to me\nI've had a good time had a good life had a good home had a good wife\nHad a little rain had a little sun had a little sin I had a little fun\nI've been up on cloud nine been down on my luck\n...\n\n", 
        "(Don Reid)\n\nWedding invitations, long receiving line\nA veil that covered your face, a smile that covered mine\nThe honeymoon in New York, the stressed-out credit card\nThe Cape Cod on the corner, the two kids in the yard.\n\nIt should've been you, it should've been me\nIt should've been the way things turned out to be\nIt could've been now, it could've been how\nWe both dreamed that it would be.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Look at me you can't even look at me\nI don't know what happened to what we used to be\nLook at me you can't even look at me\nHow can you say you love me you can't even look at me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She was standin' in the crowd\nAll alone and lookin' pretty\nListening to the music that we played\nShe walked up and whispered\nI leaned down and listened\nTo the request that she made\n\n\"Do you know you are my sunshine?\u201d\nShe asked so sweet and tenderly\n\"Do you know you are my sunshine?\nAnd would you do it one more time for me\"\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish I had a dollar\nFor every time I was unkind\nI wish I'd had an answer\nFor all the questions on her mind\n\nI wish I'd had the time\nFor all the times she needed me\nI wish I'd realized\nBut I was much too blind to see\n\nAll she wanted was to love me\nBut all I did was turn away\nIf I'd known how much she needed me\nShe might be here today\n...\n\n", 
        "Never heard a snowman talking\nNever seen a reindeer fly\nNor seen a wooden soldier walking\nNor met Santa eye to eye\n\nNow there are those who don't believe\nIn miracles or Santa Claus\nBut I believe what I believe\nAnd I believe in Santa's cause\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll be home for Christmas\nYou can count on me\nPlease have snow and mistletoe\nAnd presents on the tree\nChristmas Eve will find me\n...\n\n", 
        "Dashing through the snow\nIn a one horse open sleigh\nO'er the fields we go\nLaughing all the way\n\nBells on Bob-tails ring\nMaking spirits bright\nWhat fun it is to ride and sing\nA sleighing song tonight\n\nJingle bells\n(Jingle bells, jingle bells)\nJingle bells\n(Jingle bells, jingle bells)\nJingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride\nIn a one horse open sleigh\n\nJingle bells\n(Jingle bells, jingle bells)\n...\n\n", 
        "The year you were Snow Queen at the high school Christmas ball\nThe night we got snowed in and prayed it wouldn't thaw\nThe year I bought your bracelet and you bought me one too\nI never spend a Christmas that I don't think of you.\n\nThe year I helped your daddy trim the outdoor tree with lights\n...\n\n", 
        "Christmas to me is wherever she might be\nSinging carols with the choir, hanging stocking by the fire\nMaking Christmas bows, hanging mistletoe\n'Cause where she is I wanna be, that's what Christmas is to me\n\nChristmas to me is as far as I can see\nPasture fields covered with snow, White Christmas on the radio\nChildren in sleighs and mama's ginger bread\n...\n\n", 
        "There are people who are whispering\nAnd the rumors are running wild\nThere's a woman who's not married\nBut she's gonna have a child\n\nHer name is Mary, she's a virgin\nFrom down in Nazareth, now listen close\nShe's gonna marry a man named Joseph\nBut the baby's father is The Holy Ghost\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Away in a manger\nNo crib for a bed\nThe little Lord Jesus\nLaid down His sweet head\n\nThe stars in the bright sky\nLooked down where He lay\nThe little Lord Jesus\nAsleep on the hay\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The greatest Christmas present\nIs something you can't buy\n\nWhen World War 2 was over\nWe trimmed the tree alone,\nBut we saved the star for Daddy\nCause Daddy was coming home\n\nWe bought Momma a new dress\nWe bought Daddy a tie,\nBut he brought us each something\nThat money couldn't buy\nThe greatest christmas present\n...\n\n", 
        "About three nights before every Christmas\nWe'd load Mr. Bradley's truck with hay\n7: 30 on the dot, on the church parking lot\nWe'd pile in that old truck and ride away\n\nJust a bunch of kids singin' Christmas carols\nTo the hospital and the old folks home\nSometimes we'd go in and sing 'em all again\nTo a shut-in who was livin' all alone\n\nSingin' Joy to the world, the Lord is come\n...\n\n"
