        "Raindrops on roses whiskers on kittens\nBright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens\nBrown paper packages tied up with string\nThese are a few of my favorite things\n\nCream colored ponies and crisp apple streudel\nDoorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles\nWild geese that fly with the moon on their wings\nThese are a few of my favorite things\n\nGirls in white dresses with blue satin sashes\nSnowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "My blue horizon is turning grey\nAnd my dreams are drifting away\n\nYour eyes don't shine like they used to shine\nAnd the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine\nI'm afraid the masquerade is over\nAnd so is love, and so is love\n\nYour words don't mean what they used to mean\nThey were once inspired, now they're just routine\nI'm afraid the masquerade is over\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "They say \nInto your early life romance came \nAnd in this heart of yours burned a flame \nA flame that flickered one day \nAnd died,\nAway\nThen\nWith disilutions deep in your eyes \n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "La, la la la...\nThis is just a little samba\nBuilt upon a single note\nOther notes are bound to follow\nBut the root is still that note\n\nNow this new note is the consequence\nOf the one we've just been through\nAs I'm bound to be the unavoidable\nConsequence of you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
