        "Filled with sorrow\nBleak inner self touched by pride\nDevoured by solitude, still wrapped in time\nFlowing pain\n\nHolding myself back in suspicion\nAnd lingering in the dust\nThe dust of my abandoned remains\nKilled with the dagger of life!\n\nSuch an exquisite pride in my suffering\nAlone, all alone with the emotional\nStreams of my soul\nSo real, so pure, yet I'm left aside\nEntangled in fear, without hope\n\nRaped by the light of the world\nScorned, left behind and broken down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

I know that light is not for me.\n\nLost in a dead world...\nWith broken wings!\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
