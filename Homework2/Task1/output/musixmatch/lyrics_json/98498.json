        "I walk the lone the path of the samurai\nLeisure is granted with each of the planets that I have seized and ravaged to gratify\nMy beastliness power ingenious now you get redevoured\nI reap and shower you each with flours and peace and powder\nTo me its dirt for the weak to crowd or elite to cower\nEither way i'll just keep you down with my ether now or, later\nYou get faced with a hopeless ultimatum\nA culmination of everyone dope im all amazing\nAssault with patience and accurate brutal force\nYou're average and new to war\nI've mastered the Q's and P's of these tracks that I do record\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
