        "When you think you've found something\nWorth holding on to\nWere you reaching for attention\nHoping she would notice you?\n\nCollecting bottles and thrown away cans\nLike she was returnable\nOne day would refill your hands\nHow she loved you, all you imagined\nFit so well into your plan\n\nMaybe one day soon it will all come out\nHow you dream about each other sometimes\nWith the memory of how you once gave up\n...\n\n", 
        "This morning under awaking glow\nThe sun filled our room like December snow\nLike morning through an old window\nThere's a place in your head I will always know\n\nTo the same world born two of a kind\nIf it's on your mind, it'll be on mine 'cause\nI know you well\n\nLike the soil in the ground\nGrass grown in the shadow of a bell\nAnd if the bell will never toll\nYou and me grow old\nI hope we'll live to tell\nHow you know I know you knew I know you well\n...\n\n", 
        "I wanna sink to the bottom with you\nI wanna sink to the bottom with you\nThe ocean is big and blue\nI just wanna sink to the bottom with you\n\nCars on the highway, planes in the air\nEveryone else is going somewhere\nBut I'm going nowhere, getting there soon\nI might as well just sink down with you\n\nI wanna sink to the bottom with you\nI wanna sink to the bottom with you\n...\n\n", 
        "Midnight, on the water\nI saw the ocean's daughter\nWalking on a wave she came\nStaring as she called my name.\n\nAnd I can't get it out of my head\nNo, I can't get it out of my head\nNow my whole world is gone for dead\n'Cause I can't get it out of my head.\n\nBreakdown, on the shoreline\nCan't move, it's an ebb tide\n...\n\n", 
        "She's wearing kid gloves\nWill handle me carefully\nCause I've got a history, cracked up and fragile\nAnd bound to break easy\n\nAnd if she could talk to me\nWhat good would it do me\nIt's no secret where I've been and I have worn so thin\nAnd she can see through me\n\nCHORUS 1:\nI don't believe a word of it\n...\n\n", 
        "Are you alone now\nDid you lose the monkey\nHe gave you backaches\nNow you slouch\n\nHe didn't mean it\nWas just a dumb ape\nReading Playboy\nOn your couch\n\nAnd now it's time to say\nWhat I forgot to say\nBaby, baby, baby,\nC'mon what's wrong\nIt's a radiation vibe\nI'm groovin' on\nDon't it make you wanna get some sun\nShine on, shine on, shine on\n\nI went to Pittsburgh\n...\n\n", 
        "Gold sunglasses and a wandering eye\nHe looks like he's wearing a cheap disguise\nBut it's real\nDon't you know how it feels?\n\nHe goes to work and he scares the hell\nOut of all the girls down in Oradell\nWhat a deal\nDon't you know how it feels?\n\nLay it down, lay it down\nYou've got to cover a lot of ground\n...\n\n", 
        "Bah bah bah bah bah da da da da\nBah bah bah da da da\nBah bah bah bah bah da da da da\nBah bah bah da da da\n\nWelcome friends to Janice's Party\nThe kind that others have tried\nSmoking is permitted inside\n\nWe have faith in Janice's Party\nWith friends who can not sing\nAnd I can hear the doorbell ring\n...\n\n", 
        "The day you drew your final breath\nAnd parted from the Earth\nIs carved into the stone that bears your name\nAnd date of birth\n\n...\n\n"
