        "Four walls and a cauldron of Kalashnikoving\nAnd our home is a trigger that I'm always pulling\nAt the border, at the, at the border\nI'm at the border at the, at the border\nThe short spears and the weak eternal monologuing\nAnd our war is the crucible of all your longing\nAt the border, at the, at the border\nI'm at the border at the, at the border\n\nI was there when the clamour got real\nI was there when your brow smashed the wall\nIt's like a riot with only two perps\nThe more I'm here I'm making it worse\nBut does it feel like you're already dead? (Yes!)\nAnd do you feel like your brain stopped delivering?\nYeah break my finger shoot out my black eyes\nWhat does it matter if everyone dies?\n\n(Hey!)\nHey Kemosabe I'm alone!\nI am a!\nI am alone!\n(Hey!)\nHey Kemosabe I'm alone!\nI am a!\nI am alone!\nHi-O Silver away!\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)", 
        "What's in the rucksack, Jon?\nScalps for my pretty wife\nWhere did you get them from?\nCame with my hunting knife\nSo have you killed someone?\nPlease tell me how to sleep\nYou look so crazy hounded\nMe or my enemies?\nCall me\nWhen I'm sleeping, you're sorry\nMoaning on, you so worried\nAnd how you're bored of this wasteland\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
