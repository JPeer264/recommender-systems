        "Your eyes are like burned-out headlights\nA little thunder in the night\nI'm losin' you\nYou're walking around like you live a graveyard\nGet you the one with the cards\nI'm losin' you\n\nI guess I'll go\nAnd I'll lock the door behind me\nWhat's it for\nWhen you've only got time\nYou gotta leave behind?\n\nYou nod and smile like a lying stranger\nWhen I ask if you're doing all right\n...\n\n", 
        "skinny boy, all bones no lies\nyou're so miserable in the mornings\nwill you will wait up for me?\nit's sordid and I can't find my feet\nand you've got lips I could spend a day with.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Come along, Ruby\nWhere have you gone?\nYou've got eyes like the North Dakota sun\nGot lips like an ocean and skin like the rain\nWhole lot of whisky and wine and propane.\n\nTook me to Nashville to sing with the band\nAnd then you left me in Tulsa sleepin' in the van\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby, baby, since you've been gone\nI ain't doing so good\nI don't get up, paint my face\nAnd go out like I should\n\nBaby, you turned a clear night sky\nInto a dark, dark hole\nAnd when I see a sunset now\nI'm just looking at a painting in a cheap motel\n\nBaby, I'm going on without you\nMaybe I'm even gonna get through\nBut baby, I'll tell you something\nThat'll never be true\nBaby, I'll get over you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My head's all filled with memories\nAnd yesterday is on her knees\nI'm stuck inside the sleepy web\nWhen I'm led into a deeper blue\n\nThere's cash stashed up in the hills\nA flood of mud and dollar bills\n...\n\n", 
        "Man made moons, they go on, one by one\nWhen the sun is done for the day\nThat's when the girls come by through the silver blinds\nWe'll watch the drinking, lie on the pavement\n...\n\n", 
        "It's too cold by the window\nand too hot by the fire\n\nThe porch light is burnt out\nand the sky looks tired\n\nIt's all wrong while your gone\nIt's all wrong while your gone\n\nThe bedroom is like a Monday and the phone is my only song\n\nThe nights a broken radio even the dogs face is long\n\nIt's all wrong while your gone\nIt's all wrong while your gone\n...\n\n", 
        "Today I'm sinkin' lower\nThan the sun does on a Sunday\nAnd I look around but you're nowhere\nAnd I don't know if I can pick up\nBecause when I wake up you're still gone\n\nAnd all the water in you\nIs putting out the fire in me\nAnd all the miles\nHave no sympathy\n\nThen tomorrow comes\n...\n\n",
