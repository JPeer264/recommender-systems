        "Half past twelve\nAnd I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone\nHow I hate to spend the evening on my own\nAutumn winds\nBlowing outside the window as I look around the room\nAnd it makes me so depressed to see the gloom\n\nThere's not an owl out there\nsomeone to hear my pray\n\nGimme gimme gimme a man after midnight\nWon't somebody help me chase the shadows away\nGimme gimme gimme a man after midnight\nTake me through the darkness to the break of the day\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
