Who's been fooling who?\n\nThere you sit there, looking so cool\nWhile the whole show is passing you by.\nYou better come to terms with your fellow men soon, cause...\n\nThe whole world is shaking now. Can't you feel it?\nA new dawn is breaking now. Can't you see it?\n\nTell the truth. Tell me who's been fooling you\nTell the truth. Who's been fooling who?\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah\n\nGot to find me a way to take me back to yesterday\nHow can I ever hope to forget you?\nShow me a place where I can hide my lonely face\nI know you're going to break my heart if I let you, oh yeah\n\nWhy does love got to be so sad?\nWhy does love got to be so sad?\nWhy does love got to be so sad?\nWhy does love got to be so sad?\n\nLike a moth to a flame, like a song without a name\nI've never been the same since I met you\nLike a bird on the wing, got a brand new song to sing\nI can't keep from singing about you, oh\n\n...\n\n",
