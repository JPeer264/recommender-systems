        "I can't light no more of your darkness\nAll my pictures seem to fade to black and white\nI'm growing tired and time stands still before me\nFrozen here on the ladder of my life\n\nIt's much too late to save myself from falling\nI took a chance and changed your way of life\nBut you misread my meaning when I met you\nClosed the door and left me blinded by the light\n\nDon't let the sun go down on me\n...\n\n", 
        "I know it's late\nBut I couldn't wait to call you on the phone\nit's been a while since I've been at home\nAll of this was my own choice\nSince the man upstairs has given me this voice\nNo matter how long it takes\nNo matter how hard the breaks\nI've gotta use it!\nOr lose it!\nI just can't stand to refuse\nA chance to do what I've gotta do\nI've got to sing my song\n\nSing the hatred into love\nSing a praise, to heaven 'bove\nSing the tears, into a smile ye-aaaah\nSing into a feeling\nThis is all worthwhile\n...\n\n", 
        "You can reach me by railway\nyou can reach me by trailway\nYou can reach me on an airplane\nyou can reach me with your mind\nYou can reach me by caravan\ncross the desert like an Arab man\nI don't care how you get here\njust get here if you can\n\nYou can reach me by sailboat\nclimb a tree and swing rope to rope\nTake a sled and slide down slow\ninto these arms of mine\nYou can jump on a speedy colt\n...\n\n",
