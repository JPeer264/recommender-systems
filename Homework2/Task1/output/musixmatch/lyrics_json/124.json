        "She took my father from my life oh\nTook my sister and brothers oh\nI watched her torturing my child\nFeeble I was then but now I'm grown\n\nFire on Babylon\nOh yes a change has come\nFire on Babylon\nFire\nFire\nFire\n\nShe's taken everything I liked\nShe's taken every lover oh\nAnd all along she gave me lies\nJust to make me think I loved her\n\nFire on Babylon\n...\n\n", 
        "John I love you\nI'm ever so fond of you\nWill you wait for me\nTill I am heavenly\nOh there's much work to do\nBut I love you\n\nOh you're tender\nYour name's a whisper\n\nI let tears fall like rain\nApple-sized they were\nAll over her\nAnd through all of those times\nWhen you could have died\nThis is what you find\n...\n\n", 
        "My darling child\nMy darling baby\nMy darling child\nYou gave life to me\n\nMy darling child\nMy darling baby\nMy darling child\nYou came and saved me\n\nMy darling child\nMy darling baby\n...\n\n", 
        "Am I a human\n\nIt's very good\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm not no red football to kicked around the garden\nNo no\nI'm a red christmas tree ball, and I'm fragile\nI'm not no animal, though I am to you\nI'm not no crocodile, like the one in Dublin Zoo\nWho lived in a cage the length and breadth of his body\nWith a window people would look through\nAnd throw coins on his back and taunt him though he couldn't move\nEven if he wanted to\n\n...\n\n", 
        "What else should I be\nAll apologies\nWhat else should I say\nEveryone is gay\nWhat else could I write\nI don't have the right\nWhat else should I be\nAll apologies\n\nIn the sun\nIn the sun I feel as one\nIn the sun\nIn the sun\n...\n\n", 
        "A Perfect Indian is he\nRemembering him life is sweet\nLike a weeping willow\nHis face on my pillow\nComes to me still in my dreams\n\nAnd there I saw a young baby\nA beautiful daughter was she\nA face from a painting\nRed cheeks and teeth aching\nHer eyes like a wild Irish sea\n...\n\n", 
        "See the child\nWith the golden hair\nYet eyes that show the emptiness inside\nDo we know\nCan we understand just how he feels\nOr have we really tried\nSee him now\nAs he stands alone\nAnd watches children play a children's game\nSimple child\nHe looks almost like the others\nYet they know he's not the same\nScorn not his simplicity\nBut rather try to love him all the more\n...\n\n", 
        "All babies are born saying God's name\nOver and over,\nAll born singing God's name\nAll babies are flown from the Universe\nFrom there they're lifted by the hands of angels\nGod gives them the stars to use as ladders\nShe hears their calls\nShe is mother and father\nAll babies are born out of great pain\nOver and over\nAll born into great pain\nAll babies are crying\n...\n\n", 
        "In this heart lies for you\nA lark born only for you\nWho sings only to you\nMy love\nMy love\nMy love\n\nI am waiting for you\nFor only to adore you\nMy heart is for you\nMy love\n...\n\n"
