        "This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the\nrestaurant, but Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant,\nthat's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the song Alice's\nRestaurant.\n\nYou can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant\nYou can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant\nWalk right in it's around the back\nJust a half a mile from the railroad track\nYou can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant\n\nNow it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on - two years ago on\nThanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the\nrestaurant, but Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the\nchurch nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and\nFasha the dog. And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of\nroom downstairs where the pews used to be in. Havin' all that room,\nseein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't\nhave to take out their garbage for a long time.\n\nWe got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be\na friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump. So\nwe took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW\nmicrobus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed\non toward the city dump.\n\nWell we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the\ndump saying, \"Closed on Thanksgiving.\" And we had never heard of a dump\nclosed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off\ninto the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.\n\nWe didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the\nside road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the\ncliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile\nis better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we\ndecided to throw our's down.\n\nThat's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving\ndinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the\nnext morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie. He said, \"Kid,\nwe found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of\ngarbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it.\" And\nI said, \"Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope\nunder that garbage.\"\n\nAfter speaking to Obie for about fourty-five minutes on the telephone we\nfinally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down\nand pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the\npolice officer's station. So we got in the red VW microbus with the\nshovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the\npolice officer's station.\n\nNow friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at\nthe police station, and the first was he could have given us a medal for\nbeing so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and\nwe didn't expect it, and the other thing was he could have bawled us out\nand told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again,\nwhich is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station\nthere was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was\nboth immediately arrested. Handcuffed. And I said \"Obie, I don't think I\ncan pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on.\" He said, \"Shut up, kid.\nGet in the back of the patrol car.\"\n\nAnd that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the\nquote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of\nStockbridge, Massachusets, where this happened here, they got three stop\nsigns, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the\nScene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars,\nbeing the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to\nget in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of\ncop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer's station.\nThey was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and\nthey took twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles\nand arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each\none was to be used as evidence against us. Took pictures of the approach,\nthe getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to\nmention the aerial photography.\n\nAfter the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was going to put\nus in the cell. Said, \"Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your\nwallet and your belt.\" And I said, \"Obie, I can understand you wanting my\nwallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you\nwant my belt for?\" And he said, \"Kid, we don't want any hangings.\" I\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
