        "Hey, I'm sorry if I go too fast\nTonight, let's pretend that this will last\nI've got a dream you would like to sleep until\n\nOh, I'm sorry to dwell on the past\nI'd better say nothing at all\nBut I've got this friend who thinks he's in love with you\nAnd it doesn't sum it up to say he's singing the blues\nAnd whoever learnt to walk in somebody else's shoes?\nHe's screaming because he's found something to lose\n...\n\n", 
        "La la la la la la la-la\nLa la la la la la la-la-la\nLa la la la la la la-la\nLa la la la la la la-la-la\n\nHeads or tails once I forget\nI'm trying to master a new alphabet\nFar too obliging to ever admit\nI've never been keen on this 'here boy' and 'sit'\n\nI don't want that ghost coming back again\nYou will play fair\nFor when I say that this is double or quits\nI double and stay-ay-ay\n\nOne fine day, there must be someone saying, I can say\nWith truth in my heart\nNo sub-clauses in the way, and now make a start.\n\nThe devil always has the finest tunes,\nBut of course it's always over much too soon.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a door we all walk through\nAnd on the other side I'll meet you\nReunion in the air - A cappella meets pure prayer\nSomewhere: I can't wait to meet you there\nSomewhere: I can't wait to meet you there\nIf there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight\nThey never sang doo-wop in Harlem\nIf there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "An outlaw stand in a peasant land\nIn every face see Judas\nThe burden of love is so strange\nThe stubborn beast and the whiskey priest\n\nAre hiding from the captains\nThe burden of love is so plain\nAre they happy to see you? No\nYou always bring trouble\n\nCast a shadow on Mexico, denial doesn't change facts\nLike most I'll come when I want things done\nPlease God don't let that change\nThe anguish of love at long range\n...\n\n", 
        "Some expressions take me back\nLike hair of gold and sweet Mary\nAnd running to me\nThe sweet sweet songs that cloud your eyes\nNostalgia supplies\nLoreto Highstreet buried me\nBeneath the oak tree\n\nAs this is to me\nThen so to you is something else\nThat keeps you up long past your bedtime, tearing hair\n\nThe sweetest moment comes at last\nThe waitings over\n...\n\n", 
        "It's much more beguiling, than children at play.\nThe mind meets dilemma, with a heart in decay.\nHow they reconcile art with... what was I going to say?\nI called because you're in a position to help.\nWith a limited talent, but impossible wealth.\nHow they reconcile love with...\nIt sure is a problem... but don't go away.\nCool critique of new gomorrah, or schoolboy crush on che guevara,\nFace yourself or... give it away.\n...\n\n", 
        "Cruel is the Gospel thats sets us all free\nThen takes you away from me\nThere is no Chicago urban blues\nMore heartfelt than my lament for you\nI'm a liberal guy, too cool for the macho ache\nWith a secret tooth for the cherry on the cake\nWith a pious smile, a smile that changes what I say\nWhile I waste my time in regretting\nThat the days went from perfect to just okay\nLordy, what would I do? Don't call me possessive\nBut God if he's smoochin' with you\nI's a jealous boy root, the world should be free\nBut don't you go following suit, my heart is aligned\nIt couldn't be neutral, I couldn't be that way inclined\n...\n\n", 
        "Bo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo\nBo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo\n\nI couldn't bear to be special\nI couldn't bear\nCouldn't bear\nI couldn't bear\nRight?\n\nBo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo\n\nSo, don't look at me and say\nThat I'm the very one\nWho makes the cornball things occur\nThe shiver of the fur\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm not looking to disturb you,\njust a little to unnerve you.\ni have nothing about games\nand always looking back.\nafter the last unholy row\ni never, ever play basketball now.\nit joins a list of things i'll miss\nlike fencing foils and lovely girls\ni'll never kiss.\nLeave it behind on an overcrowded desk\n...\n\n", 
        "Sitting alone when her work is through,\nthese days she's listless though that spring sky is blue.\nHer parents try but it's not much use.\nHer boyfriend left home, it was late Summertime,\nlife was good, they were young, but glory is purblind,\nhow could a future like that go wrong?\nI know the Mayor of this hysterical town,\n...\n\n", 
        "There are those who own, the world around your own.\nAnd say you want to swan - one to one - Hey kid they own the pond.\nThere are those who rest, and those who make the beds,\nand should you seek redress - can't you guess? Hey child they own this mess.\nSo if these star-dust memories, fail to please,\nif you confuse this dinner dance with elegance,\n...\n\n", 
        "12345/12345... 12345/12345\nHer husband works in Jodrell Bank, he's home late in the morning,\nhad he been a lawyer, he wouldn't work for pennies.\nIn the morning I go walking, it helps the hurting soften,\nI've seen a lot of places, 'cos I miss her very often.\n...\n\n", 
        "An outlaw stand in a peasant land\nIn every face see Judas\nThe burden of love is so strange\nThe stubborn beast and the whiskey priest\n\nAre hiding from the captains\nThe burden of love is so plain\nAre they happy to see you? No\nYou always bring trouble\n\nCast a shadow on Mexico, denial doesn't change facts\nLike most I'll come when I want things done\nPlease God don't let that change\nThe anguish of love at long range\n...\n\n", 
        "Go, go, go\nGo, go, go\nGo, go, go\nGo, go, go\n\nPut your sweet lips a little closer to the phone\nLet's pretend that we're together all alone\nI'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low\nAnd you can tell your friend there with you\nHe'll have to go (go, go go)\n...\n\n", 
        "It's hard to act so simply\nIt's easy to make noise\nI worship the silence that sings like a bird\nI long for the moon as it looks from the earth\nBut to have and to hold it I'd only suggest\n...\n\n"
