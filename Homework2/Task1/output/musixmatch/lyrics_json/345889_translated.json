        "The time for execution, a harrowing display\nFor treachery upon the seas has taken place this day\nYour final hour has begun,\nWe\u2018ve all agreed your end has come\nWe\u2018ll take your sword, we\u2018ll take your gun - it\u2018s time\nFor you to come undone\nBe aware, what lies beneath\nRazor sharp and pointy teeth\nWalk the Plank!\nWith your life, you\u2018ll pay the price\nWalk the Plank!\nBoots of lead, your blood runs red\n...\n\n", 
        "The snow fell hard on a frozen sea\nAs the night swarmed all around\nWith no moon to guide our passage north\nThis corpse of mine may never be found\nThirty days, into this dead mans quest\nIn search of riches in a time-lost treasure chest\nThrough oceans never seen, through fog as thick as night\nTo the northern wastelands, onwards we must fight\nFar beyond the ice and snow\nOur voyage carries on\nFor blood and gold, we sold our souls\n...\n\n", 
        "Sailing the raging seas\nTo distant lands unknown\nPorto Bello fell in a day\nNow Britannia rules the waves\nThirty thousand men at arms\nRed Ensign in the sky\nTo Cartagena we set sail\nWith blood and plunder we\u2018ll prevail\nTwice struck, and twice we\u2018ve failed\nBut third time works a charm\nThe greatest fleet the world has seen\nTo fight the War of Jenkins\u2018 Ear\nWaters lash across the bow\nThrough Caribbean Seas\nThe year is 1741\nThe final battle has begun\nThe skies are burning with thunder\nThe seas are ablaze with flame\nSet the course for Cartagena\nThe sands of time will remember our names\nThe skies are burning with thunder\n...\n\n", 
        "Under the sea, there\u2018s a colony of bees\nAnd a man named Fred who will shoot you dead\nIf you try to steal from his apiary sealed\nWith magic spells at the gate to hell\nHe\u2018ll kill you in your sleep\nIf you so much as take a single peek\nSet sail across the waves\nWhere we will stop no man can say\nThe alcohol stores are running low\nSo into the deep blue yonder go\nSet sail across the waves\n...\n\n", 
        "I know a place at the edge of a land\nWhere the grass runs out and turns into sand\nI know a place where a man can stand\nBut a man cant walk in the sea\nI know a place where a man cant go\nWhere a man would drown and sink below\nBut if you have a ship then you should know\nYou can come with me\n\nCome with me on a quest!!\n...\n\n", 
        "I got a hangover\nI've been drinking too much for sure\nI got a hangover\nI got an empty cup, pour me some more\nSo I can go until they close up\nAnd I can drink until I throw up\nAnd I don't ever ever want to grow up\nI wanna keep it going, keep keep it going\nI got a little bit trashed last night\nI got a little bit wasted\nI got a little bit mashed last night\nI got a little shit faced-ed\nI'm on a ship\nIf you don't know\nWell now you know\nI got a hangover\nI've been drinking too much for sure\nI got a hangover\n...\n\n", 
        "First light reflects off the ocean\nAll crew now set into motion\nAnother day like many before it\nHard life, no way to ignore it\nBehold! A cry from the crow's nest\nA ship appears from the south west\nThe years below deck that bored me\nAll lead to what lies before me\n\nHear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound\nFate awaits me - As the vessels circle round\nSee the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire\n...\n\n", 
        "A ship approaches off the starboard bow\nThe time has come to fight, the time to strike is now\nReload the cannons, and sharpen up your swords\nThey will regret the day they faced the pirate horde\n\nWho will survive no-one can tell\nCome on, lets give 'em hell\n\nTerror on the High Seas\n...\n\n", 
        "A dreaded curse - Is spoken of\nBy all men of the sea - An ancient tale\nOf pirate's woe - And sailor's tragedy\n\nA map was drawn - By grizzled men\nForgotten years ago - A chest of glory\nAnd mortal sin - The none should ever know\n\nAnd they searched and they searched\nAnd they searched and they searched\nFor forbidden treasure old\nAnd this curse, and this curse,\n...\n\n", 
        "When I come back from a mighty quest\nI have no need for sleep or rest\nI head to a tavern for a drink\nAnd get so drunk I cannot think\nA wench by my side and a jug of mead\nThese are the things that I most need\nSo I sit back and sing this song\nAnd drink and party all night long\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Legend speaks of a beast\nThree hundred miles from it's tip to it's tail\nNone have seen it, yet all know it's name\nLike the ark of the covenant, or the holy grail\n\nWe set out on a quest\nIn search of the lair, where the creature doth dwell\nOn a ransom to bring back it's head\nOur journey would take us to the depths of hell\n\nHis eyes shine like the rays of morning\nHis mouth is as a burning flame\n\nLeviathan\nCresting the waves\nLeading us all to the grave\nLeviathan\nSlaying all foes\nWho dare to oppose\n...\n\n", 
        "Finally at home &#39;with fame and Truh&#39; custom &#39;I could not sleep, nor do I want Ruh&#39; I&#39;m going to the pub on a couple of beers with dancing women, rum d&#39;I&#39;m here ..."
