        "The sun is out\nThe clouds are slowly going\nAnd now my heart is growing fast\nSo let's get up\nPut on you hat and clothing\nLet's take a trip and lose our minds\nLet's go walking through the park today\nI love Sunday Mondays any day\nWhen the skies are blue and it's not grey\n...\n\n", 
        "All I give\nIs all I got\nAnd all I am\nAin't what I'm not\nAnd I ain't gonna lie or beg\nFor your love\nI'm on a natural high\n\nWhen morning comes\nTake my hand\n...\n\n"
