        "This sparkling wine is all but empty.\nToo late for trains and no taxis.\nI know the feeling. seems all too contrived.\nThere was no master plan but the fact is:\nYou must stay with me and learn the secret language of birds.\n\nA tentative dawn about to be breaking\n...\n\n", 
        "Down at the church the flower girl sits. legs innocent, apart.\nI make the picture puzzle fit to start your heart.\nPainted sister stopped beside. a word upon her saintly lip.\nPerhaps admonishing the child inside the open slip.\n\nI don't know where she might go when she runs home at night.\nIt's for the best: I wouldn't rest when I turned out the light.\nNo little flower girl singing in my troubled dream----\nJust an old man's model in a pose from a magazine.\n...\n\n", 
        "Fires on the mountain, and the dogs bark.\nCrash of the ocean swelling: crickets in the dark.\nThe temperature is rising. the village gets no sleep.\nIt's hardly surprising, given the hot company they keep.\n\nSomebody's home in the ash-fall margins;\nSomebody's life in the lost and found.\nBreaking news from the hotel vue pointe.\n...\n\n", 
        "My eyes are white circles above cheekbones on fire:\nPale hand gripping my pen.\nRounding up to the zero, adding infinite fractions,\nLetting nine become ten.\nTwo pink doves strut the shingles\nPicking crumbs from the breakfast I saved\nFor you dear. and I wish you were here\nOn this postcard day.\n\nFocus on the fine indeterminate line\nWhere the sky meets the sea.\n...\n\n", 
        "Crystal fountain springing from the hill.\nIt irrigates your soul. you may drink your fill.\nWater of life, carried high.\nOne hand upon the gallon jar. feel her fix my eye.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hard black crows bobbing where once ran deep furrows.\nFrazzled oak silhouetted in her ivy dress.\nWinter sun catches dog fox through thin hedges:\n...\n\n", 
        "I see you better now, shaded in deeper blue.\nHardly needing to carry the find-your-way lamp\nDown to the river.\nTonight flies a better moon.\n\nSad water buffalo lie fast near the shallows;\n...\n\n", 
        "Dear uncle sold her into the purest kind of slavery.\nHood-eyed little middlemen profited from damaged goods\nAlong the way.\nGood angels brought her back to a last nepal summer.\nDebased, hollow-faced, a smile might become her.\nNow she's cosied up, cosied up and comforted\nIn the warm flush of september.\n...\n\n", 
        "In all my lives, I never knew anyone like you before.\nWoke up one day, swore I heard the sound of heaven knocking on my door.\nAnd after all these years long passing,\nTime to reflect, no time for wasting.\nWalking down the jasmine corridor.\n\nReflecting echoes of quiet laughter.\n...\n\n", 
        "Cool in the corner, tom cat sitting\non the edge of the yard; sand-flies flitting.\nOrange order on a field of green.\nSmothers me to smithereens.\nRum and cola, ice cubes crashing.\nJumping beans and brown eyes flashing.\nLong hair swinging, tell me how d'you feel?\nWell, hot and fancy, it's the habanero reel.\n...\n\n", 
        "It's hard to say I'm sorry.\nMay we just forget about today.\nYou see, I fly by night.\nI fly by night.\n\nI laid my love beside the door\nand left you sleeping on the floor.\nSo long. I fly by night,\nI fly by night.\n...\n\n", 
        "Somewhere in a town in england\nLay a babe with a curious smile.\nHe was of your father's children.\nBorn each side of a dry-stone mile.\n\nHe grew up through the schools and factories,\nBrunel's tunnels and bridges bold.\nGrey towers built high on that kingdom\n...\n\n", 
        "Close in, move out to where you want to go.\nThere's a crowd out there handclapping slow.\nWe're all powered up, switched on, the rig is tight.\nStep into joy. Walk into light.\nNever mind what some people say.\nThey're going to love you anyway.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I am at the end of the day\nWith a cup of cold coffee\nFrom the station buffet.\nOn trains, on trains I seem\nTo spend my life on trains.\n\nSee the blue suit banker in the ticket line.\nGot an evening standard with playboy\nHidden behind.\nOn trains, on trains he seems\nTo spend his life on trains.\n\nTime after time.\nWas I just dreaming?\nDid I help you aboard?\nFull passenger service ---\nLet me help with the door.\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm slipping into grey.\nAnd I was (in my way) good to you.\nAnd you were good for me.\nBye bye my love.\nGoing to play the end game.\n\nIt's growing kind of still.\nYou know there always will be a dream\n...\n\n", 
        "I looked in the mirror then\nSaw my face in a dream.\nWith eyes sharp as diamonds\nBlessed with clear vision.\nThings were not as they seemed.\nBlack and white television\nStared back from the wall.\nIs that my life?\nAm I here at all?\n\nDown in the high road, see\nMotor cavalcades glide\nPast shopwindow dressers\nDesperately covering\nAll the parts they can hide.\nBlack and white television\n...\n\n", 
        "I walk along the strand\nTo catch the late ride home.\nShuttle through the evening gloom\nKnowing I forgot to phone.\nThe back door's open.\nThere's a chill blowing in.\nTake your warm hands off me.\nLet the night begin.\nShush your mouth.\nListen to me.\nI won't say nothing ---\nJust let me be your\nToad in the hole.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "As I drove down the road to look for eden\nSaw two young girls but left them standing there.\nThey were too late to get home on the underground\nAnd probably too drunk, too drunk to care.\n\nCan anyone tell me the way to eden?\nI'll ask them there, have they a job for me.\n...\n\n", 
        "Do we inhabit some micro-space\nAnd interface through wires.\nDance on a printed circuit board\nThrow the software to the fires.\nMy memory's slim --- so volatile\nBut I'm learning.\nPlug yourself in. stay for awhile.\nUn-discerning.\n\nAnd on dusty terminals\nFinger me lightly do.\n...\n\n", 
        "The lights are down in germany\nAnd germany is closed to me\nDifferent somehow this time.\n\nThe airport's stiff, cold corridors\nRing empty beats through hollow feet\nThat I find to be mine.\n\n...\n\n"
