Is that you?)\nDo we stay home all the time, cause you want me all to yourself?\n(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)\nOr am I locked away out of fear that I'll find someone else?\n(Is that you? Is that you?)\n\nWell I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight\nJust because you think I might\nFind somebody worthy\nOh I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight\nMaybe if you treat me right\nYou won't have to worry\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
