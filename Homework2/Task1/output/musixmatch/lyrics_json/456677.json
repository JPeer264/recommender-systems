        "Black stains on broken glass\nOn the last day of November\nImmerse beauty by the trail\nOf the last scene I remember\n\nA cry for help\nA pair of drained eyes\nNowhere to turn\nUnable to rise\n...\n\n", 
        "I fear my own shadow\nIn the city smoke\nLike a wave's undertow\nThe silence awoke\n\nThe city lights are blending\nMy eyes and my soul\nDiffers not day from night\nEntering black hole\n\n...\n\n", 
        "So little or no\nKnowledge of this\nInject into the heart\nFatal first kiss\n\nSo much, all too much\nFeelings of guilt\nStare into your own eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "Touch her skin\nAnd watch it bleed\nTaste the words\nInjurious seed\n\nNaked walls\nCold, piercing light\nLeft to rot\nThis starlit night\n...\n\n", 
        "I wake to bleed another day\nDragging my anvil of pain\nBetrayed, abandoned, rejected by life\nMy torment has branded its stain\n\nAt ease to leave this forsaken earth\nMy soul is awaiting my cry\nDirecting my lifeline away from its path\n...\n\n", 
        "Keep in absence of truth\nMy smile within this hollow\nTrust in me like I trust this noose\nYou will never find out why\n\nFire bleeding from this picture of you\nHide from this unpleasant\nI'd give you the ashes\nOnly I could find one reason to trust in you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Feel the chills down your spine\nLet me break down\nYour last will to deny\n\nPut your life on the line\n...\n\n", 
        "Head out to the unknown\nWith sincere dismay\nFear will direct you\nThrough the safest way\n\nNever ask a question\nDon't reveal a lie\nWhy should you bother?\nWhen you can just pass right by?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sight, what a terrible sight\nSeeing my own demise\nWorms crawl, maggots creeping\nGod, tell me that I am sleeping\n\nI'm holding on in vain\nYou have killed again\nNursery rhymes off tune\nNothing can make it right\n...\n\n", 
        "Something that'll last\nForever, but never. Let it grow\nHurt from the inside\nNo one's on your side\n\nNo one to care for\nEveryone to blame\nNo one to care for\nNot even a name\n...\n\n", 
        "Since the dawn of society, there have reigned a\nnumber of commandments one must obey to attain\nsocial stability and uniformity.\n\nThe commandments are:\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Pale aversion in fatal alliance\nScream for deliverance\nFake your own reverence\n\nDrifting in and out, I won't lie\nInsecure my visions blind my\nSight, my means, my faith, my view\nI hate myself for trusting you!\n...\n\n"
