        "Crimson hands cursed and bound\nSilence broken as the world comes crashing down\nAll that lives expires\nYet so untimely\nLord dethroned\nMy brother betrayer\n\nRipping wounds revealed\nHarbinger of doom\nThe sky has fallen\nAnd I bare it's weight\n\nThese walls harbor uniquity\nA darkness which never sleeps\nSewing the seeds of doubt within\nI am but a pawn\n\n...\n\n", 
        "As the world turns again\nLifetimes come to an end\nDays are lost in a void\nCloser with every turn\n\nI felt the earth move\nYet grounded to my core\nWatched the clouds race past\nAn age transpired before my eyes\n\nAs the day turns to night\nForced into confinement\n...\n\n", 
        "Empyreal (Part 1)\n\nIt's said the future's written in the skies\nThe stars align\nPlanets collide\nShadows inherit the Earth\n\nDenounce this shallow faith\nI have seen through the veil\nI espouse this call to arms\n\nOf the Empyreal paradigm\n...\n\n", 
        "Through compulsion*\nDeceptive thoughts escape\nRevealing a leech within\nAll blood replaced\nArchaic Ancestry\nConsuming the mind\nShape shifting\nHallowed guise\nSoul engraved\nBecoming a corporeal slave\nBeneath the surface\nLies another being\nSeeping through your skin\n...\n\n", 
        "Tunnels of light capture symbols in the stone\nOut of touch and weak\nReturn this scourge to it's seed\n\nHeld in life's quicksand\nEmptiness defined\nBy the blaze ignite\nEmbody the light\n\nInfinite fires burn through mortal skin and bone\nAs shapes shift and coil\nDarkness departs, divides\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I am your keper\nAnd this wall will protect\nWill all great at Neptune's ocean wash the blood from my hands\n\nTransformed and tiresome\nA ghostly vision of what life used to be\n\nDead eyes stare aimlessly\nAt what's beyond\n\nIn need of anguish\nThe penalty repaind\nTo end the means\n\nI am Impurity\n\nImprisoned in a cold shell\nSo isolate\n...\n\n", 
        "A wave of light\nTears through the eye\nAs the taste of bitter destruction\nSwells the tongue\n\nBaron Earth\nSwen with seeds of wrath\nEngulfed in tragedy\nBy purveyors of corruption and greed\n\nOn suffering they feed\n\nFlock to the heavens\nIn swells of despair\n...\n\n", 
        "How quick the seasons change\nThe leaves turned from green to grey\nA flickering Apparition hovers above\n\nSo familiar\nYet so distant\nPreserved in age\nIcey hands support a somber face\n\nLike a curse of immortality\nFather time mocks me\n\nThrough grave and tomb\nPast valley and precipice\nEmerges the ghost of retribution\n\nThe horizon burns\nSet light by kin and blood\n...\n\n", 
        "You chose the light\nI took the dark\nAnd in your pain I suffered\nThe day is done\nBut what is left\nOur tome is out and they are counting\nThey still regret their every moves\n\nEmpty souls\nEndless Woes\nEvery thought will drag you...\n...\n\n", 
        "Venom lingers upon your tongue\nSpreading deception like air into our lungs\nYou're bound by the fire that burns us all to dust\nIf light is our salvation there's nothing left to trust\n\nCasting the shadows\n\nPoisoned ethics disguised by a smile\nDrop the blindfold in front of your eyes\nRun from the lighting, your fists will tell no tales\n...\n\n", 
        "Memory is the sadness we keep\nEternity is an endless sleep\nIn the light of remorse\nWe'll let the pain run its course\n\nThis will be our desire\nBurns right though your soul\n...\n\n", 
        "Shamed by the weak and cast down in disgust\nA shell of a broken man without trust\nPreaching upon open ears of the deaf\nDepraved words uttered beneath your cold breath\nKilling what's left of the embers of youth\nScraping and clawing for a whisper of truth\nSewing our mouths shut as nothing escapes\nLove and grave is a display of a man you once were\n...\n\n",
