        "Wake up, can you hear me?\nYou're so clever, did you find me?\nIn the backroom, in your closet\nIn your suitcase, there's no running\n\nI will find you, like the glacier\nCan't you see me, leaving Canyons\nIn your cheekbones, passing through you\nIn the shadows, scenes undo you\n\nCut your ribbon, as it follows you\nEverything, everything\nHow can you sleep at night?\nAnd it falls apart\nAnything, anything\nHow can you sleep at night?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I should've been cautious,\nI should've been honest,\nBut now I have to wait.\nYou missed the merge,\nPassing the dark,\nAnd this body is useless again,\nAnd again.\nWhen the sun gets halfway around the globe,\nI know... I know...\nBut you never thought what today brought in.\n\nThis time with feelings gone,\nMistakes were made one hundered times,\nEach a brave eye.\nThis time with feelings gone,\nMistakes were made one hundered times,\nEach a brave eye.\n\nYou spoke with resonate, beet red,\n...\n\n", 
        "Crumbling around the freefall\nThis missing air will forever make\nYour nerves crawl\nCrumbling\nWe will assume the worst\n\nEncapsulation, fists clenched and falling\nMistakes make it easy\n\nHarmonic turbulence shakes\nTies red booths to magazines\n...\n\n", 
        "Apathy falls in the ocean\nAt least we went down fighting\nAt the bottom of the ocean\nThe scenery can fail calm\nUp till now, been riding fine, yeah\nBut the curving walls leave me behind, yeah\n\nDo you remember the days?\nDid you forget those days?\nWhat would the odds maker say?\nWould the odds maker say\n\nWe're drinking on jet streams\n...\n\n", 
        "The host of the show came down\nCollapsed to the ground\nAnd the crime scene revisits me\nThis body shut down in Bordeaux\nAnd they go for good hope\nOn the balcony I sit and sleep\nThe future has fallen short\nWhen the sun sets North\nAnd the clouds fall from mirrored walls\n\nWords speak and choose\nMake sense and lose\n...\n\n", 
        "From the top of buildings you'll shout\nTo the kids in the street below\nAnd you'll know\nShe swings with the ease of a hammer\nFrom the edge down to the ground\nAnd you'll know\n...\n\n", 
        "Looking back with perfect symmetry\nMistakes were you, mistakes were me\nPhotos fall through the glass\nPaint it black to hide your face\nStatic screams deaf the masses\nBut what do they have to say?\n\nFan the flames to the landslide\nCrown yourself in the wake\nWe play this disaster\nFanfare, fanfare, liar\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Arms open but I've just broken in\nThrough a crack in a long division\nCan I make a decision without confusion?\nSeemed something but became nothing at all\nWhat happened to the old and stable?\nWhen the powers that be, fail and heads will roll\n\nSomeday low notes fade away\nAnd go, true and stale, true and stale\nSomewhere words don't crater in at all\n\nCurrents shiftin' and green lights on my right\nThese miles hold an infinite time\nLong enough to remember and regret precursors\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll qualify this circumstance\nBroadcast, renew this chance\nPin hope on this promise\n\nGraduate to a settled score\nProjects through mansion doors\nStand up, dust yourself off\n\nIt's troubled now by swelling tide\nBleached hope and sandstone lies\nYou're dazed in the moment\n\nThis time I'll get it right\nYou can't defend it\nIt's predetermined\n\nThis time, this time I'll get it right\nYou can't defend it\nIt's predetermined\n...\n\n", 
        "Locked up in the distance\nIn the falter above us\nAs the contrails pass, you spoke your mind\nOld photos distort you\nAnd you're frowning a smile\nAs the misery makes you act blind\n\nStand down, fall apart and the trouble starts\nYeah, the trouble starts over again\nStand down, fall apart and the trouble starts\nYeah, the trouble starts over again\n\nIn the scenes of this casting\nWhere a tragedy follows\nAs the contrails pass this vacant sky\n\nStand down, fall apart and the trouble starts\n...\n\n",
