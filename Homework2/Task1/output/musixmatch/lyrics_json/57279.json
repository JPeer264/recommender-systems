        "The sky blacks out.\nBlacks out, blacks out.\n\nI wake up in the sand again,\nFace down, choking on my life.\nI begin to put back all the pieces of last night,\nBut then I realize I don't know where I have been.\n\nIs this a place, is this a time?\nIs this a place, is this a time?\nOr has this lost boy finally lost his mind?\nIs this a place, is this a time?\nIs this a place, is this a time?\nOr am I chasing a dream that was never mine?\n\nNevermind.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've seen the future\nAnd the future is smoke\nA shroud of ghost encompass\nA cloud of doubt on which you choke\n\nMy mind's so clouded in\nIn this life of distress\nDon't sink with me\nDon't sink with me\nI'm an awful wreck\n\nJust pull me out\nTake me away from all this\nThis is the last chance I have\nTo not end up dead\n\nSo just give me the chance\nTo find another moment\nWhere passion stemmed out\nFrom the start\n...\n\n", 
        "I've carried this out for way to long\nI'm sick of singing these tragic songs\n\nIt's been days since I could open up my eyes\nOpen up my eyes\nEvery waking moment's another passing by\nPassing by\n\nI'm left stranded on my own again\nEmpty handed, in need of amends\nBroken, battered, abused my friend\nOr could you not recall that name?\n\nPretend that you ever shared a world with me\nI feel like living the dying dream\nThe one where you wake up with me\nPull the covers up with no light to see\n\nIs this all I have to say\nAbout anything anymore?\nI'm just trying to keep myself on my feet\nKeep living in the consciousness of this\n\n...\n\n", 
        "As her insides screaming, let me out\nShe speaks as if someone's in the room with her\n(Someone sits quietly on the ceiling tile)\nStill facing the corner with eyes gouged out\nThese tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now\n\nHer heart beats on\nShe's just not, giving up yet\nThough blinded by the devil's touch\nShe rises above him\n\nShe rises above\nShe races towards the light\nHer heart beats on\n\nShe stares death straight in the face\nHer heart beats on\n...\n\n", 
        "This is an open ended sky, with open eyes too tired to look away\nSay you'll stay forever by my side, and forever we'll be standing here\n\nThe dead still (walk the streets)\nThis means war ((on) everyone)\nYou can't hear (them lying to us)\nYou cant see (their fingers crossed)\n(x2)\n\nLets keep our thoughts on guard this time\nWe'll keep on moving on\nJust don't let them get too close\n(x2)\n...\n\n",

        "We lied as we rode down (down our paths)\nWe tied all these loose ends (back together)\n\nWe looked to the sky for signs\nFor a way to relieve the masses\nWe kneeled in candle lit rooms\nTonight we dance, don't hold back\n\nNo, no we don't hold back\n\nThis is a toast to the ones we've lost\n...\n\n",
