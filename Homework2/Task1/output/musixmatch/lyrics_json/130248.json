        "A fire burns, water comes\nYou cool me down\nWhen I'm cold inside\nYou are warm and bright\nYou know you are so good for me, yeah\n\nWith your child's eyes\nYou are more than you seem\nYou see into space, I see in your face\nThe places you've been\nThe things you have learned\nThey sit with you so beautifully, yeah\n\nAnd you know there's no need to hide away\n...\n\n",
