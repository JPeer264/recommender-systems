        "Original: Anthony Callea\n\nI remember when we met\nBefore I was invisible\nI thought I played hard to get\nPretend I'm unapproachable\n\nBut somebody else came along\nAnd took all the chances that I missed\nStuck on the sideline I keep thinking\nThere she goes\n\nRefrain:\nFalling like rain\nNo I don't get to hold her tonight\nFalling like rain\nI was pushed to the back of the line\n'Cos even though I need her love\nAnd crave her touch\nI guess I wasn't fast enough\nFalling like rain\nJust not for me, not for me no no\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 'til the cops come knocking\nOh oh, oh oh, oh oh 'til the cops come knocking\n\nTonight I'm telling the boys\nYou are bringing your girls\nMeet us up around 12 o'clock\nWearing something hot\nMe and you sneak off to the VIP room\nSpend our night dancing to some classic soul tune\n\nWe ain't stopping\nKeep on rocking\nUntil the cops come knock, knock, knocking\nUntil 5-0\nSmash in the door\nWe are staying on the dance floor\n\nThe DJ's gonna keep on spinning the cuts\nUntil the cops come knocking\nThe bar will stay open\nServing you shots until the cops come knocking\nThe floor will be packed as long as the beat drops\nUntil the cops come knocking\nThe neighbours gonna call them but we wont stop\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh oh Ooh oh right\nNow I'm pimped out suits on I swear to god\nI'm gettin' it on\nChampange charge the card\nTippin' the bottle till it's gone\n\nIt's you girl\nI'm wanting to know\nYou feeling me we're good to go\nTell your friends to get with me\nAll I want is just tonight\n\nThe feelings so right got me blown away\nBody's so good can't take it's about time that we get it on baby\nYou got what I like I'll do what it takes\nSo if that's what you want then w do it your way\n\nYou gotta get up off your seat now baby\nWe ain't got the rest of our lives\nCause if that's how you want it\nThen tahat's how we do it\nYou know the music got you movin' baby\nWe got all night\nSo if that's how you want it\nThen that's how we do it\n\nOh oh Ooh oh right\nSo now we turn the page\n...\n\n", 
        "Now I'm here\nAnd I never doubted someday I would be\nI said I'll be there\nAnd I don't care if there's no road\nI'll find my way\nIt doesn't matter what it takes\nSo go ahead and say what you like\nThere ain't no way I'm missing this ride\n\nI feel so high I could fly\nWas born to reach for the sky\nOh no, I can not deny this feeling\nAnd I just hope you can see\nThat there is no holding back in me\n...\n\n", 
        "Girl you told me\nThat you don't think that I'm the one for you\nAnd you showed me\nIt doesn't really matter what I do\nBut each and every step I take leads me back to you\nAnd I fear when I'm awake my dreams will not come true\nI don't know what else to do when I'm close to you\nThan to hold my breathe and cross my fingers\nNo matter what you're saying\nI'd still be praying and keep on coming back for more\nCause all I do is dream about you\n...\n\n", 
        "For all the love that we share\nFor every moment\nEvery time you're there\nYou make it easy\nEvery step of the way\nFor all the love that we share\n\nFor all the joy that you bring\nFor all the good times\nAll the special things\nYou make it easy\nLike a natural thing\nFor all the joy that you bring\n\nAnd if I'm lost\nIf I fall behind\nI trust on you to make me come alive\n\nYou show me everything I am\nNo doubt about it\nNow my heart is in your hands\n...\n\n", 
        "The same old love song is playing tonight on every station\nBut you're not around\nI should have told you the way I feel\nHow you complete me\nWhenever you are near\n\nI wish that I had only seen the signs\nI didn't know my life would change that night\n\nWe were invincible\nWe were one of a kind\nNow the dream is all that I have\nBut I remember when we were invincible\n\nMy friends keep saying,\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been looking for something all my life\nAlways short of one thing to make it right\nAll the time I kept a foot outside the door\nAlways haunted by a drive for so much more\nNever satisfied enough to let it go\n\nBut now that I have found you\n\nThe feeling I get when I'm around you\nI've no place left to go\nAnd I didn't see until I found you\nThat love could make me grow\nNow I know\nWherever you want to is where I'll call my home\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish I could believe\nThere's somebody else\nSomebody else out there for me\nThey say I'm naive\nAnd I got more then one chance\nBut who are they to change how I feel?\n\nI know they call you names\n'Cause you're out there playing games with every guy\nAnd it makes me cry\nDon't you know it?\nBut I will wait for you 'til the trying times are through\nAnd I'll forgive\nIf you'll be mine\n\nI could be him\nI could be him\nI could be that guy you need\nI could be him\nI could be him\nYou don't have to run no more\nI could be him\nI could be him\nYou're the only one for me\nI could be him\nI could be him\nAll right now\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm out of love\nMy heart is closed\nIt stays alive\nBy chasing a ghost\n\nAll of the times\nI held you close to me\nWhat if I'd known\nHow short it would be\nAll the love that you left behind\nKeeps on livin'\nInside my mind\n\nBaby, I guess it's time to let you go\nThough deep inside this feeling grows\nThat so much was left unsaid\nLeft undone but now instead\n(The) Time has come to let you go\n\nAnother year\n...\n\n",

        "Whoa!\n\nOoohh\n\nYou really got me now\nYou get me out of my mind\nI dream a little louder\nI gotta know tonight\nI'm gonna give all I got, while it's time\nAnd you make me wanna shout it out\nI gotta ask you right now\n\nDo you feel like I feel, Natalie Natalie?\nDo you feel like I feel, Natalie Natalie?\nNatalie?\n...\n\n", 
        "Am I coming through\nCan't you hear me\nCrying out your name\nAnd don't you leave me here\nAll alone\nAgainst a hurricane\n\nI'm trying every frequency\nBut so far there's no answer\nJust knowing there's a chance for us\nCould save me from disaster\n\nI'm sending you an S.O.S.\nI'm sending you an S.O.S.\nI'm drowning and nobody else\nBut you can rescue me\nI'm sending you an S.O.S.\nI'm sending you an S.O.S.\n...\n\n"
