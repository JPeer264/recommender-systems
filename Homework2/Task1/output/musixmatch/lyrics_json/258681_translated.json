        "Get out of town,\nBefore it's too late, my love\nGet out of town,\nBe good to me please\n\nWhy wish me harm?\nWhy not retire to a farm?\n...\n\n", 
        "Someday, my prince will come\nSomeday, we'll meet again\nAnd away to his castle, we'll go\nTo be happy forever, I know\n...\n\n", 
        "Packup all my cares and woe\nHere I go, feeling low\nBye bye, blackbird\n\nWhere somebody waits for me\nSugar is sweet, so is he\n...\n\n", 
        "How was I to know that this was always\nOnly just a little game to you?\nAll the time I felt you gave your heart\nI thought that I would do the same for you\n\nTell the truth, I think I should have\nSeen it coming from a mile away\nWhen the words you say are\nBaby, I'm a fool who thinks\nIt's cool to fall in love\n\nIf I gave a thought to fascination\n...\n\n", 
        "If the stars were mine\nI'd give them all to you\nI'd pluck them down right from the sky\nand leave it only blue\nI would never let the sun forget to shine upon your face\nso when others would have rain clouds you'd have only sunny days\nIf the stars were mine\nI'd tell you what I'd do\nI'd put the stars right in a jar and give them all to you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My soul is a weary\nMy soul is a weary\nMy soul is a weary\nI said my soul is a weary\nMy soul is a weary and beaten down from all of my misery\nOh Lord who will comfort me\nMy soul is a weary and beaten down from all of my misery\nOh Lord who will comfort me\n...\n\n", 
        "Your eyes maybe whole\nBut the story I'm told\nIs your heart is as black as night\n\nYour lips maybe sweet\nSuch that I can't compete\nBut your heart is as black as night\n\nI don't know why it came along\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't need anything more than I got\nI'll make it simple when others may not\n\nWhenever you need some company\nSome love of a different kind\nCome to your lover, undercover\nAnd let me ease your mind\n\nWhenever your heart beats heavy\n...\n\n", 
        "Deep within your heart, you know it's plain to see\nLike Adam was to Eve, you were made for me\nThey say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wine\nOur love is easy\n\nIf you ask me plainly I would glady say\nI'd like to have you round just for them rainy days\nI like the touch of your hand, the way you make no demands\nOur love is easy\n\nOur love is easy\nLike water rushing over stone\nOh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known\n...\n\n", 
        "The stars stars stars stars Tell me, why I look at you? The stars the stars the stars Tell me star that you look? The stars the stars If I only knew ...", 
        "The rain, the rain\nRain came down in sheets that night\nAnd you and I stared out to the left and to the right\nRain came down and cursed, seemed to laugh at us\nStill daylight\n...\n\n", 
        "Birds may cease to spread their wings\nBut it don't matter\nBut it don't matter\nWhen does May envelop spring\nBut it don't matter\nBut it don't matter, cuz\nWhen I'm with you\nMy whole world stands still\nYou're my one and only thrill\n\nShips may never leave the dock,\nBut it don't matter\n...\n\n", 
        "Deep within the corners of my mind\nI keep a memory of your faces\nAnd I only pull it out when I long for your embrace\n\nDeep within the corners of my mind\nI'm haunted by your smile\nAs it promises me joys like a journey to a tropic isle\n...\n\n",
