        "A birth that came from more than sound\nNow rages on from town to town\nA giant grows more every day\nAnd now the maniac is here to stay\n\nA feeling you can't kill\nIt's the power, it's a will\nControls your thoughts but you can't see\n\nJust when you thought it safe he suddenly appears\nHe feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears\nHe gives the message and your mind is filled with blue\nAnd now the maniac lives inside of you\n\n(CHORUS)\nHe's back. The suicidal maniac\n\nEach day he grows more and more\nHe's bigger now than ever before\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
