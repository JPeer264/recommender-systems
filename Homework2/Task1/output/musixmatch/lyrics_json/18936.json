        "Hello\u2026 come into my world\u2026\nI've been sitting here on my own,\nfor quite a while now\ncontemplating things, things that happened,\nyesterday, and the day before,\nand the day before.\n\nHello\u2026 come into my world\u2026\nYou're welcome here, it's an open door,\nbut you're the only one,\n...\n\n", 
        "Into the night\nWith no fear of the dark\nThis soul made of light\nIs safe in my heart\nThis child I hold dear\nIt sleeps in my bones\n...\n\n", 
        "In the rain\nI stand\nWithout you\nIn the rain\nIf you were here\nI would touch your hand\n...\n\n", 
        "See the shadows, how they move across the room\nand up above, always one step ahead of you\u2026\nbut see the light\nDo you see any light? Or do you just see spite?\nIn the distance, if I look I see the sun\nObliterating all the shadows, everyone\nbut it's a long climb,\nthrough a sea of lies\u2026 into a stream of light.\n\nThere is a sun for me\nIt's from within\nFor all to see\nHow does it feel to be lost in life?\nIf I try\n...\n\n", 
        "It's five thirty a.m.\nLaying here thinking again\nThe sun is so beatiful\nSmiling pink in the sky\nI'm wondering why\nThis doesn't happen all the time\nBut then maybe if it did\nIt wouldn't be so blinding\n...\n\n", 
        "To write down words is not enough,\nstill I can try to put across\nthe width and the depth of this ordinary thing,\nit's called a name and that is love.\nThough it's hard to believe it's an ordinary thing,\nit's what our lives are made up of\nand therefore it must be.\n\nYou are the mountain\u2026 and the stream\n...\n\n", 
        "See this evil in my eye\nI refuse to deny it\nIt must be something you don't like\nBut I refuse to deny it.\n\nIt's only ever counterproductive\nwhen you're nice a pie all of the time,\nthen you end up killing someone dead\nbecome sugar sweet as ice cream\n...\n\n", 
        "We were in a bar you and I,\nthe room was dull and brown just like the sky.\nThe clock went tick tock with its hands on my hands,\nconversation was a farce,\nwe were off in cuckoo land.\n\nEverybody knows\nwhen you're wasting your time\nit's your own\nDoes it matter though\nit always has been that way\nAny wind that blows\n...\n\n", 
        "Warm\nat home\non this big old smelly sofa\nthat makes me feel like I'm five again\nIt's\nthe end\nof the day\nthe hearth is ablaze\nand I'm resting my weary brain\n\nIt's funny\n...\n\n", 
        "You came down to see me\nin your long white dress that angels wear.\nI could see you and I could feel you,\nI know you were there.\nAnd I was driving a big car on my own in the dark,\nand we were together, but it didn't last.\nBut you were real in the dream,\nI know you were there to tell me you were alright,\nyou were real in the dream,\n...\n\n", 
        "All that I have is all that you've given me\nDid you never worry that I'd come to depend on you\nI gave you all the love I had in me\nNow I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true\n\nWrapped in her arms I see you across the street\nAnd I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on\nYou talk of love but you don't know how it feels\nWhen you realise that you're not the only one\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Listen everybody\nespecially you boys\nit is right to be left alone\nwhen the one you love is never home\n\nI love too hard\nmy friends sometimes say\nbut I believe I believe\nthat a man should be loved that way\nbut it hurts me so inside\nto see him treat me so unkind\n\nSomebody somewhere\ntell him it's unfair\n...\n\n", 
        "If you need a reason to remain\nthink of me\nhow I tried to tell you\nyou were blind you would not see\nyou know it doesn't matter\nif you're near or far away\nanything I can do\nI will do to make you stay\n...\n\n"
