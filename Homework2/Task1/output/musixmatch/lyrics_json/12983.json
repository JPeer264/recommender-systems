        "Shooting star in the night sky, burning fire and light\nYou can reach me tomorrow, you can hold me tonight\n\nWon't you let yourself go, release your heart and your soul\nForget your grief and your woe and take a trip to the stars, let's go\n\nThrough the pillars of time you can fly to me\nThrough the realms of illusion and beyond destiny\nWon't you hold me tonight, you know the feeling is right\nWe could be as high as a kite, let's take a trip to the stars, let's go\n\nTime to reach for the sky, it's time to say goodbye\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
