        "This Is My City\nTurning my memories\nHoping to find out\nWhere all the loyalty's gone\nThe friends that I had then\nTurned into strangers\nThinking of you all along\n\nIf you see me now\nYou won't see me alone\nI'll be heading home\n\n'Cause this is my town\n...\n\n", 
        "From the cradle to the grave\nThe Oi Boy trying to be brave\nShow he's going to everyone\nFrom his birth to his death\nGot to prove that he's the best\nDon't even mean it's got to me done\n\nBut he's yesterday's hero\n...\n\n", 
        "I come from south London I think I'm cool\nI wear a cheap crombie and that's about all\nI go down the pub with all the lads\nTheir wearing their chains that they got from their dads\nBut all I got was a rotten cheap chain\nMy wife's got in debt with the club book again\n\nI'm a plastic gangster\nThey call me a crown and anchor\n...\n\n", 
        "Jealousy, Jealousy, look what it's done to me\nJealousy, Jealousy, I'm not like I used to be\n\nI don't know what's happening to me\nI'm not who I used to be\nI only know I'm the best\nA cut above all the rest\n\nJealousy, Jealousy, look what it's done to me\nJealousy, Jealousy, I'm not like I used to be\n\nFriends all say my name with hate\n...\n\n",

        "He'll do just about anything to get that bit of glory\nHe'll go out with his lads to make that headline story\nThe normal man in the clubhave no nees to worry\nHe'll make his name oh so quick make it in a hurry\n\nJack Jack Jack the lad they say he's mean\nthey say he's bad, Jack Jack Jack the lad\n...\n\n", 
        "Just left school cant find no work\nBe a building labourer or an office clerk\nCant believe the men youve seen\nOn the scrapheap and youre only 17\n\nWhat a wonderful world\nWhat a wonderful world this is\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I won't say sorry for what i've done\nI won't say sorry for having fun\nI won't take the blame\nNo i ain't gonna be ashamed\nWon't say sorry for what i've done\nI don't say sorry to anyone\n\n[Chorus]\nShout it out\nShout it out\nI don't give a damn cos im proud of what i am\n...\n\n"
