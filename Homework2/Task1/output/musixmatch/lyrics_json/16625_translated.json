        "Talking and talking in circles and nothing is said\nLouder and prouder you're crushed\nIn the weight of your head\n\nOn top of your pedestal\nNothing is logical yeah\nIt's so confusing, amusing me out of my mind\n\nit's all just invisible noise\nGoing nowhere that I can follow\nIf only you'd get to the point\n...\n\n",

        "Give me a sign\nHave I committed such a crime?\nI don't wanna live\nIn a world that won't forgive\n\nGive me a sign\nSomething real, not sublime\nThe further I run\nThe harder I become\n\nGive me a sign\nDon't make it so hard to find\nGot a long way to go\nJust to know what I'll know\n\nGive me a sign\nTurn this water into wine\nGonna drink till I'm blind\nMake love all the time\n...\n\n", 
        "This is my life, all that I know, it's who I am\nI'm never letting it go (yeah)\nThis is my truth, this is my way\nthere's no better drug, I need it every day\n\nHey, hey, hey, yeah, like a virus\nrunning through my veins\nHey, hey, hey, yeah, it's never gonna change, baby\nthis is my religion\n\nI'm sinned, I'm burned, tarnished and stained\nNot an angel, but I feel no regret or shame (yeah)\nI bleed my words, I drain my voice,\nbut when you love me I don't have any choice\n...\n\n", 
        "All you crave are sleeping days\nNumb uninterrupted\nBlindness is your favorite game\nYou're hated\n\nParanoid and insecure\nCrackin' in your shell\nAntisocial, unattached\nYou're wasted\n\nDisenchanted one, used to breathe in the sun\nNow the black cloud follows you\n\nSay goodbye to the light and watch it fade\n...\n\n", 
        "You know who I really am, don't you girl\nEven I don't understand me\nYou've seen darker days than I've ever known\nStill you shine brighter than anyone\n\nStay in this dream forever\nHoping that tomorrow never comes\nTo take this life away from me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You think you\u00b4ve got it made\nWith all the money you saved\nFor that one rainy day\nYou\u00b4ve got a brand new car\nYou\u00b4re feeling just like a star\nAnd well maybe you are\n\nIf I had a satellite\nI would tell the world tonight\nAnd shout through the sky\n...\n\n", 
        "Now I know more than I ever have\nAnd still I'm just a fool\nAnd I feel something I'm trying not to become\nI already am\n\nNow that the morning light has come\nMaybe the sun will make my vision strong\nAnd it I still can't find my way\nYou'll be there, you'll be there\n\nCan it be I'm just a victim of myself\nReflecting the blame\nAll I know, you just gotta try to rock this world\n...\n\n", 
        "I can see you caving in on yourself\nGoing down in to the past\nDark as hell behind the walls where you hide\nA little hell that makes you broken inside\n\nHide if you want to\nCry if it hurts you\nBut don't worry baby\nEverybody's got a secret\n\nGhosts in the closet\nRust in the faucet\nWe're all dirty baby\nEverybody's got a secret\n\nDemons grow into the lies that feed us\n...\n\n", 
        "Say your prayers tonight\nChase your dreams in flight\n...\n\n", 
        "Dark eyes come down on you\nWhisper your name so sweet\nCold lies break from her lips\nYou don't feel the heat\nThere ain't no time to settle down\nYou're living on shakey ground\nIf that's what love is all about\nThere's only one way out\n\nSomewhere on a distant street\nYou're caught between the tigers\nIf you're walkin' on fire don't burn your feet\nYou're caught between the tigers\n...\n\n", 
        "Wanted love to find me\nEasy love no chains to bind me\nLife on the run, so cold\nThe look in your eyes gets brighter\nSummer night a cool inviter\nClose to the edge, I feel like letting go\nTonight I'm falling for you\nTonight my love is for you\nI'll be the light that guides you\nTonight my love is all for you\n\nSee the warm reflection\n...\n\n", 
        "I've seen the madness of love in flames\nI've seen your eyes reflect the silent pain\nNow like a candle in this empty room\nI burn alone\n\nYou've seen the lonely days never end\nYou've seen break the trust that you depend on\nDon't close your heart too fast\nCause feelings will blind you\nMy love will find you...\n\nEnd of the line, Reach out in time\nMaybe love will come again, my friend\nOpen your eyesLove never dies\n...\n\n", 
        "One fire\nA silent storm in every spirit\nLocked behind a lonely dream still aware\nWhen soldiers of fortune take your mind\nThe heart is your kingdom\nLike magic when you find\n\nIntuition\nOne decision\nHold your heartbeat in your hand\nIntuition, one decision\nLet your dream command\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Run run runnin' we're the victims of the\nNight\nJust like a moving target in a street fight\nBreak down these barricades let the gates\nBegin to fall\nGotta stop take a look live every moment\nOr lose it all\nForever\nShine on, shine on\nNo border will come between us\nForever\nWe are strong together\n\nOn wings of freedom let the change\nBegin to inspire\nWe are the new survivours in the crossfire\n...\n\n", 
        "Why do they try so hard, is it easier that\nWay?\nWhy should they be so cold, are their\nLonely hearts too tough to play?\nIf they could see through the eyes of a\nChild\nThrough the mystery of time\nVisions cry in the hearts of the wild\n\nAre we too young to know\nNo we understand it\nWe've got to let it show\nAnd maybe we can learn to love\n\nIt's like they were never there even\nThough they talk about it\nRemember the beauty within\nBut now it seems they can live without it\n...\n\n", 
        "\"I'm just another ordinary lover\nBut it's alarming how charming I feel\nIt's hard to express, well my love\n...\n\n", 
        "Through timeless change in my dreams\nI am closer from ageless memories, long ago\nTo enlightened frontiers I'll take you there\nOh, mystic child, together where ever we fly\n\nSomehow I feel like I'm going through changes\nAnd sometimes I wake up still dreaming\nOnly a lifetime can fill the pages\nA story of wisdom for all\n...\n\n"
