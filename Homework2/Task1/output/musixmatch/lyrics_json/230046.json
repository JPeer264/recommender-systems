        "The birds they make faces at me\nIt's all a big conspiracy\nThey start to sing when I try to sleep\nIt drives me mad,\nThey're calling\nUnder my rock,\nIt never stops.\n\nI love them though, they're all I've got\n...\n\n", 
        "Tense, is what I felt inside of my head on Monday\nI had to prove my research\nWho's coming...\nY'know it doesn't make any sense how I keep\nLosing all my t-shirts\n\nThe sun shines in other skies\nThe moon rise, I'm hypnotised\nWho's coming through the window?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Move over and over, over again\nEight thirty I'm early, early again\nI get up,\nBut I can't stand to raise my head,\nSo move over and over again\nMove over and over again\nMove over and over, over again\n\nThis feeling when I'm sober, sober again\nI get up, but the pain rushes to my head\n...\n\n", 
        "Your head might be clear\nBut today my melody will stay\n\nClose to the shore where we drive\nI honour you with song\n\nMy song, I wrote it in days\nBut it's gonna stay forever, and ever\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a girl I used to see\nBut I doubt that she saw me\n'Cos she couldn't see or talk\nOr hear or have a thought\nAnd I saw her in a dream\nAnd we had a cup of tea\nShe said Liam would you help me\nI want to see the world\nWhen you're asleep, then we will meet\nTogether we will learn\n\nAnd all my world rained down on her\nWell she was born with diversions in her head\nAll my world rained down on her\nWell she was born with diversions in her head\n...\n\n", 
        "I heard you speak to me\nThe words I can't repeat\nThe seat beside the tree\nI hope you're there tonight\n\nAiming for your head, get down\nYou're the only one around\n...\n\n", 
        "Gone today, to the coast of San Jose\nWith the money that I made\nSold the rights to my play\n\nRun to the beach\nWhere the salty air is sweet\nDance on the shore\n'Cos the ocean is the cure\n\n...\n\n", 
        "First light I walk into the kitchen\nDishes from the dinner last night\n\nThe silence grips me by the window\nWaiting for the time to come\nI wanted to hear the sound\n\nBy now I'm sure you get the picture\nSeems like there's some meaning inside\n\nFour hours standing in the same room\nWaiting for the time to pass\nI wanted to hear the sound of the motorway\n\nShe's gonna make it home for the weekend\n...\n\n", 
        "Well the reason that I\nhave to spend the entire\nrest of my life making the most of my time\nbeing free from the man\nplease you all if I can\nfind it happens a lot\nbreaking things when I'm not right\nMove to the hill\nfrom a chemical spill\nhave a roof made of glass\nand a house full of class\nbe a mystery guy\nwear a shirt and a tie\n...\n\n", 
        "Tense, is what I felt inside of my head on Monday\nI had to prove my research\nWho's coming...\nY'know it doesn't make any sense how I keep\nLosing all my t-shirts\n\nThe sun shines in other skies\nThe moon rise, I'm hypnotised\nWho's coming through the window?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In Darkwell lane\nThere's bats in the sky tonight\nThey breathe the same\nAnd we come to life at night\nOur eyes become bright\n\nFly all the night\nSleep when it's light\nFly all the night\n...\n\n", 
        "You've got a fire in your belly\nAnd swollen eyes staring back at me\nStill got my car parked in the alley\nIn the garage\nYou look much older when you're mad\nYour heart starts beating like a discotheque\nGot no regrets, except I wish you were here with me\nAnd on my own, I try so hard just to be content\nGot no regrets, except I wish you were here with me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Better to be\nBigger than the other\nHeart on your sleeve\nAnd hat on your head\nI want to see you\nPlaying with your shadow\nHypnotise me\nWith every step\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nFalling asleep\nOr sitting\nAt the doctor\nI don't believe\nA thing that he says\nOrdinary people\nLike I told you\nAre following me\nEverywhere\n\nBottle it up (4x)\n\nGirl\n...\n\n", 
        "Your photo all over the altar\nYour friends dressed in black\nIt's the first time I've seen you in ages\nHold on, my old time bomb\n\nEveryone gather to the chapel, to the chapel\nEveryone gather to the chapel, to the chapel\nEveryone loved you, yes everyone\nEveryone gather to the chapel, to the chapel\n...\n\n", 
        "Try and get some rest\nTry and get some sleep\nAll these roads will take you to me\n\nTry to slow your heart\nTry and clear your head\nNight is just the day giving in\n\n...\n\n", 
        "In the Autumn wind\nI remember him\nWith a common name\nBut he's the only one\nIn this town\nWho acts his age\nWhen we're all giving in\nOnce was fun\nWill later on be boring\nBy the fire light\nWhen it's late at night\nI can hear him hum\nSings the songs\nOf a merry actor\n...\n\n", 
        "Been a long time since i've seen your face\nI've been down, i've been in lonely places\nNow you say you're feeling different\nNow you say you're feeling different\nBeen a long time since i heard your voice\nTelling me lies i always believe in\nNow you're saying something different\nNow you're saying something different\n\nMaybe you've seen it all before\nBut i'm gonna tell you something more\nThere's no such thing as a second chance\nThere's no such thing as another try\nThere's no such thing as starting all over\n...\n\n", 
        "It's a sad day when it comes to this\nBut a free man is a happier man\nWalk home and reminisce\nYou were the highlight of the party\n\nMy head feels like a lead balloon\nI've got little to no memory\nI blame myself and so do you\nIn the wee hours of the morning\n\nStuck in traffic, lost in memories\n...\n\n", 
        "Been a long time since i've seen your face\nI've been down, i've been in lonely places\nNow you say you're feeling different\nNow you say you're feeling different\nBeen a long time since i heard your voice\nTelling me lies i always believe in\nNow you're saying something different\nNow you're saying something different\n\nMaybe you've seen it all before\nBut i'm gonna tell you something more\nThere's no such thing as a second chance\nThere's no such thing as another try\nThere's no such thing as starting all over\n...\n\n"
