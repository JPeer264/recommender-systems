        "I've grown accustom to losing sleep.\nSweep me off my feet, dig your nails into my wounds and pull.\nA lucid dream, where my chest will collapse from the weight of a fictitious ghost. Tear through me, sacrifice me to your sea.\nWith broken arms I'm left to carry my shell with no help from the current. Lifeless, I am dragging me down.\n...\n\n", 
        "Back-pedalling into the black, but I can still make out the figures that will threaten my well being.\nThe wind will rise and fall, but never sway from side to side.\nProgression halted, encapsulating the fluid weave of death like a garden that contains all of it's arrested offspring.\nWe're afraid to force our legs to break free from the earth and take the first step towards our insecurity.\nSleep away your selfishness.\n...\n\n"
