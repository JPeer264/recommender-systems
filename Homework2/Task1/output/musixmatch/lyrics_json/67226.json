        "When the days are cold\nAnd the cards all fold\nAnd the saints we see\nAre all made of gold\n\nWhen your dreams all fail\nAnd the ones we hail\nAre the worst of all\nAnd the blood's run stale\n\nI wanna hide the truth\nI wanna shelter you\nBut with the beast inside\nThere's nowhere we can hide\n\nNo matter what we breed\nWe still are made of greed\nThis is my kingdom come\nThis is my kingdom come\n\nWhen you feel my heat\nLook into my eyes\nIt's where my demons hide\nIt's where my demons hide\nDon't get too close\n...\n\n"
