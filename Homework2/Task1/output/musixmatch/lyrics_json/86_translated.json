        "Take me back into the arms I love\nNeed me like you did before\nTouch me once again\nAnd remember when\nThere was no one that you wanted more\n\nDon't go you know you will break my heart\nShe won't love you like I will\nI'm the one who'll stay\nWhen she walks away\nAnd you know I'll be standing here still\n\nI'll be waiting for you\nHere inside my heart\nI'm the one who wants to love you more\n...\n\n", 
        "Take me back into the arms I love\nNeed me like you did before\nTouch me once again\nAnd remember when\nThere was no one that you wanted more\n\nDon't go you know you will break my heart\nShe won't love you like I will\nI'm the one who'll stay\nWhen she walks away\nAnd you know I'll be standing here still\n\nI'll be waiting for you\nHere inside my heart\nI'm the one who wants to love you more\n...\n\n",

        "When I was young\nI never needed anyone\nAnd making love was just for fun\nThose days are gone\nLiving alone\nI think of all the friends I've known\nWhen I dial the telephone\nNobody's home\n\nAll by myself\nDon't wanna be\nAll by myself\nAnymore\n\nHard to be sure\nSometimes I feel so insecure\nAnd loves so distant and obscure\n...\n\n", 
        "Used to be that I believed in something\nUsed to be that I believed in love\nIt's been a long time since I've had that feeling\nI could love someone\nI could trust someone\nI said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin'\nI said I'd never let nobody in\n\nBut if you asked me to\nI just might change my mind\nAnd let you in my life forever\nIf you asked me to\nI just might give my heart\nAnd stay here in your arms forever\nIf you asked me to\n\nIf you asked me to\n\nSomehow ever since I've been around you\n...\n\n", 
        "Every night in my dreams\nI see you, I feel you\nThat is how I know you, go on\n\nFar across the distance\nAnd spaces, between us\nYou have come to show you, go on\n\nNear, far, wherever you are\nI believe that the heart does, go on\nOnce more you open the door\n...\n\n", 
        "There were nights when the wind was so cold\nThat my body froze in bed\nIf I just listened to it\nRight outside the window\nThere were days when the sun was so cruel\nThat all the tears turned to dust\nAnd I just knew my eyes were\nDrying up forever\nI finished crying in the instant that you left\nAnd I can't remember where or when or how\nAnd I banished every memory you and I had ever made\nBut when you touch me like this\nAnd you hold me like that\nI just have to admit\nThat it's all coming back to me\nWhen I touch you like this\nAnd I hold you like that\nIt's so hard to believe but\nIt's all coming back to me\n(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)\nThere were moments of gold\nAnd there were flashes of light\nThere were things I'd never do again\nBut then they'd always seemed right\nThere were nights of endless pleasure\nIt was more than any laws allow\nBaby Baby\nIf I kiss you like this\nAnd if you whisper like that\nIt was lost long ago\nBut it's all coming back to me\nIf you want me like this\n...\n\n", 
        "Ziggy, his name is ziggy\nI'm crazy about him\nHe's a boy like no others\nBut I love him, it's not my fault\nEven if I know\nThat he will never love me\n\nZiggy, his name is ziggy\nI'm crazy about him\nThe first time I saw him\nI jumped on him on the street\nI simply told him\nThat I wanted him\n\n...\n\n"
