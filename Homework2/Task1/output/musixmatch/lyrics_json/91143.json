        "I'm sick of feeling like I lost this fight\nI'm sick of graying out the wrongs and rights\nI'm pulling out of here to clear my sights\ntonight\n\nso hear me out baby and dry your eyes\nI'd write it out but it would just seem trite\nI'm pulling out of here with holy spite\ntonight\n\nbut I've got this guitar and I can barely play\n\n...\n\n",

        "How'd I get back here at this?\nAnother sleepless night dismissed\nIt might take a day to get back and figure out what I missed\nHow'd I get back here at this?\nMy knuckles white clenched into fists\nI might need a day to get back and figure out what I missed\n\nI've been losing sleep for days trying to claim\nWhat little stake I have and why my heart betrays\nI'd bail out if it made me free, I'd run but I can barely breathe\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Guess it'll pass here in my bed\nI set a ticking time bomb in my head\nI set it off to punish my transgressions\nAs the poison makes it's way\nI'm watching as my hands begin to shake \nAnd now it's just regrets and every second guess\nNever thought we'd end up here that night when you said\n\n\"the car's out back let's see this through\nThey told me they had all this proof\nI know what I done is wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "Are you okay? Are you all right?\nAnother bad dream kept you up all night\nYou've ground your teeth down to the gums\nYour eyes are bloodshot from staring at the sun\n\nYou say you're okay, you're keeping the pace\nBut the damage done is written all over your face\n\nGiven the chance I'd rather rot in hell\n...\n\n",
