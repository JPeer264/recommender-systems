        "I feel you stare\nWatch me not care\nGlare at the freak\nYou've no control\nFeel your eyes probing me, judging me\nOnly makes me want to explode, just explode\n\nYou don't know me\nBut you fear me\nTainted with ink\n...\n\n", 
        "can you feel it building\ndevastation is on the way\nfeel the hair on the back of your neck\nas the rush begins\n\nyou can't take it away\ni earned this with sweat and blood\nyou can't take it away\ntake what's mine\n\nbreathing new life back into me\nchallenging all the powers that be\n\ncan you feel it slipping\n...\n\n"
