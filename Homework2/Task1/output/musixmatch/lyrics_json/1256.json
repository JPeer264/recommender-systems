        "Walking this high road are warriors from an olden time\nCurse on this land and the days far behind us\nDragons we've slain, rescued many maiden's fair\nAnd no man ever dared break our stride\nOr the brotherhood that binds us.\n\nBrothers are we, marching on the roads of time\nFrom this broken land and the days that defined us\nAll men are free, justice is a sword we hold\nTrusting in the knights noble vow\nIn the brotherhood that binds us.\n\nWhen the broken are strong\n(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)\n...\n\n"
