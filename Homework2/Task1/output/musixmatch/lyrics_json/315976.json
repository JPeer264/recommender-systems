        "Suck it up, going down\n30 seconds till we smash into the ground\nPassengers, have lost their smiles\nSoon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles\nI'm in the shit, knee-deep in it\nI know that this might hurt a bit\nI leave my debts but no regrets\nExcept I wish I took the train\nAnother day, another flight\nThere's not a chance of going down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I just couldn't wait to see you again\nNo, I never, ever turned off on friends\nWell, I thought I heard you say, and I know I feel the rain\nBut I can't give up looks until it's away\n\nNow I just can't take, the way to live my life\nHolding dear the last breath in my lungs\nI know I'll see you again, see you again\n\nDon't take my hand cause I take it away\nAnd I take everything just to take it away\nWell, you can't leave me problems\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I see you look around\nYou're staring, staring out to sea\nI feel them pulling down\nYou touch my hand, it all goes away\nDon't hear a single sound\nbut I feel your breath in front of me\nWith every kiss, I drown\nI feel my body fading to dreams\n\nI don't mind\nand I don't care\nand I'll do fine\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I want to beat you up\nI don't care, 'cause I won't feel sorry\nI want to take you down\nI know that you will see in glory\n\nI want to beat you in\nI'll make you feel my sorrow\nI want to take you out\nI'll come find you tomorrow\n\nEvery time you leave\nI go down\nI'll just wait for you to turn around\nAnd kick your head in\n\nI want you to let it drop\nI don't care, 'cause I won't feel sorry\nI want to mess you up\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Walked four miles on your heart, I don't Like\nI don't Love\nFall down and fall apart, I could scream and you won't hear\nTouching skin, Ruby lips\nIn a dream in a kiss\nCan't see the night, and not your eyes, and you don't notice\nthat it's love that holds you, you can never let it go\nThat it's love that controls you, you can never let it go. Let it go...\nI try words to win your heart, but it doesn't work, It tears it apart\nBreak anything and everything\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
