        "Are you ready for me to be stronger\nI'm keeping my distance, my voice to a whisper\nAre you ready for me to surrender\n'Cause I find in my return\nThere's no need to hide these words\n\nMaybe I'm no angel\nBut I feel like I could fly\nAnd maybe there's no rainbow,\nBut my love for you still shines\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "This is a song for the man who went down\nThis is a song for the man in the ocean\nThis is a heartbeat\nThis is a part of me\n\nEveryone's reading in, in the papers\nFeeling the fear and forgetting it later\nThis is a heartbeat\nThis is a part of me\n\nThis is the first step learning to fall\nThese are the wings, this is the call\nThis is the first kiss, bringing it home\nThis is the breath and the sex and the bones\n\nAnd my hands, are full of life\nAnd the rhythm in you, is the rhythm in me\nAnd my hands, are full of life\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "In the garden, was it peaceful\nDid he show you how the marigolds grew\nWhen he gave you, ...\nWith the thing he only shared with you\n\nI don't remember, what it feels like\nI only know that I don't wanna give it away\nI don't remember, all the details\nI only know that I don't wanna feel it today\n\nIn the garden, in the orange grove\nDid he play the games you liked to play\nBy the fishpond\nAnd the dragon-flies\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
