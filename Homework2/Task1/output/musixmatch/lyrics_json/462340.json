        "Sending out a signal from the city we went\nTowards a future that is greener than the money we spend\nDiscover beaches buried deeper underneath the cement\nLook down through the cracks for the gold that they're hiding\n\nGuarding through the wind that blew through the clothes that we wore\nBut we climb tighter through the hell spawn 'till we reach a new shore\nMore to be nourished by the heat that radiates in the stars\nLike down in the sun and get something for nothing\n\nFirst light\nThe fields are ablaze\nCut through the maze\nLighting up quicker\nEach day never the same\nNever again\nGetting the picture\n\nFirst light\nThe fields are ablaze\nCut through the maze\nLighting up quicker\nEach day never the same\n...\n\n", 
        "You're on the go\nYou're always wanna go\nYou want to go somewhere\nWhere you don't know\n\nAnd when you run\nAnd when I try to run\nYou leave me bent over\nWith a stitch in the road\n\nYou are a maze\nA complex sum\nI've counted all my fingers\nAnd I'm on to my thumb\n\nYou are a storm\nYou are my little storm\nI watch the wind change\nTo find out where you've been blown\n\nPull it up\nAnd steer it up\n...\n\n", 
        "You ride out into the strongest sun and you know\nGonna leave you for dead as the sun over head you dont shun\nthirst comes on and the water is all you want\nBut there's gold in your eyes and it keeps you alive to move on\n\nLoves dart\nNo longer sharp\nThe end is in sight\nbut your aim takes you out of the mark\nLoves dart broken apart\nIf your walkin in circles\nyou'll find yourself back at the start\n\n...\n\n"
