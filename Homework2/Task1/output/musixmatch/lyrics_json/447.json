        "How many of you people out there\nBeen hurt in some kind of love affair\nAnd how many times do you swear that youll never love again?\nHow many lonely, sleepless nights\nHow many lies, how many fights\nAnd why would you want to put yourself through all that again?\nLove is pain, I hear you say\nLove has a cruel and bitter way\n\nOf paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain\nHow could it be that what you need the most\nCan leave you feeling just like a ghost?\nYou never want to feel so sad and lost again\nOne day you could be looking\nThrough an old book in rainy weather\n\nYou see a picture of her smiling at you\nWhen you were still together\nYou could be walking down the street\nAnd who should you chance to meet\nBut that same old smile that youve been thinking of all day\nYou can turn the clock to zero, honey\nIll sell the stock, well spend all the money\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)", 
        "A stone's throw from Jerusalem\nI walked a lonely mile in the moonlight\nAnd through a million stars were shining\nMy heart was lost on a distant planet\nThat whirls around the April moon\nWhirling in an arc of sadness\nI'm lost without you\nI'm lost without you\nThough all my kingdoms turn to sand\nAnd fall into the sea\nI'm mad about you\nI'm mad about you\n\nAnd from the dark secluded valleys\nI heard the ancient songs of sadness\nBut every step I thought of you\nEvery footstep only you\nAnd every star a grain of sand\nThe leavings of a dried up ocean\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
