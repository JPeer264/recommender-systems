I'll never know\nSearching for the place where my heart do belong\nKeep the love inside, I'm gonna find\n\nHere I am, looking back on how we used to be in love\nYou were everything to me\nI realize the better days have gone, and never come back\nBut you're really not the one to blame\n\nIf we could try a little harder\nBut didn't know the right answer\nOne thing I know, my love cannot be tamed\nIt'd never feel the same\nYou see, I'm not your mother\nI'm not your sister or lover\nI'm just a woman with my favorite name And no one be the same\n\nI reach up to the sky\nAnd my soul starts to fly\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
