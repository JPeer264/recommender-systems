        "You said that when we parted I'd be blue and broken hearted\nI laughed and I told though we were through\nLet's talk the whole thing over baby just like we used to do\nI've tasted other girls kisses and I realize what I've been missin'.\n\nAnd understand you found somebody new\nLet's talk the whole thing over baby I can't believe it's true\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
