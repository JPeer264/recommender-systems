        "With my out of tune guitar we walked from bar to bar\nWe were only seventeen but we were going to be stars\nCame across a man who could stop the world with a clap of his hands\nSaid you've got the attitude. Who's got the attitude for rock?\n\nBut she was never going to be a star\nShe would swim rivers\nAnd climb mountains far away\nBut who caught the maid and made her come?\nWhen she was shining like the rising sun\nShining like the rising sun\nYou shine like the sun to me\n...\n\n",

        "On the first night\nIt was an alien\nIn hazy streets\nAnd in hazy streets\nIt became a man\nWho lurked outside\nThe alien\nCame close to me\nCame close to being me tonight\n\nOh nothing could describe\nThe cryptic cross of girls and boys\nOh what useless words\nOh what useless words\n...\n\n", 
        "Well it was a golden night\nLooking like a cowboy\nCoping like a teenage dandy boy\nDressing like the Ripper\nEating like an anorexic child\nWould you come meet me on the outside?\n\nYes it was a golden night\nSleeping in the driveway\nMaking muddy angels cry\nLurking with the street kids\nBut are you the princess in the well\nAnd the down drinks from your eyes\n\nAnd you turn to me\nHeart that I\u2019ve found\nYou\u2019ve woken from your dreams\nAnd the cats in the bad\nBut where the cats sleeping\nAre women sleeping?\n\nDo you remember\n...\n\n"
