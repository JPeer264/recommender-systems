        "Girl I'm in love with you\nThis ain't the honeymoon\nPast the infatuation phase\nRight in the thick of love\nAt times we get sick of love\nIt seems like we argue everyday\n\nI know i misbehaved\nAnd you made your mistakes\nAnd we both still got room left to grow\nAnd though love sometimes hurts\nI still put you first\nAnd we'll make this thing work\nBut I think we should take it slow\n\nWe're just ordinary people\nWe don't know which way to go\nCuz we're ordinary people\nMaybe we should take it slow\nThis time we'll take it slow\nThis time we'll take it slow\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "What would I do without your smart mouth\nDrawing me in, and you kicking me out?\nYou've got my head spinning, no kidding\nI can't pin you down\n\nWhat's going on in that beautiful mind?\nI'm on your magical mystery ride\nAnd I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me\nBut I'll be alright\n\nMy head's under water\nBut I'm breathing fine\nYou're crazy, and I'm out of my mind\n\n'Cause all of me loves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me, I'll give my all to you\nYou're my end and my beginning\nEven when I lose, I'm winning\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
