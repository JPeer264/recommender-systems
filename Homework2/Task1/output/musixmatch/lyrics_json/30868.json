        "And the tears fall like rain down my face again\nOh, the words you wouldn't say\nAnd the games you played with my unfoolish heart\nOh, I should have known this from the start\n\nOh, the winter and spring going in hand in hand\nJust like my love and pain\nHow the thought of you cuts deep within the vein\nBrand new skin stretched across scared terrain\n\nSo I don't wanna be let down\nI don't wanna live that life again\nDon't wanna be lead down the same old road\nSaid, I don't wanna be let down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Oh my sun,\nit won't shine\nIt won't light up the back of my mind\nAnd these fires,\nthey won't burn\nBut to blacken the memories I've earned\nAnd these walls,\nare so thin\nBut they somehow keep holding me in\n'Cause I've pushed,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
