        "I sit and wait\ndoes an angel contemplate my fate\nAnd do they know\nThe places where we go\nWhen we're grey and old\n'cause I have been told\nThat salvation lets their wings unfold\n\nSo when I'm lying in my bed\nThoughts running through my head\nAnd I feel that love is dead\nI'm loving angels instead\n\nAnd through it all she offers me protection\nA lot of love and affection\nWhether I'm right or wrong\nAnd down the waterfall\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Close your eyes so you don't feel them\nThey don't need to see you cry\nI can't promise I will heal you\nBut if you want to I will try\nTo sing this summer serenade\nThe past is done we've been betrayed\nIt's true\nSomeone said the truth will out\nI believe without a doubt\nin you\n\nYou were there for summer dreaming\nand you gave me what I need\nand I hope you'll find your freedom\nfor eternity, for eternity\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Save me from drowning in the sea\nBeat me up on the beach\nWhat a lovely holiday, there's nothing funny left to say\n\nThis sombre song won't drain the sun\nBut it won't shine until it's sung\nNo water running in the stream, the saddest place we've ever seen\n\nEverything I touched was golden\nEverything I loved got broken\nOn the road to mandalay\n\nEvery mistake I've ever made\nHas been rehashed and replayed\nAs I got lost along the way\n\nBom bom bom ba da dup bom bom\nbom bom bom ba da dup bom bom\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
