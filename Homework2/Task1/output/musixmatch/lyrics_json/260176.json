        "Scrolling through my cellphone for the 20th time today\nReading the text you sent me again\nThough I memorized it anyway\n\nIt was an afternoon in December\nWhen it reminded you of the day\nWhen we bumped into each other\nBut you didn't say hi 'cause I looked away\n\nAnd maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life\nAnd maybe I haven't moved on since that night\n\n'Cause it's 12: 51 and I thought my feelings were gone\nBut I'm lying on my bed thinking of you again\nAnd the moon shines so bright but I gotta dry these tears tonight\nCause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
