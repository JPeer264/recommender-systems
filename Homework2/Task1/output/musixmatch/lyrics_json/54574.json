        "If it starts to feel, then we'll just shut it off again\nWe won't convince the jury, we're guilty till we die\nIf it starts to sing, reach in remove the sirens\nThis respirator keeps a countdown to our cancellation\n\nIf it starts to bleed, do not adjust the contrast\nDoctor, deliver us, heaven holds no truth\nFor dreamers like you and I\n\nRemember the day they cut our thoughts\nWe learned to smile from our necks\nThis is the breech of etiquette\nWith wires jutting out from arms\n\nI'll never look at you again\nIf it's only a mirror in the end\nAnd if there's no one after us\nWe'll turn the lights out when we leave\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
