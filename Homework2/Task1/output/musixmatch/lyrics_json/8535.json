        "When all the old consoling places\nLose their charm and change their faces\nThe world becomes too cruel to bear\nAnd something in you starts to tear\n\nWhen nothing seems to be quite worth it\nAnd sleep becomes the only sure thing\nI'm here to help you out of it\nCome and see me for a lift\n\nWe're all close to the end, don't you need a friend?\nHonor your allegiances\nEveryone is drowning in sand, couldn't you use a hand?\nPlease don't make a guess\n\nWhen changes make the world a stranger\nNo one calls and your life's in danger\nIf the money's gone without a trace\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
