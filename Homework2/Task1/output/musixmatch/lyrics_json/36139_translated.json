        "As the sky looks a Tuesday over the school&#39;s communal corridors At four in October just before it gets dark and the smell from the dining hall half-hearted fare and the leaves are glued to the ground Grayish-white clouds Dental Weather Somebody excavator rips up a bike path at the football field and rosehip bushes, rose bushes across the road rosehip bushes I see when I close my eyes and somewhere where I became who I am I see the guitar in the shop icon to truant Lord of the rebellion dream of a higher altitude a pirate ship that blows right into Los Angeles and the stars that glitter and no bastard reach me ever more A single ambition to get the babes from Berga to laugh or cry and escape over the roofs Away from the rulebook, boot tread, brick wall, la isla bonita and the orange chairs stacking on each other ...", 
        "which illuminated the tracks headed home to noon where everything was fashionable around seventy where l\u00e5ghusen stopped and forests took over where I lived, where you lived where I lived and you no earthquakes where we lived, no freeze and no cool but it trembled when you touched me you were seventeen I was sixteen and I skipped everything I just wanted to be with you, I just wanted to be with you now I hear that you are living now and then from a friend, it seems to them that everything&#39;s okay, I wonder if sometime is back there again and maybe wondering about me ...",
