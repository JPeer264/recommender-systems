        "(feat. Stic, Umi, Jamila, Mr. Sunshine)\n\n(Verse 1)\nSlap a white boy. Snuff your landlord\nSmash some windows. Break the camcord\nRob the corner store. Bomb the precinct\nTake the CO. Stab the GT\nPimp the system. Bang for freedom\nFuck the high schools. Burn the prisons\nRide on the record labels. Jump your A&R\nFuck the contract. Push the AR\nGet your bank up. Slip the banks up\nBreak the handcuffs. Invade the campus\nSteal some pampers. Smash the cameras\nFuck the police. Grab the camera\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
