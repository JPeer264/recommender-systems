        "On the summer fall\nand covers me and ... cold memories\nSweet California, I came here\ncoming\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, I was born into a roped-in bed Golden angels float above my head\nMy salvation in a splash of water Oh, save my soul, I'm not a father's? daughter\nOh, they've got it wrong Wish I hadn't, played along\nOh, I wore all I tore on that Sunday Little girls poking through their doorways\nSame old, an act of contrition\nOh, stroke my chest with, every admission\nOh, they've got it wrong\n...\n\n",

        "Met him in the schoolyard, five years old\nTold him I would love him 'til I'm cold\nWe held hands, we took walks\nMy first kiss was at the docks\n\nWhere his dear old daddy works\nWe stopped by to bring him lunch\nTo say hello, to say goodbye\nWas so sweet, I wanna die\n\nHe laid me back upon my bed\nLifted up my tiny head\nPut his lips upon my neck\nGave me just the sweetest peck\n...\n\n"
