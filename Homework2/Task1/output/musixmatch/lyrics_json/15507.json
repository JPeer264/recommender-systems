No, not in Kentucky\nBut these girls 'round here yep, they still love me\nYea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle\nShakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal\nThey like that y'all and southern drawl\nAnd just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'\nFor the boys 'round here\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
