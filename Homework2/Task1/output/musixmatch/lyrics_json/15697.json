        "Stars at my window\nAll say they don't know\nWell it's true\nIn letters of blue\n\nYou say you don't know\nAll there is to know\nWell it's true\nIn letters of blue\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I know there's a space for this\nThere's a niche for this given line \nI know we will make it up they will break it up given time\nI know there's no use in this\nSo throw it all back in\n\nAnd I know it's getting harder for you to choose\nWho will lie, you can prove\nAnd I know it's getting harder to feel secure\n...\n\n", 
        "Everything you do it takes a little while to follow\nIf I can dream of a little silence in the room tonight\nAnd everything she does it seems I'll always want to quarrel\nIf I can dream of a little silence in the room tonight\n\nI see it took a while\nDon't ask, don't waste my time\nHow did it take so long?\n...\n\n",

        "I try to put it over my shoulder\nBut I've got too much to say\nAnd things just don't seem to come out right\nAnd I seem to have got it into my way\n\nAnd I've got to live my life in my strid\nI've got to live my life in style in my stride\nI've got to, got to live my life in my stride\nI've got to live my life in style in my stride\n...\n\n", 
        "You don't get out much\nYou hardly know what to decide\nAnd nothing ever gets you down\n\nYou don't get up to much\nAnd nothing comes of it\nAnd nothing ever gets you down\n\nAnd as the taking rushes in\nI realise what could have been\nAnd everything I ever saw\nCame quickly as it had not before\n\nDo you and I see it the same way\nI think about it every day\n...\n\n", 
        "Have you ever done the right thing?\nIs it heavy on your mind?\nLike a monkey on a mood swing\nChewing on the bark\n\nNot feel satisfaction\nSlice of pure belief\nCan't beat that pure release\n\nHave you ever done the right thing?\nIs it heavy on your mind?\nHere comes another mood swing\n...\n\n", 
        "Small talk on the radio\nIt seems I am going nowhere today\nSmall talk gets you nowhere choose\nBetween a curtain or a star and I'm silent to the dark\n'Cause when I needed someone to talk to\nYou were the only one around\nSmall cost, it pays to be alone\nSmall talk on the radio\nIt seems I am going nowhere today\n(Not today)\nSmall talk gets you nowhere\n...\n\n"
