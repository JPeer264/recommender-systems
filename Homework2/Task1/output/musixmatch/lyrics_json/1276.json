        "Man as a beast\nCame down from the trees\nCrawling around\nSpread his disease\nWas up on the rocks\nPlaying with fire\nInventing his needs\nTo quench the desire\n\nBlood on his hands\nLove on his mind\nHell as a future\nLeaving Heaven way behind\n\nCHORUS\nAll is fair in love and war (na)\nKiss me you fool it's love that we're all dying for\nAll is fair in love and war (na)\nHead for the hills, who knows what all this fighting's for?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "It could happen to you, it could happen to me or anyone\nTreading the mill, coming-of-age, and it falls undone\nHere we stand, are you lost for sure?\nIt could happen to you, it could happen to me or anyone\n\nIt's all about class, have you got a ticket?\nIt's all about worth, should we really buy it?\nIt's about time we shut it all out\nIt's about time we shut it all out\n\nWhen it happens to you, it will happen to me and everyone\nPart of the chain, we're holding hands and I'm holding on\nDare you pick the last fruit from the tree\nIf it belongs to you it belongs to me and everyone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "Every time I wear this shirt I think of you\nAll the dreams I have are always dreamt in blue\nEvery place I find myself I've been there with you\nAbandoned loneliness I ask why, why, why?\n\nWhy did you crucify me?\nStrung up for your love\nWas I so blind to see?\nPushed aside, sterilized, crucified\n\nLooking back I see my faults, was I so wrong?\nTo lock you up inside my arms? I thought I was being strong\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I love the breeze\nThe one I miss is in the breeze\nYou are the breeze\nI love the water\nThe one I miss is in the water\nYou are the water\nI love the life\nThe one I miss is in the life\nYou are my life\nI am possessed\nThe one I miss is my possession\n\nOh, maybe you're still around\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
