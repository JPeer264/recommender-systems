        "I've had nights i will never forget\nI've had nights i will always regret\nBut i can take it on the chin,\nAnd say \"boys will be boys\"\n\nThere's been girls that have stolen our hearts,\nBut the others said they couldn't be prised apart\nWhoever let's us in they say \"boys will be boys\"\n\nWell it's under my skin so i can never win,\nSo thanks a lot\nWe cheat and we lie and we fight\nWe don't cry while we try\n\n...\n\n",

        "Whilst we float on this molten sea\nWe wear our colours so heroically\nWere only living in GMT\nEveryone else is just a refugee\n\nAh I wake up, I'll take up\nIt's about time for a shake up\nWhen pride is blind you know were only stuck in second gear\nSo \u2026 up; never give up\nIt's about time to deliver\nWithout the man who drives you \u2026\nYou know I'm staying in\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Your slouch in smoky corners of this town\n\u2026 Follow you around\nYou drop jokes like they're dragging you down\n\nYou cling onto a vintage way of life\nDon't accept that it should be left behind\nPitiful puns like a constant rewind\n\n\u2026\nJust pointing out what isn't there\n\nAh one step forward, two steps back\nPunch lines like a heart attack\nYour tolerance will never crack\nSo its one step forward, two steps back\n...\n\n", 
        "Invent some stories that start to \u2026\nWell how else are we going to fill our days?\nConspiracies that cut so close and skin\nLets start a club and don't let anyone in\n\nThe free masons\u2026\nWith the devil to pay\nThey'll get you one day\nThe skull and bones are breaking our homes\nWell somehow I don't think so\n\nI'm not suggesting the world is all fair\nThe back scratching and the greed is still there\nI won't insinuate that it's not a crime\n(The whacky feelings are a waste of time)?\n...\n\n", 
        "Eat Drink and be miserable\nWhile it's a miracle that we're still here at all\nAs we sink another belly-full\nAnother cherryfalls bouncin' off the wall\nIf we live in the dead of night\nThen it's a constant fight to be a social lad (?)\nBack tides through darkened rooms\nWith a look of gloom we'll never leave too soon\nWe're so scared of finding out\nWhat scares us and we're growing up\nAnd knowing what it means\nTo be bursting at the seams\nSouled up and fueled up to our ears\nTo leave our fears behind\nWe all know that that just cannot last\n...\n\n", 
        "Were overrated, uneducated\nIt's not easy being so liberated\nSo isolated, its complicated\nBeing loved or being hated\n\nAnd nothing feels quite as real\nAs when you're hanging from the ceiling like an imbecile\nIn the name of peace, love and unity\n\nWe came, we conquered\nWe were outnumbered\nOne for all we will never fumble\nTake a tumble, in the rumble\nAll for one we will never crumble\n\nNo one knows where to go\n...\n\n",
