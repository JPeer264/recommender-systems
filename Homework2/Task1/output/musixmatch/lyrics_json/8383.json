        "No words, no talk\nWe'll go dreaming\nNo pain, no hurt\nWe'll go dreaming\n\nWalk with me, the future's at hand\nHere with us, here where we stand\nWe both know the power of pain\nWe get back up and start it again\n\nWith new hope\nNo place for tears\nLeave behind those frozen years\nCome with me and we'll go dreaming\n\nWe don't know how it can be\nSearching our dignity\nNothing can be as savage as love\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)"
