        "From the Chitlin' Circuit to the Peppermint Lounge\nBeen run off more than once for goin' underground\nWhere I met an old blues-man with a walking cane\nHe wore a stripe suit and used someone else's name\n\nHe said, \"Son I've seen it all\nAnd it's not what you think\"\nHe said, \"There's some tough choices to be made\"\nThen he took a little drink and I heard him say\n\nI do not play no rock and roll\nWould not be moved to sell my soul\nThe demons are out tonight\nRock you sinners\n\nWhoa, the demons are out tonight\nRoll you sinners\nStraight down the line\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We headed straight south in a sundown light\nOn highway 61 through the delta night\nWe shared the backroads with cardsharks and grifters\nTent show evangelists and Luke the Drifter\n\nWhat is lost what is missing\nWhat's been gone way too long\n\nWe had dreams when the night was young\nWe were believers when the night was young\nWe could change the world stop the war\nNever seen nothing like this before\nBut that was back when the night was young\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Got a ticket on the mainline\nI was stranded on the fault line\nI got wasted on the moonshine\nToo far gone\n\nI was walking in the sundown\nI was heading for the breakdown\nWhen you're sleeping on the cold ground\nToo far gone\n\nThere was a cloud hanging over me\nSomething just reached out and grabbed a hold of me\n\nInside of the belly of the whale\nOutside they was beatin on the door\n...\n\n", 
        "One man's trash is another man's treasure\nOne man's pain is another man's pleasure\nPlay too hard, play too rough\nAnd someday someone's gonna call your bluff\n\nTake a stroll off the deep end\nOn the boulevard of broken dreams\nTake a stroll off the deep end\n\nAnd I was just trying to make\nThe right mistake, the right mistake\nI was only trying to make\nThe right mistake\n\n...\n\n",

        "I wonder where it all began\nWas it in a place or in the heart?\nWas it outside in the pouring rain?\nIn the darkness where the dreaming starts\nIf I end up begging like a dog\nDoes it make me any less than you?\nWhy should I stand here and be judged\nWhen we already know the truth?\nThere was a time when I was lost\nCouldn't see the woods for the trees\nHow could I know how much it costs\n'Til I was on my knees?\nFear of falling\nFear of falling\nFear of falling\n...\n\n", 
        "I come to town, my work is done\nWell, I just got off the road\nIt's a long time since I been with someone\n\nI called this lady, so divine\nI asked her and I asked her\nIf she'd like to come out sometime\n\nWe talked about some movie\nAnd we laughed at ourselves\nShe had a way about her like no one else\n\nBut I could see clouds\nWhen I looked in her eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "They say the Axman's coming\nIn a long, black car\nThey said the Axman's coming\nHe plays a mean guitar\n\nWell, he slipped across the border\nWith a hatchet in his hand\nThey said who's that stranger?\nThe one they call the Axman\n\nYou got Duane and Stevie Ray\nAll brothers of the blade\nJimi James and RJ\nAll brothers of the blade\n\nNow when he goes from town to town\n...\n\n", 
        "The letter that I sent to you\nWas it lost in the mail?\nThen tell me why there's no reply?\nWhere can she be tonight?\nAs I lay here in the dark\nAnd I reach for you, I long for you\nBut you've gone like the wind\n...\n\n", 
        "Are you out there?\nCan you hear me?\nCan you see me in the dark?\n\nI don't believe it's all for nothing\nIt's not just written in the sand\nSometimes I thought you felt too much\nAnd you crossed into the shadow land\n\nAnd the river was overflowing\nAnd the sky was fiery red\nYou gotta play the hand that's dealt ya\nThat's what the old man always said\n\nFallen angel\nCasts a shadow up against the sun\nIf my eyes could see\nThe spirit of the chosen one\n\nIn my dream the pipes were playing\n...\n\n",
