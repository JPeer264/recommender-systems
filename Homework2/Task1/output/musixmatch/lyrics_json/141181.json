        "I wake up at the end of a long, dark, lonely year\nIt's bringing out the worst in me\nI hear your voice start breaking in fear\nWhen the lights go down\nAnd I still feel you looking over my shoulder\nYour sinking guilt and approaching nightmare\nAnd I know none of us will survive\nBecause I know everything\n\nAnd my dear I need you to move a little faster\nThis second counts as the rest of your life\nYour final word and an itchy finger\nAnd then it's taken away\nAnd we'll be beaten down without mercy or meaning\nI turn my face to a careless skyline\nI'm searching hard for a sign from heaven\n...\n\n", 
        "(Note: this is the acoustic version of 155 (a 10bpm slower), the lyrics are a little bit different.)\n\nLove\nThis is getting harder\nAnd I can't seem to pick you out of the crowd\nBut you my dear\nHave been discovered a liar\nAnd I'm afraid that this is building up for far too long\n\nAnd this is not the time or place for us speak like this\nSo dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water\n\nIn a different time or place the words can make more sense\nSo dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She's a pretty girl\nShe's always fallin' down\nAnd I think I just fell in love with her\nBut she won't ever remember, remember\n\nAnd I can always find her\nAt the bottom of a plastic cup\nDrownin' in drunk sincerity\nA sad and lonely girl\n\nQuit cryin' your eyes out\nQuit cryin' your eyes out and baby come on\nIsn't there something familiar about me?\nThe past is only the future with the lights on\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey silly girl, I think I got a thing for you\nFrom late nights spent driving in this stolen car\nThe years we wasted living in this desert town\nHaven't broken us so far\n\nHot afternoons we climbed onto the neighbor's house\nBreathed deep and jumped into a waiting sky\nOur bare feet were framed on the horizon\nI felt the future in your eyes\n\nIt was the promise of summer\nWe sealed it with a kiss\nThis time I'll do things proper\nHow did it get to this?\n\nDear you, tonight lets get ahead of ourselves\nCause now, I barely can remember\nYesterday stretched on for so long\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "You said you'd love me\nI said I'd love you too.\nI loved that stupid smile, the stupid things the stupid things you do.\nYou said you needed me,\nI said I needed you too.\nand all that time I wasted just writing songs for you.\nYou said you wanted me,\nI said I wanted you too.\nthe thing you didn't realize was all I want is you.\n\nBroken hearts, the broken strings are all that I've seen, since the day you left me young, naive, and seventeen. Since that day, things have not changed things are still the same like broken hearts and broken strings for me.\n\nYou said you'd love me\n...\n\n", 
        "And my heart hangs from this noose\nLike your footsteps in crowded rooms\nFilled with sweet scents of autumn blooms\nIs this what you imagined?\n\nCatch a glimpse from her empty stare\nHidden eyes behind her auburn hair\nCatch my breath for the smoke to clear\nAnd it's just as it should be\n\nMy best laid plans\nWill build and break your heart\nHer guilty hands\nTear my whole world apart\nMy mind keeps racing\nShe's softly dreaming\nI'm scraped and sober\nBut there's no one listening\n\nAnd we'll wake up in vacant rooms\n...\n\n"
