        "I wish I was a fisherman\nTumblin' on the seas\nFar away from dry land\nAnd it's bitter memories\n\nCastin' out my sweet line\nWith abandonment and love\nNo ceiling bearin' down on me\nSave the starry sky's above\n\nWith light in my head\nWith you in my arms\n\nI wish I was the brakeman\n...\n\n", 
        "While in the merry month of May from me home I started,\nLeft the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,\nSaluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,\nDrank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,\nThen off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,\nCut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;\nBought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs\nAnd fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.\n\nOne, two, three four, five,\nHunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road\nall the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!\n\nIn Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,\nStarted by daylight next morning blithe and early,\nTook a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;\nThats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.\nSee the lassies smile, laughing all the while\nAt me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'\nAsked me was I hired, wages I required,\nI was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.\n\n...\n\n",
