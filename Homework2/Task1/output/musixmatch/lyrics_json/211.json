        "The winds of fortune\nDon't blow the same\nShe had to get out\nAnd make a change\nShe had a kid now\nBut much too young\nThat baby daddy's\n\nOut having fun\nHe said: \"I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know\"\nHis baby mama\nShe ain't so slow\nHe said: \"I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know\"\nI know you wanna hit that\nI know you wanna hit that, hit that\nAll of the world is getting with, I say\nConsequences are a lot, but hey!\nThat's the way\nThat's the way things go.\nOh, oh, oh!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You can do it!\n\nUntil the break of dawn\nLife, life\nCannot go by the letter\nTime, time\nProzac can make it better\nNoise, noise\nAny kind will do\nCan you feel it slip away\nWhen it's all on you\n\nHey\n\nCrime, crime\nRockin' like Janet Reno\nTime, time\nEighteen and life in Chino\nFreud, Freud\nAll along it's true\nWell you'll see there comes a day\nCatches up to you\n\nKnock down the walls, (it's alive in you)\nKnock down the place, (you're alone it's true)\nKnock down the world, (it's alive in you)\nYou gotta keep your head up through it all\nYou're gonna\nBust out on it - original prankster\nBreak out yeah - original yeah\nBust out on it - original prankster\nYou never stop now, stop now\n...\n\n", 
        "You brace and hold it all inside\nIt's more than you can stand\nNo one around even tries\nTries to understand\n\nDon't turn away, don't turn away\nCome out swinging\nCome out alone\nThey're in your way, they're in your way\nBut as long as you're swinging\nStrong then you'll get by\n\nYour pacing's wearing out a line\nRight beside your bed\nThe scene replays a million times\nStuck inside your head\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Maybe in another life\nI could find you there\nPulled away before your time\nI can't deal it's so unfair\n\nAnd it feels and it feels like\nHeaven's so far away\nAnd it feels, yeah it feels like\nThe world has grown cold\nNow that you've gone away\n\nLeaving flowers on your grave\nShow that I still care\nBlack roses and hail Mary's\nCan't bring back what's taken from me\n...\n\n", 
        "Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway\nDodging bullets while you're trying to find your way\nEveryone's around, but no one does a damn thing\nIt brings me down, but I won't let them\n\nIf I seem bleak\nWell you'd be correct\nAnd if I don't speak\nIt's cause I can't disconnect\nBut I won't be burned by the reflection\nOf the fire in your eyes\nAs you're staring at the sun\nAs you're staring at the sun\nAs you're staring at the sun\nAs you're staring at the sun\nAs you're staring at the sun!\n\nHey!\nWhen I ran I didn't feel like a runaway!\nHey!\nWhen I escaped I didn't feel like I got away!\nHey!\nThere's more to living than only surviving!\nMaybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying!\n...\n\n", 
        "Give it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh\nGive it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh\nGive it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh\nAnd all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy\nUno, dos, tres, quatro, cinco, cinco, seis\nYou know it's kinda hard just to get along today\nOur subject isn't cool, but he thinks it anyway\nHe may not have a clue, and he may not have style\nBut everything he lacks, well he makes up in denial\nSo don't deflate, play it straight\nYou know he really doesn't get it anyway\nGonna play the field, keep it real\nFor you no way, for you no way\nSo if you don't break, just overcompensate\nAt least you know you can always go on Ricki Lake\nThe world needs wannabees\nHey, hey, do the brand new thing!\n...\n\n"
