        "Each time I close my eyes.\nThey run at me.\nEyes empty\nScreaming\nIn many ways I am responsible.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Cold desolate winds howl\nAs the rain strikes my flesh alike the blade\nThe leaden sky torn\nFractured by autumn decay\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Entombed by the graven sky I lay\nReflecting within - of deepest emptiness\nEnshrouded by solitude\nAnd endless shades of grey\n...\n\n", 
        "Alone I wonder, toward the unknown\nLost / Cast inwards to the void\nEndless thorns upon my mind\nTorn / Forever plagued by this torment within\n\n...\n\n"
