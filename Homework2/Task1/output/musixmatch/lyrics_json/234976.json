        "Every time I think of pushing you down the stairs\nI lick my lips\nBut don't be upset, its the only way I know how\nTo show you that I really care\nI lie to you every chance I get\nAnd I make it just close enough to the truth\n...\n\n", 
        "In a tiny little cave\nA dog is sleeping on his back\nIron chains around his leg\nBut he's purring loud enough to snap\nI see blood around his snout\nA smile that's bigger than his mouth\nThey come to hurt him every day\nTo stomp him back into a crouch\nThey will never quite cut through\nCause he's got a little piece of you\nThe time gets longer every day\nBut he sits there smiling in his cave\n\nThey will never quite cut through\nwe've have\na little\n...\n\n", 
        "I watch the hands move across your face\nIf i were only big\nMoving slow\nThe longest race\nThe sharpest teeth sink\nAnd i can't move and i can't see\nThe needle clicks through all that lace\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She walked\nHer head hung down\nWatching her feet\nMove on their own\nRestless hands\nGrasped at things\nNo one else could see\nDark circles watched\nHer eyes grow wide\nGuardians of her gaze\nThe high red flush\nOf something wrong\nStained the hills of her face\nMidsummer blazed\nHer rotting cage\nDeath took his hat off\nAt her grave\nScarecrows drape the coloured page\nMarking giant mistakes\n...\n\n", 
        "Skyscrapers left in shade\nThe numbers add up to your chest\nNightmares cling to strange walls\nThe sun will see you now\u2014its the next day\nSpeaking through squares\nHiding faces strange and bright\nArrest near your neck before\nYou can hear leaves breathe\nJust listen\nJust listen\nStolen leaves cemented in\nA quiet place where Plymouths ring\nCurtains fall and bruises form\nBut you can hear leaves\nBreathe if you just listen\nLittle wings play down the street\nOur faces squeezed in glass and tin\nInanimate objects snatch at your skin\nBut you can hear leaves breathe if you just listen\n...\n\n", 
        "I chipped my tooth\nI have a window in my skull\nWrapped up in explosive glass\nThe voices sing beneath\nBelow\n\nI've never seen it unravel\nSo fast in such small hands\nThe secrets stick down in your throat\nThe crimes that make the time go fast\nI slip out of this place\nThe glass cuts through my scabs\nIt's never been so mean to know\nIt all has to come out\nIt all has to come out\n\n...\n\n", 
        "All your sympathys gone\nOnto needles and pins\nAnd the scratch on your cheek\nWhen the dye is cast red\nPillars melted into wood\nShallow breath that you held\nFevered threat in the ground\nRazored memories expelled\nClouds are red above you\nThe rain has stolen a goodbye\nFrom me, it seems\nA moons white iris rings a bell\nAnd shadows head home for a while\nTo dream, and scream and every want\n...\n\n",
