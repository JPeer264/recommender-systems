        "The night was still young, she felt like a million bucks\nLeaving behind the pain and the building blocks\n...Blockin' the sunshine mockin' the young minds duckin' from one time\n...To fly the nest and try the next\nLeave it all, set out on her private quest.\nNot really sure what she lookin' for, but like\nShe knows that there must be more to life\nToo many things tryin' to control her life\nLike the career that she know ain't right\nOr like the boyfriend that told her lies\nOr her jealous friends. Yo it's only right\nThat I'm gone tonight. I wasn't meant to be\nTrapped like this physically and mentally\nOnly thing I'll miss a be my family\nBut I'm on the right path so don't cry for me. Cus I'm\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
