        "Let's make this fleeting moment last forever\nSo, tell me what you're waiting for?\nI'm gonna keep it frozen here forever,\nThere's no regretting anymore.\nIt's worth the wait, even so far away.\nI'm making the night mine until the day I die\nNo lights to brake when you're hanging by fate\nYou know what it feels like when you're dancing blind\nAll alone, just the beat inside my soul\nTake me home, where my dreams are made of gold\nIn the zone where the beat is un-controlled.\nI know what it feels like\nCome on make me feel alive\nFeel alive, feel alive\nFeel alive, feel alive\nFeel alive, feel alive alive alive alive\nAlive!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
