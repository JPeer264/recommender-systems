        "The cats nestle close to their kittens now.\nThe lambs have laid down with the sheep.\nYou're cozy and warm in your bed, my dear.\nPlease go the fuck to sleep\n\nThe windows are dark in the town, child.\nThe whales huddle down in the deep.\nI'll read you one very last book if you swear\nYou'll go the fuck to sleep.\n\nThe eagles who soar through the sky are at rest\nAnd the creatures who crawl, run, and creep.\nI know you're not thirsty. That's bullshit. Stop lying.\nLie the fuck down, my darling, and sleep.\n\nThe wind whispers soft through the grass, hon.\nThe field mice, they make not a peep.\nIt's been thirty-eight minutes already.\nJesus Christ, what the fuck? Go to sleep.\n\nAll the kids from day care are in dreamland.\nThe froggie has made his last leap.\nHell no, you can't go to the bathroom.\n...\n\n"
