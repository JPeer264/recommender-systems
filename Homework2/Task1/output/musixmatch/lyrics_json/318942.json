        "(It's rebel soul music. Can you dig it?\nThen follow me, past those golden gates\nTo a place that's not so picturesque\nBut it's where I rest, it's what I call home.)\n\nSan Francisco California, that's my home\nSoldiers fighting for survivial on our own\nWho has guidance for this life?\nIn a gangster's paradaise?\nWhy must our young be sacrificed? Who has more to gain\nWhen another brother slain trying to do the game\nI cannot stand by, my freedom will not be denied\n...\n\n",

(just might hit it again).\nOpen your eyes don't you be surprised, when we start to win.\n...\n\n",
