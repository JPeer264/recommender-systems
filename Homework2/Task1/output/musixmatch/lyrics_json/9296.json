        "3 A.M. I'm awakened\nBy a sweet summer rain\nDistant howling of a passing Southbound coal train\nWas I dreaming\nOr was there someone just lying here Beside me in this bed?\nAm I hearing things?\nOr in the next room\nDid a long forgotten music box just start playing?\n\nAnd I know (it's a sin putting words in the mouths of the dead)\nAnd I know (it's a crime to weave your wishes into what they said)\nAnd I know (only fools venture where them spirits tread)\n'Cause I know (every word, every sound bouncing 'round my head)\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Bluebird on a telephone line. How are you? I'm feeling fine. Sweetly do I whisper your name. Lonely solo taxi ride to a\n\ncheap motel on the wrong side of the tracks. The facts are tricky to explain. Cold front bearing down, blowing in from\n\nBirmingham. By dawn the window's wet with icy rain. Behind fourteen doors, a sad parade of paramours are throwing little\n\nwhite rocks at sorrow's window pane. Me, I've found someone to love more than the rain. Salvation Army ringing bell,\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "\"Combing My Hair In A Brand New Style\"\n\nI found a blue hair comb with a busted tooth gonna comb out my hair in this telephone booth gonna comb out love, gonna\ncomb out hate gonna get me a new look and I can't wait. I took a lethal dosage of dope in my youth, bit the hook of Jesus\n- Oh! The terrible truth. I swallowed it hard for a damn good while,\nbut now I'm combing my hair in a brand new style. Combing my hair yeah. Combing my hair yeah. Combing my hair yeah.\nCombing my hair in a brand new style. I take a midnight stroll in a Love's supermarket. I like passing the rows of candy\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I say \"God, if you ain't smiling on me,\nthen you ain't no friend of mine.\n\" It's late at night and this motel room's\ndrunk, I been listening to the lonesome wind crying.\nMy best friend once said, \"Jim, what you cling to, that's the thing\nthat you had best forget. For ain't no rose bed ever\ngonna bloom in an untended field of regrets.\" Guess I been busy\nkilling time counting bullet holes in state line signs.\nI led a life of lonely drifting trying to rise above the buzzards\nin my mind. You get dizzy chasing 'round the tail of\nwhat you need to leave behind. Oh sweet Jesus, won't you help me?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "\"Borrowed Wings\"\n\nThat night we drank wine from the crazy well. Shot a shotgun out the window of our automobile. We was young, we was wild\nand we sure had our fun. Until the sheriff caught up with us and we tried to run. Now we return to Earth on borrowed wings\nlifted from the shoulders of sweet dreaming angels. Now the world beyond the world we never will reach, 'cause you can't\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "If Jesus drove a motor home, I wonder would he drive pedal to the metal, or real slow? Checking out the stereo. Cassette\n\nplaying Bob Dylan, motivation tapes. Tricked up Winnebago, with the tie-dye drapes. If Jesus drove a motor home... If Jesus\n\ndrove a motor home, and he come to your town, would you try to talk to him? Would you follow him around? Honking horns at\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Objects in motion tend to stay that way. You can't waste the whole damn day loving what you need to cast away. Case in\n\nPoint, just yesterday I found a suitcase full of love letters floating down a cool brown river. Unsigned and undelivered,\n\nThey set my mind to wandering as to the history of the unknown writer. Did she marry, did she run, was she old, was she\n\nYoung? Was her heart undone by the cruel business of loving? These objects in motion. These objects in motion. Objects in\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "\"Buzzards Of Love\"\n\nWonder if you know, what you see ain't what you get. Wonder have you learned a dirty word - did you forget? 'Cause\nthere's talk on the street... say sugar taste sweet... but it'll tear you apart... when what's easy on the eyes... is hard on the\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "\"Alabama Chrome\"\n\nSunday I am young and wild, Monday I go lame. Tuesday I start twitching, Wednesday I'm insane. Thursday I lay dying,\nFriday I'm quite dead. Saturday I get carried away by things better left unsaid. But heaven ain't no place, brother, and\nlove ain't no word sister. And prison ain't no building made of iron bars and stone. You can seek the rhyme and reason,\nbut in the realm of the unknown you won't catch no true reflections in that \"Alabama Chrome.\" For there's mountains you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Oh where are we going? Oh where have we been? Our hush-a-bye angel, she's safe and tucked in. I drive around town, while\n\nyou sit and watch the rain. There's what you think with your heart and what I feel with my brain. For those who plant\n\nnothing but the seeds of the falling there is a phone booth in heaven that no one is calling. It sits on a highway that\n\nleads nowhere. I'll drop you a line next time I find myself there. Remembering them days, how we wore our weakness well.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
