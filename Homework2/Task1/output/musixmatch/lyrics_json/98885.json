        "I was listening to the ocean\nI saw a face in the sand\nBut when I picked it up\nThen it vanished away from my hands\n\nI had a dream I was seven\nClimbing my way in a tree\nI saw a piece of heaven\nWaiting impatient for me\n\nAnd I was running far away\nWould I run off the world someday?\nNobody knows, nobody knows\nAnd I was dancing in the rain\nI felt alive and I can't complain\nBut now take me home\nTake me home where I belong\nI can't take it anymore\n\nI was painting a picture\nThe picture was a painting of you and\nFor a moment I thought you were here\nBut again, it wasn't true\nAnd all this time I have been lying\n...\n\n"
