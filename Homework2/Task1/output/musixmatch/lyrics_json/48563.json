        "What's wrong with me?\nI get lonely in a crowd\nEveryone is smiling\nBut I make myself left out\n\nI've got an imaginary shield around me\nBut nobody's ever really gotten through\nI keep thinking that they're gonna break me free\nBut they never do (no)\n\nWhen somebody's knockin\nWhen somebody wants me\nWhen somebody's trying to love me completely\nI get scared\nDon't know how it works\nWill somebody save me?\nOr will I get burned?\nDon't wanna get burned\n\nThere's thickness in the air\nWeighing heavy on my heart\nWhy can't I just fit in?\nWhy can't I do what everyone else does?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's tuesday morning and there is nothing I'd rather do\nTraffic Jams and Train Cars just to get to you\nmaybe we would walk around\njust showing me your home town\neven if we did nothing... its anything...\nAnd everythings alright\nwhen your with me tonight\nEverything alright\ncause your with me tonight\nSunday morning Im still lying next to you\n...\n\n", 
        "So put your car in drive and\nJust drive away from here\nYour tears are soaked on my\nShoulder and your lipstick is dried\nIn my ear\nThree lonely winding ways will surely straighten out my head\nI've come to realize that\n...\n\n", 
        "You've set me right tonight\nI'll find myself somewhere\nOutside the lines\nBut now everywhere\nSeems like nowhere\nSince that day i heard you say \"i\nThink\nIts time i've let you go\"\nWell maybe, someday we'll\n...\n\n", 
        "you dont want this anymore\ncause there is no sense in holding\n\nto peace of mind thats stolen\nfurthermore, opinions and thoughts of you\nhave turned into, maybe nothing of the kind\nI feel I've wasted so much emotion, words, and time\n\nnow its plain to see\nthat you have given up on everything\n...\n\n", 
        "This pressures to much to take\nEvery bend reaches a brake\nWell thats a sore subject\nTime to get your head checked\nYou can't keep dwelling on every moment that slipped by\nWith every sunsets a sunrise\n\nWe don't know\nWhere We go\n(just turn up that radio)\nSing along to your favorite songs\nAnd hope these interstates will go on and on and on\n\nSo long Sincerity\n...\n\n", 
        "summer nights are growing cold\naugust goodbyes are getting close\nso lets leave all of the windows open tonight\nleave us no choice but to cuddle close\nand we'll kiss all night\nwake tomorrow morning with chapped lips on our faces\nI will pass on Vaseline and for all to see, I'll wear these\nbattle-scars burned by your taste\n\nbecause I want to feel like this forever\n...\n\n", 
        "I feel deserted in her eyes\nlike I'm floating in red seas\nset your sails, catch a breeze\nUnder early morning sky's\nshe drives far away from me\nset your sails, set me free\n\nshe rolls the window down and screams an awful sound\ntwenty miles down she's found her voice\nIt travels in the wind\nbreaks my walls down, breaks them in\n...\n\n", 
        "And did you ever wish you saved\nall the lessons that you gave\ncus I'll save them all to you\nand did you ever hope our eyes\ncould be spared of all your lies\nand I've got news for you\nor maybe you were just drained (Just drained)\n\nSo now I'm sure I'd like to make\nyou guna feel the way I felt that day\nIf only I could do that to you\nmaybe it would prove\n...\n\n", 
        "I've turned the pages on the story of my life\nIt's been by far the worst chapter I could imagine me to write\nAbout a promise for forever\nBroken down\nPut back together\nIt's safe to say\nThere's no chance in you this time\n\nJust walk away tonight\nAnd never say goodbye\nYou can't say that I'm the one who's changed\nCause I've been this way forever\nAnd forever I will stay the same\nYou can't say that I'm the one who's changed\nYou can't say that I'm the one\nYou can't say that I'm the one who's changed\n...\n\n", 
        "So say goodbye today\nI'll never have to feel alone\nAnd take, everything from me\nYou never have to feel alone\n\nJust by set this conversation\nIt's your congrtulations\nLeft me bare and burnt out\nWith a broken heart and a broken mind\nBut it all heals in time\nSit down, relax, fall and drown\n\nSo say, goodbye, today\nYou never have to feel alone\nAnd take, everything from me\nYou never have to feel alone\n\nBring out to me\nBring out your best\nWe've made it such a mess\nThere's heavy breathing on the side lines\nSo take a step, step timidly\n...\n\n", 
        "And there's villians in their closets \nAnd theives beneath their beds\nAnd business men in mirrors \nWith guns against their heads\nStepstools beneath their ankles \nNooses tied around their throats\nSharpening their switchblades \nAnd sighting in their scopes\nSinging no one sleeps tonight \n'Till everything is burned \nAnd everyone is sacrificed\nNo one sleeps tonight \n'Till everything is burned \nAnd everyone is\n...\n\n", 
        "somewhere beyond these unforgettable days\nwe can find it in ourselves to live our lives again\nyour misplaced in time, authoring your tragedy\nbut your dreams and lies\nnever fill the voids in me\n\nso the show goes on without you\nfoundations fall that were once built strong around you\nand it shows all around you\nfoundations fall that were once built strong\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Its 6am, open roads and open skies\nUnder this Whyoming sunrise\nA close encounter with\nThe emptiness of nothingness\n21 years out on the road from our small hometowns\nYou could hear a whispering in the wind\nFilling me with confidence\n\nSo I took advice from the headlights\nIt made it clear it opened up my eyes\nAnd it opened up my mind\n\n[Chorus]\n...\n\n", 
        "september, autumn skies are closing in\nand the mistake your reality\nat best has left you broken\nwith wounds that re-open\non every brink of sleep\nand a fire in your heart\nthat never dies and never seizes\n\nand it goes up in flames\nyour world is torched away\nso let it go up in flames\n...\n\n", 
        "This puzzled look you stare to me says\n\"You put me back together\"\nHer head's down, she waits impatiently\nScattered in my heart, torn up and ripped apart\nIt's ripped apart.\nAnd I know, I should have known\nBy the times she looked at me\nBrace yourself\nStrength finds a place in me\n...\n\n"
