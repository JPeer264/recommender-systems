        "Another time\nYou'll see my face\nWhen you're not looking\nAnd run to me\nTo blindly ask\nWhat's on my mind\n\nAnother time\nYou'll find me in a game\nAnd ask if you can stay and play along\nBut another time has come\nAnd already gone\n...\n\n", 
        "Along a busy street I find\nA bottle tossed away\nI hold it to my eyes\nAnd change the color of the day\n\nA broken neck\nA jagged edge\nSurrounds a changing scene\n\nAnd passing strangers smile at me\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you like to go?\nWould you like to go back to the land that you and I once knew?\n\nWhere prophets play electric guitars\nPlugged into the stars that shine for you and I\nYour twinkling eye invites me to bring you\n\nWould you like to go?\n...\n\n", 
        "Just like the breath of spring\nYou came my way\nI heard a bluebird sing\nBut not today\n\nCause it`s wintertime\nAnd the leaves are brown\nSince you went away\nMy world fell down\nMy world fell down\nMy world fell down, fell down\n\nI see your suitcase lyin`\nPacked up to go\nI stop myself from cryin`\nHow I don`t know\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a world where I can go\nAnd tell my secrets to\nIn my room, in my room, my room\n\nIn this world I lock out\nAll my worries and my fears\n...\n\n"
