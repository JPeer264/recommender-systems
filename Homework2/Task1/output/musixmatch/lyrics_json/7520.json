        "I love the way you walk,\ni love the way you talk\nWith your mouthful\nThe way you park on the sidewalk\nThe way you are in the car\nI'll make you love the way I behave\nOn my bad days\nShow you the trigger to my bitch switch\nAnd how to play with my witch stitch\nKiss my dirty feet\ni'll take you out for dinner\nLaugh at my jokes\nI wanna sit on your back\nClose my eyes\nTake your pulse\nIt's 120\nAnd it's rising\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "(N. Cherry/C. McVey/G. Barlow)\nWake up without a blink\nTo an even pace where nothing moves\nExcept the pressure from a funky saturday\nDropping like bricks on my head\nOr over the milkyway\nStarlit electric beams had only just touched me\nI must have dreamt myself astray\nThe only milkyway I have is in the middle of the day\nChorus:\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Born to the way things work\nTold that's the way things are\nYou know when you never kiss at all\nTill you got the kiss of life, right\nIt's uplife and real\nSomething to die for\nSomething to live for\nSomething to fight for\nAnd still you wait in vain\nWhen you close your mind to change\n\nLonging for tomorrow to come\nAnd I'm still waiting\nAnd I'm still waiting\n\nAnd then we understand\nThat's the way things are\nWe look as though we don't believe a word\nBut that should be enough truth\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
