        "Can't fight! There's no escaping the facts\nI tried to help but I failed\nTo solve the problems so much\nOf good intentions\n\nI want my wasted hours back\nAnd I want my head to clear\nAnd I have this bad taste in my mouth\nFrom late nights and bad films\n\nGet up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!\nGet up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
