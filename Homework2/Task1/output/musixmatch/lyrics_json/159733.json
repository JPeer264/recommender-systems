        "I wish to feel smaller\nunder your sheets.\nI wish for the whole truth\nevery time you speak.\nI'm thinkin' about how you care half as much for me\nAs I watch you arrive, smoke cigarettes, sleep...\n\nAnd I guess it doesn't matter what I say or what I seem\nYou stuck what I felt for you in the pocket of your jeans\nIgnoring me the morning after isn't enough\nand I swear I'm gonna cry.\nI'm sick of tryin' to be tough.\n\nAnd my blood won't stick\nTo the confines of my veins.\nAnd your heart\nIs gonna tear mine away.\n\nAnd I wish to feel smaller under your hands,\nthough you seem satisfied as you slip mine\ndown your pants.\nAnd I'm thinkin' about how you care half as much for me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
