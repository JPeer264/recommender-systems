        "Here's to every time that you rock a boat\nHere's to every word that you ever wrote\nThere were clues but it was never clear\nYou've got to choose your own way out of here\n\nI could say anything you need, anyone you knew,\nAnything you see, anything you say,\nAnything you need, anyone you knew, anything you\nIt would be this it would be this.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The fire, the wine, the bed and you\nIn this crimson light I find the truth\nAnd truth is like a punch or two\nIt hits you hard, it knocks you through\n\nSo I get on the road and ride to you\nI get on the road and ride to you\n\nKiss like a fight that neither wins\nOne tender payment for our sins\nYou are the drug that I can't quit\n...\n\n", 
        "And by the look in your down turned eyes\nYou've had enough of these angry skies\nAnd I can't wait just like you can't wait\nTil we're out past familiar gates\n\nYour hand it's freezing cold... on my face\nJust like the winter snow... that covers up this place\n\n...\n\n"
