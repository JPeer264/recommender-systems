        "Heart beats fast\nColors and promises\nHow to be brave?\nHow can I love when I'm afraid to fall?\nBut watching you stand alone\nAll of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow\nOne step closer\nI have died every day waiting for you\nDarling, don't be afraid\nI have loved you\nFor a thousand years\nI'll love you for a thousand more\nTime stands still\n\nBeauty in all she is\n...\n\n", 
        "It's like a little piece of heaven\nWhen you stay\nYou make me feel like it's all\nOkay\nAnd now I know that the sun\nWill only shine\nWhen the clouds go away\nCause thats how you make me feel\nThats how you make me feel today\n\nAnd you're like a little piece of candy\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got a heart for sale\nIt's a little worn, and torn, and pale\nIf it beats, then I'll make you a deal\nI'll give it to you for free,\nIf you can love it, carefully,\nAnd get, it away from me.\nI know that I\nShould keep it for a while\nAnd learn what it\nMay need to survive\nBut I can't, no I won't\nMake it through\nOne more loveless bruise\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I know I can't take one more step towards you\n'Cause all that's waiting is regret\nDon't you know I'm not your ghost anymore\nYou lost the love I loved the most\n\nI learned to live half alive\nAnd now you want me one more time\n\nAnd who do you think you are?\nRunnin' 'round leaving scars\nCollecting your jar of hearts\nAnd tearing love apart\nYou're gonna catch a cold\nFrom the ice inside your soul\nSo don't come back for me\nWho do you think you are?\n\nI hear you're asking all around\nIf I am anywhere to be found\nBut I have grown too strong\n...\n\n"
