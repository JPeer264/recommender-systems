        "So long the path\nSo hard the journey\nWhen I will return\nI cannot say for sure\nUntil then the nights will be long and\nSleep will be full of dark dreams and sadness\nBut don't weep for me\nJust think of me with love and fondness\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",

        "In the city of nights\nIn the city of nights\n\nAs the lights go on there's a magic glow to the sea\nBut as we move through the streets we can feel the fear\nAs night goes on there's a tragic show in the city\nThose songs are on the ebb and mixed with tears\n\nAnd down the alleyway the drunks are fighting\nOver who will have the last drink from the can\nIt all seems so romantic in the lying\nBut what a sad existence for a man\n\nThere's speeders, dealers, girls of easy virtue\nLaughter, lies and lovers sparkling eyes\nGlitter boys and girls out for the dancing\nGood time girls and boys out for the highs\n\nAnd there's a hotel on hope street\nWhere the concierge will understand your needs\nShe doesn't care your colour or religion\nAnd she always has a room for you and me\n\nIn the city of nights\nIn the city of nights\n\nThere's an oriental flavour in the city\nMarta haries, saris and sarongs\nIncense candles, prayer and incantations\nGolden girls arabia in their song\n\nIt seems the doors are closed on the asylums\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613213962)",
