        "I toss card I write a few lines about how I suffer and that you are in my heart not somewhere on the bottom only in the central the point if you do not believe themselves so try not know where it all goes - probably far Such love is uninterrupted river But when something breaks arises a huge dam can not stand the feeling that I&#39;m alone and you&#39;re there alone! The next few lines I want to express my pain My name is Damian and I want to love your dick I do not know what to do because I still&#39;m running out of options I&#39;m trying everything no matter how I finish I have no fear that today I will die for love ...", 
        "They say rap's like a trap\nSo I'm looking for the mat to the back door\nSometimes I sit and wonder\nWhat the fuck I'm rapping for\nSo many cats talented\nThat never had a chance in it\nNot to mention niggas tryna damage it\nCold hearted vandalists\nFucking up the culture\nThey acting like this cool (?) shit will rap for the advantages\nMaking the game scandalous\nStrand's so far from the art\nYou start to wonder\nIf they ever was a fan of it\nI'm digging in the crates\nWith the candles lit\nLooking for a record to describe my anger\nSo I can sample it\nCondense my feelings\nInto sixteen bars\nAnd try to sugarcoat my quotes\nSo they won't seem raw\nWhat y'all folks' dreams are\n'Cus all the video shows\nIs hoes jocking\nNiggas knocking on\nNow the young'uns\nWant a piece of the pie\nSo the devil let's them starve\nAnd start feeding 'em lies\nNow try to digest that\nThe shit out when niggas\nI'm trying to get out\n...\n\n", 
        "Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTravelling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off a my soul\nPicture me sitting in front of eighty-eight keys trying to escape\nFrom a shady place where babies blaze trees on a daily day\nTryna get they gravy straight to floss cause told me homey watch it\nThese ladies play dirty games with you get to grinding\nWhere niggas pitch as quick as Nolan Ryan\nHolding iron, blowing smoke, elope in fire, flame spitting\nThe game is just a way to escape\nAnd our pain is just a way we can relate to folks crying\nFinding ways I can make a difference\nBut fuck wishing on a star\nCause the percentage of getting what you envisioned is small\nAnd the stars barely shine in the city, so we\u2019re blinded\nBy the man-made bright lights, making my eyes shifty\nFeel me out, hear me now, crying childs of the ghetto\nLettin go a beautiful sound, it\u2019s kinda falsetto\nHello hell, welcome to L.A. where devils that dwell play\nThey meddle with metal and letting every shell spray\nUntil day dawns, I make songs for the long road travelers\nAnd lost souls after us\nSpitting lyrics vicious like I\u2019m mad as fuck\n...\n\n", 
        "ooooooohhhhh girl, baby\nOh baby\n\nTalk about love, talk about trust\nTalkin' 'bout forever baby\ntalk 'bout us\n\nI give you my word, stick to my guns\nBelieve me when I say it baby\nIts just begun\n\nYou don't understand, oh girl\nThe full intent of my plan\n\nBaby I want to be your soul provider\nBaby I want to stay that way\n...\n\n",
