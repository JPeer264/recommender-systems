        "Never on a Sunday when the church is full of people\nAnd the bells are ringing in the steeple, la la...\n\nOh, you can kiss me on a Monday\nA Monday, a Monday is very very good\nOr you can kiss me on a Tuesday\nA Tuesday, a Tuesday in fact I wish you would\nOr you can kiss me on a Wednesday\nA Thursday, a Friday, and Saturday is best\nBut never never on a Sunday\nA Sunday, a Sunday 'cause that's my day of rest\n\nCome anyday and you'll be my guest\n...\n\n", 
        "What now my love?\nNow that you left me\nHow can I live through another day?\nWatching my dreams turning to ashes\nAnd my hopes into bits of clay\nOnce I could see\nOnce I could feel\nNow I am numb\nI've become unreal\nI walk the night\nWithout a goal\n...\n\n", 
        "One more sunrise\nOne more day to get through\nOne more sunrise\nOne more day without you\nAnd those lips that I knew could never be true\n\nOne more sunrise\nNow the heartaches begin\nWandering, wandering\nThrough the places we've been\nHoping that I can keep my sunnyside grin\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh yeah I tell you somethin'\nI think you'll understand\nWhen I say that somethin'\nI want to hold your hand\nI want to hold your hand\nI want to hold your hand\n\nOh please say to me\nYou'll let me be your man\nAnd please say to me\nYou'll let me hold your hand\nNow, let me hold your hand\nI want to hold your hand\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Love me with all of your heart\nThat's all I want, love\nLove me with all of your heart\nOr not at all\nJust promise me this\nThat all you'll give me\nAll your kisses\nEvery winter\nEvery summer\nEvery fall\n\nWhen we are far apart\nOr when you're near me\nLove me with all of your heart\nAs I love you\nDon't give me your love\nFor a moment\nOr an hour\nLove me always\n...\n\n", 
        "Tall and tan and young and handsome\nThe boy from Ipanema goes walking\nAnd when he passes, each girl he passes goes ahah\nWhen he walks, he's like a samba\nHe swings so cool and sways so gently\nThat when he passes, each girl he passes goes ahah\n\nOh, but I watch him so sadly\nHow can I tell him I love him\n...\n\n", 
        "You wander around\non your own little cloud\nwhen you don't see the why\nor the wherefore.\n\nOoh, you walk out on me\nwhen we both disagree\n'cause to reason is not what you care for.\n\nI've heard it all a million times before.\nTake off your coat, my love, and close the door.\n\nDon't sleep in the subway, darlin'.\nDon't stand in the pouring rain.\nDon't sleep in the subway, darlin'.\nThe night is long.\nForget your foolish pride.\n...\n\n", 
        "Nothing you could say could\nTear me away from my guy\nNothing you could do cause\nI'm stuck like glue to my guy\n\nI'm sticking to my guy\nLike a stamp to a letter\nLike birds of a feather\nWe just stick together\n\nAnd I'll tell you from the start\nI can't be torn apart from my guy\n\nNothing you can do could\nMake me untrue to my guy\nNothing you could buy would\nMake me tell a lie to my guy\n\nI gave my guy my word of honor\n...\n\n", 
        "Every day when the work is behind you\nand the shop and the store put the lock on the door,\njust get away where your worries won't find you.\nIf you like, well, I'll tell you more.\n\nDon't let the day get the better of you.\nWhen the evening comes, there's so much to do!\nYou'd better put on your best and wear a smile.\nCome along with me a while\n'cause I tell you\n\nCHORUS:\nI know a place\nwhere the music is fine and the lights are always low!\nI know a place\nwhere we can go.\n...\n\n", 
        "Natural love (natural love)\nIt's natural love (natural love)\nHoney, you and I\nLying in the midnight sun\n\nI say it's natural love (natural love)\nIt's natural love (natural love)\nSo hold me close\nOur love has just begun\n\nOh, darling, it was good for me\nI know it was good for you\nWe'll make the best\nA little better tonight\n\nA whispered word, a tender kiss\nI tremble when we touch like this\nWell, it's so good, so strong, so right\n\nNatural love (natural love)\nIt's natural love (natural love)\n...\n\n"
