        "Started I shut my eyes\nOne kiss went out of sight\nGrew not a thought apart\nThe ends not quite the start\n\nAnd you can't say the words\nSo I don't know where it hurt\nI'll tuck you up in tight\nAnd hope you'll wake up mine\n\nLike the blood without a stone\nKeeps me coming back for more\n\nStop Hey! Don't walk away!\nYou're going out of sight\nIn the morning light.\nStop Hey! Don't walk away!\nYou're going out of sight\nCan we last the night.\n\nYour lips are looking dry\nNo longer speak we sigh\nAnd the reasons why we're her\nHave never been made clear\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "We left on a note, but no ones singing.\nBetter off alone.\nMade no excuses, you made your escape.\nNo explanation. How dare you.\nOut of my bed and off down the stairs. The back of your head was a clear view.\n\nFour floors apart, but we just keep missing.\nTwo worlds in half, and I'm still wishing.\nFour floors apart, and I'm still wishing to see your face again.\nWonder just what I'd say.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
