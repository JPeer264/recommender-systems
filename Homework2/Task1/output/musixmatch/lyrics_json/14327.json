        "I play out my role, why I've even been out walking,\nthey tell me that it helps, but i know when i'm beaten.\n\nAll those lonely films, and all those lonely parties,\nbut now the feeling is off screen,\nand the tears are real, not acted anymore.\n\nOooh im all mixed up inside, I want to run but i cant hide,\nhowever much we try, we cant escape the truth and the fact is,\n\ndont matter what i do, dont matter what i do,\nit dont matter what i do, it dont matter what i do,\nit dont matter what i do, cos i end up hurting you.\n...\n\n", 
        "When I find you waiting hours; oh,\nYou're there to save my life for our obvious goal\nWe've got a headstart for happiness\nFor our part, guess we must be blessed\nFor this feeling to be so strong\nTell me is that so wrong?\nThe space betweeen us for days has been so far;\nI've spent a lonely week\nNow I wanna be where you are\nWe've got a headstart for happiness, for our part\nGuess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside\n...\n\n", 
        "Your hair hangs in golden steps\nYou're a bonafide, in every respect\nYou are walking through streets that mean nothing to you\nYou believe you're above it and I don't really blame you\nMaybe that's why you speak like a child\nThe things you're saying like I'm so free and so wild\n\nAnd I believe it when you look in my eyes\nYou offer me a life and never lies\nLeast only the kind to make me smile\n\nYour clothes are clean and your mind is productive\nIt shops in stores where only the best buy\nYou're cool and hard, never sound like a lecher\nIt's probably true but at least there's no lecture\nI really like it when you speak like a child\n...\n\n",

        "Empty hours\nSpent combing the street\nIn daytime showers\nThey've become my beat; \nAs I walk from cafe to bar\nI wish I knew where you are; \nBecause you've clouded my mind\nAnd now I'm all out of time\nEmpty skies say try to forget\nBetter advice is to have no regrets; \nAs I tread the boulevard floor\nWill I see you once more; \n...\n\n", 
        "It's no good praying to the powers that be\n'cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree\nNo good praying to the pristine alters\nWaiting for the blessing with holy water\nThey like the same old wealth in the same old hands\nMeans the same old people stay old people stay in command\nWatch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round\nThey got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound\nWatch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round\nAs you fall from grace and hit the ground\n\nToo much money in too few places\nOnly puts a smile on particular faces\nSaid too much power in not enough hands\nMakes me think get rich quick; take all I can\nThey're too busy spending on the means of destruction\nTo ever spend a penny on some real construction\n\nWatch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round\nThey amuse themselves as they fool around\nWatch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round\nDo like they say, make them vulnerable\n\nNo good looking to the empire corners,\nCivilization built on slaughter\n...\n\n",
