        "You're a rich girl and you're goin' too far\nCause you know it don't matter any way\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nYou can rely on the old man's money\n\nIt's a bitch, girl but it's goin' too far\nCause you know it don't matter any way\nSay money, money won't get you too far\nWon't you far\n\n...\n\n",
