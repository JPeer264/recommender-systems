        "One eye on the shadows, protecting his fellows\nFrom sun up to the moon on his back\nSent the villains to Hades, a hit with the ladies\nA stallion in the sack\n\nYou can't get your life back\nWhen right follows left Jack\nThe more you see the less you know\nWhen others would leak it, his service is secret\nPlays God when it's your time to go\n\nQueen and country, safe and sound\nWith villains six feet underground\nAnd no one knows 'cause no one's found\nAny trace of a man for all seasons\nLoves them and leaves them alone, so alone\n\nAnd you and I wouldn't have a clue\nWho's doing what, why, when and who?\nUp a creek with no canoe\nWatch out for the man for all seasons\nLoves them and leaves them alone, so alone\nBut safe at home\n\nFrom the House of Lords, saving Norfolk broads\n...\n\n", 
        "didn't mean to take you for granted\ndidn't mean to show i don't care\ndidn't mean to throw away\nthis once in a life time of chance\nbeing with you\n\nand i'll drive for two hours\nto bring butterfingers\ni don't mind the distance\nthis kismets a dance\n\nthis time i'll surrender my everything\n...\n\n", 
        "If often in the still of night\nThoughts turn out twisted\nWell unwind\n\nUncurl and lay the worries of the world\nBy any fire you find\nDreamers only believers in their sleep\nUnder archievers take a leap\nTell her the secrets that you keep\n\nSo close and yet too far out\nMaybe someday you'll hear\nSweet somethings whispered softly\nInto your ear\n\nTo those with afflictions\nProne to addictions\nTo users and to losers\n...\n\n",
