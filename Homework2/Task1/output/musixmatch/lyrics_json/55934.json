        "Back in the saddle again, I feel alive\nI was slowly fading\nAnd all that I wanted to be but I never been\nWas slowly dissipating\nAnd I believe in miracles\nYou know I've seen them time and time again\nNow this one's mine\nA wasted life was the road that I was on\nI was running blind into the unknown\nJust in the nick of time You found me at my worst\nAnd brought me home\nThe battle starts in your mind then straight to the soul\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "If my heart is overwhelmed\nAnd I cannot hear Your voice\nI will run on to what is true\nThough I cannot see\nIf the storms that come my way\nAnd the road ahead gets steep\nI will lift these hands in faith\nI will believe\nI remind myself of all that You've done\nAnd the life I have because of Your Son\nLove came down and rescued me\nLove came down and set me free\nAnd I am Yours, I am forever Yours\nMountains high or valley low\nI sing out, remind my soul\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

'Cause I feel so far away\nAnd You've always known exactly what to say\nBut tonight I've really crossed the line\nI've let You down but You never said goodbye\nI know You'll be here tomorrow\nWhen everyone else has come and gone\nI want to run, I want to hide, wish I could disappear tonight\n'Cause I feel like I'm just one mistake away\nAnd I know You'll never leave but it's so hard to believe\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Striking the match that burns me\nPouring more gasoline onto the flame\nI'm to blame\nI'm all alone and bleeding\nAnd every self-inflicted wound's in vain\nAm I addicted to my pain?\nAnd I can't look without You here\nWill You wash away all my fear?\nAddicted to my pain\n'Cause I can't see and I can't feel\nGod, I'm praying none of this is real\nAddicted to my pain\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
