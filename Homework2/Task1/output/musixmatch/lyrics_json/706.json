        "I'm Jimmy Pop here in a jiffy heat me up and add oil\nI'm like a zit a wart a corn a cyst a festerin' boil\nI get under your skin and I sebaceously form\nI'm as deep as the plot to an amateur gay porn\nKeep ya hungry for more like Bangladesh\nThen I'll bjorg da bjorg da bjorg ya like the Swedish Chef\n'Cause I'm one of a kind and kinda hard to find\nKinda like an Injun without his fire water wine\nI'm like Schneider One Day At A Time\nI'm feelin' like Bob Vila nailin' up your behind\nTo my wall like Daniel-san does\nI'm waxin' on I'm waxin' off I'm waxin' just because\nI get wired like Western Union and I got to be me\nAnd I got more balls than the daily lottery\nLike hemorrhoidal itch yo you can't ignore me\n'Cause I'm more tongue in cheek than a lesbo orgy\n\nAnd I don't give a damn if you don't like me\n'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me\n\nAnd I don't give a damn if you don't like me\n'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me\n\nAnd I don't give a damn if you don't like me\n'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me\n\nAnd I don't give a damn if you don't like me\n'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me\n\nSecond verse is different than the first.\n\nI'm Jimmy Pop I am\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Alright now boys and girls, we've got another story for you now.\nWe want to introduce to you another friend of the Bible.\n\nHell yeah\nHell yeah\nHell yeah\nHell yeah\n\nIf I were God there would be no explicit sex on T.V.\nLike little Opie eating pie when he made it with Aunt Bea\n\nIf I were God thou shall not worship false Billy Idols\nAnd thou shall add the Book Of Flavor Flav to the Bible\nThou shall make fun of Hindus thou shall not make a speed 2\nIf I were God that's what I'd do heavens no\n\nHell yeah\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Do you still go to raves?\nDo you think that Christ saves?\nDo you spend your days in a Purple Haze?\nDo you contemplate what a grape nut is?\nOr could you live drinkin' your own whiz?\nAre you hooked on a feeling are you hooked on gin-n-tonics?\nAre you hooked on fistin are you hooked on 'Phonics?\nDid you ever have sex with a box of Kleenex?\n\nDid you like the movie Malcolm X?\nOr do you own a record by Stryper?\nDo you have a Mongoloid cousin wearin' diapers?\nWere you born and raised in New Jersey?\nDid you like the taste of Crystal Pepsi?\nAre you deaf?\nWell if you are you can't hear me\nBut what's the use of living if your ear's be\nBroken? Even if I spoke clearly\nYou're still not able to hear me.\n\nCause life is a game that no one wins\nBut you deserve a headstart the way your life's goin'.\nSo throw in the towel cause your life ain't shit;\nNo take that towel and hang yourself with it.\nLife's short and hard like a body-building elf,\nSo save the planet and kill yourself.\nIf you're feeling down-and-out with what your life's all about\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
