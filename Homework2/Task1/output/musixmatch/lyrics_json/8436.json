        "I grasp at lifes fading light\nI need you tonight\nI need to be heard\nYour acts speak lowder than words\nIgnored by you all\nI stumble and fall\nI suddenly knew\nMy life meant nothing at all\nIn shreds\nI stare down at the street\nYearning for sleep\nThat blissful escape\nBut when it comes it's always too late\nThe whore in my bed\n...\n\n", 
        "Must have died a thousand times\nI must have died a thousand times\nI must have died a thousand times\nFeeling less than human\nI surmise I'm less than human\nIn Gods' eyes\nTime he's on my side, she said\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't fall! Don't fall!\n\nAlone in a room I've been in once before\nShapes in the hall\nI'm running for the door\nI'm out on the edge\nBut I'm not defeated yet\nI hear my name above everything else\nMark! Mark!\nAbove everything else\nDon't fall!\n\nIt's a freak out\nNothing's familiar\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't know what happened\nBut somebody lost their mind tonight\nNot sure what happened\nBut I don't think I got home tonight\nAnd there's blood on my shirt\n\nThe clap of thunder\nAnd I see my life go flashing by\nThe smell of sulphur\n...\n\n", 
        "I shake my head and shiver\nThey smile\nAnd then stab my back as they shake my hand\nSend out an SOS plea\nCome quickly\nI'm marooned in monkeyland.\nIs there anyone there\nWho understands me\nAnyone at all\n\nI'm idly staring at the sky\nDid anybody hear me sigh\nA million stars are a moving sight\nTo all you out there\nHearing this tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "One cold damp evening\nThe world stood still\nI watched as I held my breath\nA silhouette I thought I knew\nCame through, someone spoke to me\nWhispered in my ear\nThis fantasy's for you\nFantasy's are in this year\nMy whole life flashed, before my eyes\nI thought, what they say is true\nI've shed my skin, and my disguise\nAnd cold on the naked eye\nEmerged from my cocoon\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm gazing at faces\nStaring blankly at me\nI suppose it's just a sign of the times\nThey tell me tomorrow will never arrive\nBut I've seen it end a million times\n\nI lost my direction while dodging the flak\nOh give me a hint or something\nNow they can erase us\nAt the flick of a switch\nHow long will they wait\nNo!\n...\n\n", 
        "Must have died a thousand times\nI must have died a thousand times\nI must have died a thousand times\nFeeling less than human\nI surmise I'm less than human\nIn Gods' eyes\nTime he's on my side, she said\n...\n\n", 
        "White as a cotton cloud\nSilence, sea and sky\nInnocent as the child\nAlways asking why\n\nI can take you there\nI can show you\nI can take you there\nI'll be there gently catching you as you fall\nHearing you when you call\nSmiling as we climb\nOh, smiling crocodilic\n\nAs certainly as the sun\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "Out of tune boys, out of tune boys\nSignposts to the sun\nSingle file boys, single file boys\nSignposts to the sun\nHigh as you can go\nLennon to Munroe\nClaw their way to the stars\nHigh as you can go\nLennon to Munroe\nClawed their way to the stars\nI think they knew.\n...\n\n", 
        "As she parts her greying hair\nVoices on the stair\nWhen she turns there's something there\nLike a nightmare from the past\nTo the sound of splintered glass\nDance the monsters in the mask\nMan of steel\nMan of steel\nYou just stood laughing in the rain\n...\n\n",
