        "Love, love, love, love\nWhat did you do to me?\nThe things I never missed\nAre things I can't resist\n\nLove, love, love, love\nIsn't it plain to see?\nI just had a change of heart\nWhat can it be?\n\nShe's got eyes of blue\nI never cared for eyes of blue\nBut she's got eyes of blue\nAnd that's my weakness now\n\nShe's got dimpled cheeks\nI never cared for dimpled cheeks\nBut she's got dimpled cheeks\nAnd that's my weakness now\n\nOh my, oh me\nI should be good\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Oh, oh, oh, oh\nHey, yeah.\nSome people call them players\nI'm far from terrified\nSome how I'm drawn to danger\nHave been all of my life\nI feel my hearts divided\nI know I'm playing with fire, but I don't know why\nIt's the bad boys are always catching my eyes\nIt's the bad boys are always spinning my mind\nEven though I know they're no good for me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Yesterday you came my way,\nAnd when you smiled at me,\nIn my heart I felt a thrill you see,\nThat it was love at sight and\nI was right to love you as I do.\nStill I never dreamed that you could love me too.\n\nYour eyes of blue, your kisses too,\nI never knew what they could do.\nI can't believe that you're in love with me.\n\nYou're telling ev'ry one I know\nI'm on your mind each place we go\nThey can't believe that you're in love with me.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy\nAnd all the fellows knew,\nShe wouldn't bill and coo:\nEv'ry single night some smart fellow would try\no cuddle up to her, but she would cry:\n\n\"Ma, he's making eyes at me!\nMa he's awful nice to me!\nMa he's almost breaking my heart,\nI'm beside him, Mercy!\nLet his conscience guide him!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
