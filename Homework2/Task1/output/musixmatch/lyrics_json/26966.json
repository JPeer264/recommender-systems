        "Broken teeth, a shattered jaw\nTen to one, behold my God\nWicked sons of heaven's loss\nRaise your own inverted cross\nKing's of earth, iron fist\nServe the sacred you dismissed\nStand before your final day\nChoke on every line you pray\n\nRaise your glass to death\nNot one second left\n\nWake the lifeless, die to fight this\nStand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell\nWake the lifeless, die to fight this\nStand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell\nStorm the Gates of Hell\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
