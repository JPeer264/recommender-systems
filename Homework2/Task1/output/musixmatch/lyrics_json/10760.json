        "Whats it mean to be alone now\nhows it feel to be by yourself\nyou got me, I didn't get you back\nthen you got me, again\n\n(Chorus)\n\nYou got inside through a hole in my defen--ses\nand how you fit I'll never understand\nbut you got into me, and I got into you\nand now, I wanna do it again\n\nHow's it feel to know now\nwhatchu think 'bout that\nyou got me, now we can't go back\nyou'll never get me again\n...\n\n", 
        "Lately I feel so small\nOr maybe it's just that my bed has grown\nI never noticed it before\nBut you were there\nSo how was I to know\n\nThat this single bed\nWas always meant for two\nNot just anyone\nIt was meant for\nMe and you\n\nAnd now you're half-way round the world\nAnd I'm just a day behind\nNothing seems to fill the hole\nThat I have since you left my side\nYou'll always be my little girl\nThough I can't hold you tonight\nAnd now your halfway round the world\nAnd I'm just a day behind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She was everything,\nAnd I didn't even notice, when she changed her hair.\nAnd when she talks about her day you know I didn't care.\nBut She was everything\n\nI'll tell you what she said (tell you what she said)\nYou can take your broken promises and hit the door\nShe told me that she couldn't take it anymore\nAnd that's all she said\n\nAnd... She said I'd tumble to the walls when she had gone\n...\n\n", 
        "Everybody knows if you've got the coolest clothes\nYou've got everybody on your side\nAnyone can see if you hang around with me\nYou'll be by yourself on Friday night\n\nIt's hard to understand\nIf you never lose you never learn to want to win\nWhen it all comes down\nAll around you now\nDon't let it bring you down\n\n...\n\n"
