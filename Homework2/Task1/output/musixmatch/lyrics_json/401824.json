        "There are no sides to choose from, just things to hate. And I for one, hate myself today.\nBring me down\nDon't listen to me, if you're not ready, cuz bravery means more then just fighting.\n...\n\n", 
        "Skyscrapers and sunsets, sunrise and statelines.\nI love the way the wind carries away worry, and how all that matters is how much that I get to see.\n...\n\n", 
        "A long road to nowhere, seems like the only way. Sometimes the\nroad less traveled seems just as long. And one day your sky will\nfall, but don't run,\nyou'll find it so much better to tough it out.\n\nStand your ground. Never back down.\n...\n\n", 
        "Ball your fist, kick and scream for what you believe in and don't let yourself down. Its so hard to stand against the odds. I can still feel the friction between us.\n\nI can be anything I want to be.\n...\n\n", 
        "Just tell me tonight will never end, becuase I have wanted this for so long. Time always finds a way to sneak up on you.\n\nTime will stop now. This will all end.\n\nNo matter how hard you hold on, time will escape you. Time will escape us. What may seem like an eternity is only just a moment in time.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "This episode played over, over and again. Your routine gets old and I doubt you're one to change.\n\nI can feel your eyes, burning through me.\nYour eyes of courage. Your eyes of strength.\n...\n\n", 
        "There's snakes among us that I never bothered to find.\nStarry eyed and tongue tied, blurting out and rambling.\n\n\"On and on and on\"\nJust hit repeat\n\"On and on and on\"\nOne more time\n\nThere's snakes among us but who's to blame this time?\nMy own phoenix flight, or to ignite.\nCrashed and burnt out, only to meet in the ashes.\n...\n\n", 
        "Destined\n\nMaking the choice of being here or there,\nIs the hardest thing I've had to do.\n\nIt's not as clear and concise as one would think.\nI'm following my hopes and dreams,\n...\n\n", 
        "Faith Or Forgiveness\n\nThree years, and counting, a long time for any endeavors.\nJust get us away from here\n\nI have something you should know, that this will never end,\nAnd our legs will forever hold these scars.\nThere's something you should know, there's more to this story,\nWe'll never fade, and our arms will forever have these scars.\n...\n\n", 
        "Disintegrator\n\nSome still believe, but others like me, see what's inside.\nA scapegoat for reasons why, and wishes washed away.\nAt times like these, I guess best for us this way.\n\nUpset and forgotten, are your only prayers\n\nKnelt and barely breathing,\nYour battered heart has kept you from screaming out loud.\n...\n\n", 
        "The Brave\n\nThere are no sides to choose from, just things to hate.\nAnd I for one, hate myself today\n\nBring me down.\n\nDon't listen to me, if you're not ready\n...\n\n", 
        "Desert dry and tired, sleeping underneath the stars. Longing for, but still laughing the whole time, that piece that makes you \"home.\"\nSpiral downward. Mesmerized the way down\nDestiny sure had a plan for me. Its nothing new for some of you, a siren's song to get you through.\n...\n\n", 
        "Shiner\n\nPages past and pointed to,\nLost along the way, never knowing infinity.\nAnd only one thing is certain, tragedy.\n\nThe swell and storm, tides rise and wash away remembrance.\nSyphon through the sand, force felt through time. Radiate.\n...\n\n", 
        "Brave the winter weather's storm, \nAs you trudge toward, your perpetual ending.\nShout and shiver, along side\nThe \"too far gones\" and the \"never weres.\"\n\nFighting the war within has never felt so good.\nClawing and kicking for anything.\nFighting the war within has never felt this sweet.\nReaching and grabbing for anyone.\n...\n\n", 
        "Inherent Youth\n\nTonight's my night. Unlike any others.\nI've never felt this alive.\nSo far away is death and decay,\nI won't age a day, it's my time to shine\n\nI'll live for today knowing that tomorrow might never come.\nBut I'm content knowing I've made the most of the days, most just piss away.\n\nMaybe someday I'll be something more.\n...\n\n", 
        "Instrumental\n\nInstrumental\n\n...\n\n", 
        "All the wrath and all the faith\nI have inside is eating me alive\n\nMost tend to put their dreams aside\nTo get them through the day\nBut my eyes are open\nAnd I see the sky\n\nAnd I am infinite\nI continue on\n...\n\n", 
        "But when the spotlight comes, where have the words gone?\nThe fall from grace is paved with your lies.\nStand strong behind your beliefs, if you can even manage to stand at all.\n\nWhat happened to the blood pumping through your veins?\nYou\u2019ve scattered the ashes of an iron faith.\nThe sun fades below the horizon, and you say goodbye to what used to be.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got something here worth fighting for\nGive it all, give it all, give it all\nGive me everything that you've got\nIt's all for one or it's none for all\nYou're giving me the reason to keep coming back again and again\nGive it all, give it all, give it all\nNot a single voice unheard or unspoken\nI'm not passing time, not along for the ride\nYou're the fuel to my fire, now watch me burn\n\nWho needs fame and who needs fortune\nCause I've got guts and I've got glory?\nWe took a shot in the dark and we might have failed\nThis is our one chance\nSo ready to see how things turn out\n\nI might have to bite the bullet again\nResentment, no longer my cross to bear\nBitterness and emptiness are a thing of the past\n...\n\n", 
        "I say fear me and fear death, too. You can't keep me on the ground.\nMade to suffer, but no longer; this is coming to an end.\nIt's time for your reign to stop its constant downpour.\nEndure this drought that you've been bringing on for so long.\nFear me, fear death, fear the life you love.\nThe light will shine for you no longer.\n...\n\n", 
        "Rushing in and out, and in and out of my mind (I'm out of my mind)*\nWe live and obey with some kind of hate.\nDreading the time to come when we've got no time at all.\nI want to take the time to stop and think\nAbout doing this, and what it might mean to be.\nWhen I close my eyes, there's nothing but darkness revealed.\nIt's right there in front of me.\nLooking forward for a taste of things to come.\nI can't see familiar faces on anyone.\nLife is trying to pass me by,\nBut not this time. I am not afraid.\nYou're not getting older; you're just getting old.\n...\n\n", 
        "Let's put an end to this once and for all.\nWe've found strength in numbers.\nAnd when your time runs out, what will you believe?\nI'm in no search for salvation or sanity.\nYour words are bringing me down.\nJust leave me be.\nA sinking ship, escape from these shackles at home.\nNow I'm led to your bleeding heart, and I'm standing alone.\nA song, some psalm about hope and fear.\nSubject to the words of a voice I don't hear.\nConstructing an army of fallen men before my eyes.\nBut I don't want your council, I walk my own line.\n...\n\n", 
        "Days can fade, and lives can slip away.\nAny song can be silenced. It's time that we start this over.\nI know what it's like to fall face down.\nWe've all been there before, with no life in sight.\nWhen it feels like the world just gave up, with no strength to see it through.\n...\n\n", 
        "Searching for something that cannot be found.\nAn end with no means to reach.\nLook to the light that we'll never see.\n...\n\n", 
        "Pride and pity play no part of the process.\nLike allegiance lost in hellfire, I've lost it all.\nTell the maker of my grave that I'm not dead.\nThere's far too many things in life I left unsaid.\nAny face and any place to tell me none of this was in vain.\nI'd live this all again, if you'd do the same.\n\nSo to the shadows I disappear.\nTo stay forever, but I wont end here.\n\nDear God, my world is ending.\n...\n\n"
