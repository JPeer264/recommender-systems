        "I was at the bar with my drinkin team,\nIt was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean.\nWe were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave Y'all\nwhen in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval.\nWe were fallin, stumblin, crawlin\nher come da police, Captain Tom Collins,\nand the rapper said freeze\nhe said \"hands in the air and hand over your keys\"\nnow we did, and that was kinda simple,\nnow here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple.\nI asked my friend 'bout Marguarita,\nhe said Shirley was a virgin an I wouldn't wanna meet her.\nSo I talked to Marguarita, cause yoh, she was flyer.\nI took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver.\nNow Im not one for a speech,\nbut there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all.\n\nTequila\nTe-Te-Te - Tequila\nTequila\n\nHere we go again and Im not fussin,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
