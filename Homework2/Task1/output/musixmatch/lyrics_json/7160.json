        "Little power monger, sleep tonight\nThe city lights up like a dirty dime\nI hope that this letter finds you crying\nIt would feel so good to see you cry\n\nUnder this same lifeless sky, \nHow is it I can find no peace?\nWell, I hope that someday we meet both broken\n...\n\n", 
        "Even if the stars go out on me tonight\nEven if the moon bleeds out its blood for light\nI know i can't take her love\nAs your memory drifts in like a samba\nIt's hard to be true\nI'm still in love with you\nEven if the day no longer meets the night\nEven if the sun burns out my love for life\n...\n\n", 
        "See myself off in my monkey suit each day\nDid I walk a slow fish ladder\nMay of concrete and the bones of people\nTen more minutes till my monkey train pulls in\nWhere the bums all shine like poisoned angels\nSmell of diesel stronger than mine\n\nDon't want to live inside it\nDon't want to waste it dreaming\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh I need some time to make sense of something\nI lost along on the ride\nThought I was fine\nWhen she speaks she's like a mime\nIts hard to read her simple mind\nTurns me inside out in a way I can't define\n\nOh I need somebody who won't see through me\nWas happy living a lie\nThought I was fine\n...\n\n", 
        "Never think to ever look around\nNever see it coming at you\nWith your head in the clouds\n\nLooking like a fool, \nDrinking like a clown, \nWorried you be nobody, \nNot so far from that now\n\nYou don't feel so overcome by happiness\nYou're broke\nDo you think you might scrape your life together just in\nTime to find you've got no piece of mind\nWhen everybody wants a piece of your pretty white ass\n...\n\n", 
        "I feel better, now you're gone\nBathing in the sunlight can\nTake away your whole life still\nThere's something about you\n\nOnce or twice\nEverything was lined up straight\nThere's nothing you could ever trust\nThere's something about you\n\nIn a clear spot\nDid you think that I would call?\n...\n\n", 
        "Who were you when I woke up\nwith a bad dream on my head\nHow you said that made no sense\nAnd you showed me how it was\n\nAll the world broken for me\n\nI could say that I was less\nWhen I never knew your face\nCaught(?) you say I make no sense\n...\n\n", 
        "See myself off in my monkey suit each day\nDid I walk a slow fish ladder\nMay of concrete and the bones of people\nTen more minutes till my monkey train pulls in\nWhere the bums all shine like poisoned angels\nSmell of diesel stronger than mine\n\nDon't want to live inside it\nDon't want to waste it dreaming\n...\n\n", 
        "With a drink in her hand\nShe will stop her car and then\nSeal herself for good in the garage\nShe's never leaving\n\nThere were times to be sure\nIt was so pure you might choke\nBut it's too late in the garage\nThe falling ceiling\n...\n\n", 
        "It could be so easy on you\nYou don't know what it's like to\nWant to cry\n\nAnd i want to be with you so bad\nI feel like i'm dying\nOr i've died\n\nThat time you held me by the hand so slow\nI thought that i was getting close\nWhat did i know?\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell yourself nothing's happened\nYou feel okay when you're asleep\nIt's the same mistake you keep making\nYou wake alone but you're not free\n\nAll you your friends may go\nAnd your luck may go\nBut you never feel as bad as when she goes\n...\n\n", 
        "I was won\nLong before you came around\nYou nailed it in\nI won't deny I felt that hammer pound\n\nIt's not the way it started\nBut that's it goes\nI woke up sick in my shoes and clothes\n\nBegged me to\nRight before your yellow grin\n...\n\n", 
        "She summered every winter through a calendar from paradise\nA cheap dressed up temp-job and a tan by cold florescent light\n'Anticipation' playing from the radio it mocks her life\n'I was here', she scribbled in a restroom to prove she was alive\n\nAll the working girls are fine\nAll the working girls are fine\nAll the working girls\nAll the working girls\n...\n\n", 
        "If so and so was so delightful, \nGo ahead, don't waste your life.\nShe'd it like a change of season.\nLetter sent from where the grass is greener.\n\nHaven't been to sleep much lately.\nWords you never said that grate on me.\nKeep a secret flake of his life, \nCall it happiness.\n\nIt would have been nice to be someone.\nTo have and to hold the only one.\n...\n\n", 
        "Hiding out from the winter sundays\nSleeping past the crack of noon\nKnotted legs and a wet hair tangle\nHow they unravelled far too soon\n\nThere's a box I still can't open\nThere's a name that hurts to say\nI fall in love with the way I'm shaking\nIn the crowd I think I see your face\n\nOur time has passed so quickly\nOur bittersweet hello goodbye\nOur time has passed so quickly\nDo you ever wonder why?\n...\n\n", 
        "Just a look can make me feel it might be worth\nThe trouble just to see the look\nIt kills me I forget\nI don't believe in love and I want to believe\n\nJust a word can make me feel there's nothing worth\nThe trouble just to hear the word\nIt fills me with regret\n...\n\n", 
        "Somebody said you'd got it together\nAs if I'd never been alive\nWeak fireworks eclipsed in the trauma\nAnother year does suicide\nThroat open to the cut of the winter\nIf only just to feel alive\n...\n\n", 
        "Was a time\nWhen i thought i could talk down\nTo all my friends\nIt's a crime\nWhen i think of how the sun\nRevolved around me then\nA big wheel was turning\nA great gap that was burgeoning\n...\n\n", 
        "Please don't leave, would you stay until I'm sleeping\nI wake up tomorrow, still I won't feel alive\nAnd hear the trees brush a green light on the window\nAnd the last collision of your breath on the wall\n\nStare me down and tell me that it's true\nStare me down so I believe in you\nEven then I won't believe in you\n\nPlease don't leave\nWould you stay until I'm sleeping\nWould you stay until I'm sleeping\n\nStare me down and tell me that it's true\nStare me down so I believe in you\nEven then I won't believe in you\n...\n\n", 
        "I was so right, sitting stoned\nLike a jewel eyed baby\nI was so right, never knew\nI could feel so perfect\n\nSo perfect now\nLet the plane slide off the ground\n\nIs it once? Is it twice?\nIs it perfect now?\n\nFive miles high, falling down\nIn a bloody mary\n...\n\n", 
        "Sitting on the top of everything\nSweetly irritate what you can't leave alone\n\nHottest summer in a hundred years\nMolten bulkhead burns your hands while you would sleep\n...\n\n", 
        "I was so right, sitting stoned like a jewel-eyed baby\nI was so right, never knew\nI could feel so perfect, so perfect now\nLet the plane slide off the ground\n\nIs it once? Is it twice?\nIs it perfect now?\n\nFive miles high, falling down in a bloody mary\nI was so right, never knew\nIt would be the perfect last word I spoke\n...\n\n"
