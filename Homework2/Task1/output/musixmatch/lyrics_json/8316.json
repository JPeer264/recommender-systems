        "I'm a False Start on a Jukebox, a broken heart after last call\nIt's lights up, I'm locked in, and now its time to settle up\n\nNo slow emotion anymore\nI know the secret of this town\nFaster Faster you're to the floor\nIt sets you up just to knock you down\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Somebody hold me, hold me down\nSo I don't slip tonight\nPunch the clocks out, Punch the wall still\nSomething is wrong with me\n\nWithout you feels, Like the end of the world\nWithout you feels, Like the end of the world\n\nWhat if somebody had told me, I'd be this unhappy\nWhat if somebody had told me, I'd be this alone\nWhat if somebody had told me, the world means nothing\nI wish somebody had told me, Before you were\ngone gone gone gone\ngone gone gone gone\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got a photo booth picture\nIt reminded me of something you said to me\nIf everything you want is so far out of reach\nIf everything that you want is so far out of reach\nMove a little closer to me\n\nI held my breath as the water rushed in\nI was drowning in the man I thought I'd be\nA castaway but you were there for me\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't let you go\nDon't let the dark\nBe the only place you see me\nI'll try to find you something new\nThat pulls me back to your arms\n\nLittle towns are the way we're living\nLittle white crosses on dangerous curves\nEveryone's just dying to get out\nThey got skills but forgot the nerve\n\nTurns me on when you turn me down\nEverything inside me turned around\nYou've been tried and you've been true\nAnd I know that pulled me through\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell me why I'm here\nIn this empty house\nMy mind won't change\nWill it now\nEverything I thought that I put to rest\n\nEverything wrong always the same\nEverything gone Nothing has Changed\n\nBlue letter over my head\nI still remember every word you said\nHeld my breath so tightly\nI never realized you did till now\n\nThere was paper box underneath her bed\n...\n\n", 
        "My tired eyes are blackened wicks\nRazor tucked under my chin\nQuit quit quitters started quitting\nOne last time\n\nTake me down to the other side\nWhere all the lights are handed out\nMine is empty mine is shattered and powered down\n\nHow she cuts from the inside\n...\n\n", 
        "You had a basement apartment\nWe spent the days in the dark there\nEverything implied and perfect\nWe made up our own secret language\nWith no word for goodbye\n\nA Remington Rand on your birthday\nPages of games we've been playing\nLetters of lost conversations\nYou never think that I'm listening\nAre you listening now?\n\nYou're the center of the scenery\n...\n\n", 
        "I had an awful wakeup dream, everything was just what it seemed\nI had a nightmare soaked in light, everything was cracked from inside\nI've seen the way I go in the end, I shut my eyes to begin\nLittle black cars stretched out In a line\nAll moving backwards in time\n\nThere's no connection\nThere's no emotion\nEveryone pretends it's such a beautiful thing\n\nKilled by a memory\nTell me I don't have to be\nAnother number tacked to a wall cuz\nIt leaves me dislocated\n\nI fell I fall I'm falling still\nSleep speaks in little pink pills\n...\n\n", 
        "Some things are made to be broken\nSome things are made to be kept\nWe're in the space between what's over and what's left\nIf I tried too hard to keep you\nI did it so I could reach you\nI had to re-arrange the only things that worked for me\n...\n\n", 
        "Here beats the black heart of my rancor\nThe speed of life can dull your nerve\nI beat no drum for anything anymore\nMight have more than I deserve\n\nThe golden age of being amused\nHas turned into the modern life and times of being confused\nAnd I feel it too\nWhen I'm alone in my room\nWaiting for that light to blink\nThe little song I miss\n...\n\n", 
        "Words keep falling from my mouth,\ntrying just to slow them down.\nKeep on spilling around,\nsaying \"Why do you hurt me?\"\nAnd if anger is my gift,\nthe only gift I'm fit to bring\nThen put me on your shelf,\nsee the wind turn me.\n\nIf it's the only gift I'm fit to give,\nthen put me on your shelf, I don't want to live\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a tall, a mulatto, boy, I know\nAnd he comes to every party, he stands alone\nIn viewing them the rest, a corner of his glance\nIt gets so clear, he's not judging anyone\n\nThe way his arms float around his cage, he's caged\nCanary sings, silently brings his voice to rage\nThe way they stop and stare, the way they turn their heads\nIt's enough to make him want to run away\nBut he stays, he stands his ground\n...\n\n",

        "Yeah you in your mother's new shoes\nbet you like them as much as her blues\nDon't tell anyone - but I plan to move\nthe first time you look away\nTell me the new apron strings\ntaste to you, yes\nmy pretty young things\nYou tell me that hatred is king\n(It's to the weak and the manor born)\n\nLike a trick that you\u62b3e fallen for,\n...\n\n", 
        "\"Don't go there\" I heard her say\n\"You can't stomach what you're gonna see\"\nIt's down there by the water's edge\nWasted and bloated and waiting for someone else\n\nFunny how these things come about\nWhen you're tied to the teeth and mouth\nThe sound of fury, a shot of pain\nThere was no real reason, no gain\n\nI can't go down to the water's edge\nI didn't do it, I saw who did\nDon't go down to the water's edge\nThey did it once, they can do it again\n\nIt ain't no secret to me\nHow she got there down by the stream\n...\n\n", 
        "Mean Mr. Mustard says he's bored\nof life in The District.\nCan't afford the French Quarter high.\nSays it gets old real quick.\nAnd he pales up next to me\nscrawled on the pavement.\nIt says:\nSon, time is all the luck you need.\n\nAnd if I stay lucky then my tongue will stay tied\nand I won't betray the things that I hide.\nThere's not enough years underneath this belt\nfor me to admit the way that I felt.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I imagine long walks down the road\nThings begin to bloom and the sky explodes\nThe damage is undone, and then I know,\nThis has got to be a dream\nMachines and luxuries don't last\nI took my sleep for granted in the past\nAnd I woke up half dead in an hourglass\nNow does that sound funny?\n\nWait - you're almost there, it's gone\nYou're almost there, it's gone\nYou're almost where what follows you\nDoes not bother you\n\nI have walked the tightrope parts of me\n...\n\n", 
        "I awoke in a sinking Manhattan\nI played in drunken cathedrals\nThere were businessmen in armchairs\nWith namebrands and short hair\nDetonating with evil\nSo I scratched out the eyes of all my past lives\nAnd gathered my crooked flowers\nThe gardener grins as the toothache begins\n...\n\n", 
        "\"Don't go there\" I heard her say\n\"You can't stomach what you're gonna see\"\nIt's down there by the water's edge\nWasted and bloated and waiting for someone else\n\nFunny how these things come about\nWhen you're tied to the teeth and mouth\nThe sound of fury, a shot of pain\nThere was no real reason, no gain\n\nI can't go down to the water's edge\nI didn't do it, I saw who did\nDon't go down to the water's edge\nThey did it once, they can do it again\n\nIt ain't no secret to me\nHow she got there down by the stream\n...\n\n", 
        "She calls me Goliath, and I wear the David mask\nI guess the stones are coming too fast for her now\nYou know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass\nAll the stones that are thrown are building up a wall\n\nI have become cumbersome to this world\nI have become cumbersome to my girl\n\nI'd like to believe we could reconcile the past\nResurrect those bridges with an ancient glance\nBut my old stone face can't seem to bring her down\nShe remembers the bridges, burns them to the ground\n\nI have become cumbersome to this world\n...\n\n", 
        "\"He's a real cannibal,\" she goes\n\"I think I'll call him Roderigo\"\nDress him up in darker clothes, sell him away\nStanding underneath her gun\n\"Sit up straight or I'll hurt you\"\nYou know he's not her only son, just the strongest\n\nTied him down to her tree\nStayed fit to name him what he's going to be\n...\n\n", 
        "I slept through Easter, yesterday\nRight through Christmas, just the same\nThe priest came up to me, all up in arms\nHe said, \"Devil boy, what have you done?\"\n\nHey, devil boy\nWe're going to blow your house in\nHey devil boy, what do you think of that?\n\nFor heaven's sakes\nIt's only been two thousand years\nI can't wait any longer for you\n\nThe Jesuits rolled in their tanks, to my front door\nWhile the Capuchins held in loving, on my front porch\nThe Augustinians kept to themselves, stuck their tongues out in a row\n...\n\n",
