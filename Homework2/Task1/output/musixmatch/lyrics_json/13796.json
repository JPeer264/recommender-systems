        "I once met a man who trained himself not to dream\nWhat he seems to have seen was a glimpse of everything\nHe's been painting pictures on canvas since age thirteen\nAnd claims he only exists in the mind of a higher being\nAnd I enjoy his work; mostly scenic landscapes\nBut each one is focused on an easel where the man paints himself painting himself\nAnd all that's in his visual field\nHe said this was the only way he could make himself real\nEver since he could remember, he had one nightmare reoccur\nBut until about ten years ago, it didn't matter\nIt consisted of loud, distorted sounds echoing off the concrete\nHe ran on top of it in attempt to reach a ladder\nNow sometimes, he'd get so close but never touch his destination\nWhich caused him much frustration 'cause he didn't know what it meant\nAnd by the end of the dream, he saw the scene from a bird's eye\nOnly to witness his dead body laying on the cement\n\nIt was only to witness his dead body laying on the cement\nAt first it freaked him out, but after a while he grew content\nSo he thought, \"It's just a dream,\" and kept living his life\nWriting his soul on the canvas 'cause it sheds his planet light\nAnd it goes on and on like space and time, ain't nothing odd\nIt's not that he didn't believe, he just didn't approve of God\nHis experience was one I couldn't comprehend\n'Till I stopped being detective and listened to him as a friend\nHe said\n\n[Chorus]\nHe once saw a painting that told his whole life story\nIt was then that he knew he was the art of divinity\nHe once saw a painting that told his whole life story\nA brush stroke of the gods made him one note in their symphony\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "[Chorus x 2]\nRain\nEveryone wants to get out of the rain\nWants to be free, wants to see no more pan\nWe're guaranteed that the season will change\n'Till then, I'm keeping sunshine on my brain\nWhen the drops hit my head they leave a stain\nEveryone wants to get out of the rain\nWe cannot avoid nature's bleeding vein\nBut I smile while it trickles down the rain\n\nHarvested love only comes after rain\nEven though it brings overwhelming strain\nIt falls from all skies so I can't complain\nWithout it, our growth would not be the same\nMost people like to have someone to blame\nBut it falls randomly, not taking aim\nIt makes up one half of the yin and yang\nWithout the water, you can't have the flame\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Sometimes gunfire's brighter than the sunshine\nSometimes a child's scream influences every dream\nSometimes we fool ourselves into thinkin' we've moved on\nBut no way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen\n\nNo way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen\nNo way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen\nNo way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen\nNo way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen\n\nIt's now twenty-five years later, he's on the brink of fourty-three\nStill searchin' for sanity, surveyin' the floor of his distorted sea\nHe remembers high-school friends jokin' about the war\nNever knew what Mom was cryin' for\n\nThe other piece that shines in his mind\nIs the divine first-love soul-mate beauty brown-eyed queen he left behind\nHe remembers holdin' her tight, watchin' the sunset at shore\nNever knew what she was cryin' for\n\nHe got the letter in his mail by the middle of his summer\nWouldn't have had to go if it wasn't for his new born brother\nHe was barely eighteen, murdering people even younger\nAnd he still ducks and covers every time he hears the thunder\n\nHe still hears the screams, smells the flesh, tastes the death\nSees the blood, feels the pain What's to gain?\nNothing's left but the slug that remains in his right path\nThe bullet laughs every time he cries, and it drives him mad\n\nTrying to sleep, but the visions give him a cold sweat\nThe war's been over for two decades, but he still hasn't been home yet\nEveryday he wakes and strains to repress his guilt\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "What's your definition of dope?\n'Cause I think our opinions differ\n'Till your own skills develop, be wise and shut the hell up\nI told you man, I'll fold your plans\nYou know you can't be colder than me\nWith a microphone in hand I'll show your fans I own this land\nMy flow's intangible\nExpanding growth that stands and holds hip-hop on a cross\nLickin' shots for the lost vision\nListen: It's imbedded in my genetic code to push the evolution\nClean up the pollution and let the rhetoric grow\nSo your records get sold and with each blow\nYou give, adds tad more gold to eat whole out of your cracked peach bowl\nAs we go without rules, the freedom of independence we breed\nSo we'll eat 'till we're full, keep control and bleed at slow-mo speed, you know?\nI weave and sew my way through this imaginary land of fairies and trolls\nTryin' to bury the scroll\nI carry a load that weighs way more than my area code\nVocabulary unfolds so that you cherish the very story of merit you're told\nYour character's bold, but build a barrier\nSpare your words before you perish\nDon't be careless, apparently to share a paragraph tears your nerves\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "You know the type of girl that walks in front of you and makes your jaw drop?\nShe talks in riddles, and sort of tickles your soft spot\nYou see her in the club. She treats you like a scrub\nShe ain't trippin' off you, she got your whole crew in love\nYour day dreamin' of getting her in the bedroom alone\nStraight feedin', You's beg like a dog for the bone\nAnd she's peepin', and the reason is she knows\nTheres a demon in between your legs with a mind of its own\nNow, you're a weakling, overwhelmed with hormones\nY'all start speakin', she grabs the number to your phone\nAnd next weekend you invite her to your home\nYou weren't even thinking. You got played by a pro\nShe's a big shot. Thick lips, nice legs, green eyes\nTook advantage of a thousand. Only slept with three guys\nAin't a hoe or a groupie. Jane Doe or a Lucy\nHer innocent looks are deceving, so I'm telling you to be wise\nI know she's a cutie, but there's power in that coochie\nUnderneath those booty tight, cutoff, daisy-dooksy Levi's\n\nShe's a big shot. You know your dream girl\nShe knows how to use her looks to take advantage of the world\nShe's a big shot. You thought you could school her\nShe dissed you like you were neutered, and told you to go get a sexual tutor\nShe's a big shot. She wouldn't touch your ruler\nShe's so beutiful. A cute but cruel looter, user and abuser\nShe's a big shot. Your eyes are glued to her behind\nYou know her steeze, but you fall for it every time\n\nNow, what about that popular school kid?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
