        "Waiting for the sun but i know that it'll come\nI feel reborn when you touch my arm\nWhole new view, feel better when i talk to you\nI get scared with what i wear\nAnd even when you yell i still love your belly\nIt's true\nRiding it through the night\nStraight through\n\nIt still feels new when i talk to you\nI feel reborn when the sun gets warm\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
