        "Come, Thou fount of every blessing,\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace.\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing,\nCall for songs of loudest praise.\nTeach me some melodious sonnet,\nSung by flaming tongues above;\nPraise His name, I'm fixed upon it,\nName of God's redeeming love.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "O sacred Head, now wounded,\nWith grief and shame weighed down,\nNow scornfully surrounded\nWith thorns, Thine only crown\nHow pale thou art with anguish,\nwith sore abuse and scorn!\nHow doth Thy visage languish\nwhich once was bright as morn!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul!\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul!\nWhat wondrous love is this,\nThat caused the Lord of bliss,\nTo bear the dreadful curse,\nFor my soul, for my soul,\n...\n\n", 
        "I need Thee every hour,\nMost gracious Lord;\nNo tender voice like Thine,\nCan peace afford.\nI need Thee, O I need Thee,\nEvery hour I need Thee!\nO bless me now, Savior,\nI come to Thee.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "1). \u00a0\u00a0I waited and waited for God\nHe turned and He heard me\nHe lifted me out of the mud\nHis Own Hands They cured me\nThe Lord is my help\nI will not be confounded\u00a0\nSo I have focused my face like a flint\nI'll not be ashamed\nLord I come\n\nCHORUS:\nJust as I am\n...\n\n", 
        "I have seen the golden summer light\nFlicker in the trees,\nIn the orchard where the long grass\nSways in the breeze.\nIn the shade across the fence\nAn old man in a chair\nDreams of the names and faces\nWho've been there.\n\nBut lately I have seen you fading\n...\n\n"
