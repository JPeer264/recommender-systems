        "It doesn't matter if we all die\nambition in the back of a black car\nin a high building there is so much to do\ngoing home time\na story on the radio\nsomething small falls out of your mouth\nand we laugh\na prayer for something better\na prayer\nfor something better\nPlease love me\nmeet my mother\nbut the fear takes hold\ncreeping up the stairs in the dark\nWaiting for the death blow\nwaiting for the death blow\nwaiting for the death blow\nstroking your hair as the patriots are shot\nfighting for freedom on the television\nsharing the world with slaughtered pigs\n...\n\n", 
        "Pulling this watch as faces go\nPulling in a word and done it slow this other time\nI see your face is silent\nOh, we go away and play\nWhat have you done\nTakes a feeling inside us all\nContinue out with just one push in my mouth\nBut you're so close now\nAnd you're so close now\n\nAll I have to do is three short blows\nAll that still is best inside\nThe full when the wall\nAnd you don't even know\n\nAll I Have to Do is Kill Her\nAll I Have to Do is Kill Her\nAll I Have to Do is Kill Her\n\nAnd the other faces here with me\nThe others dressed in summers thing\nIf only one way is to be wonderful\nIf only one way is to the other song\nAnd every time it's you, it's like the blood on the stairs is sent away\nAnd every time we see it's all said before you\nIf only one way is to kill you\n\nYou used to say this fear of drowning\nFear no death by water\nFather walks in at the foot of the bed\n...\n\n", 
        "Golden midnight\nTaking us across the water\nHoly love sing\nWe're falling close in every other\nAs dawn breaks I wonder\nSun's growing old\nOurs is not to wonder\n...\n\n", 
        "Sharp and open\nLeave me alone\nAnd sleeping less every night\nAs the days become heavier and weighted\nWaiting in the cold light\nA noise a scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten\nWith spiders inside them and dust on the lips of a vision of hell\nI laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year\n\nA hundred other words blind me with your purity\nLike an old painted doll in the throes of dance\nI think about tomorrow\nPlease let me sleep as I slip down the window\nFreshly squashed fly\n...\n\n", 
        "Red in the Christmas tree shines\nAnd you lick your sticky lips\nNever mind\nI'll stare\nIn love\n\nYellow such a happy colour\nBut I feel so old\n...\n\n", 
        "I chose an eternity of this\nI chose an eternity of this\nLike falling angels\nLike falling angels\nThe world disappeared\nThe world disappeared\nLaughing into the fire\nLaughing into the fire\nIs it always like this?\nIs it always like this?\nFlesh and blood and the first kiss\nFlesh and blood and the first kiss\nThe first colours\nThe first colours\nThe first kiss\nThe first kiss\n\nWe writhed under a red light\nWe writhed under a red licht\nVoodoo smile\nVoodoo smile\nSiamese twins\nSiamese twins\nA girl at the window looks at me for an hour\nA girl at the window looks at me for an hour\nThen everything falls apart\nThen everything falls apart\nBroken inside me\nBroken inside me\nIt falls apart\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday I got so old\nI felt like I could die\nYesterday I got so old\nIt made me want to cry\n\nGo on, go on\nJust walk away\nGo on, go on\nYour choice is made\n\nGo on, go on\nAnd disappear\nGo on, go on\nAway from here\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I've waited hours for this\nI've made myself so sick\nI wish I'd stayed asleep today\nI never thought this day would end\nI never thought tonight could ever be\nThis close to me\nJust try to see in the dark\nJust try to make it work\nTo feel the fear before you're here\n...\n\n", 
        "A nightmare of you of death in the pool\nWakes me up at quarter to three\nI'm lying on the floor of the night before\nWith a stranger lying next to me\n\nA nightmare of you of death in the pool\nI see no further now than this dream\nThe trembling hands of the trembling man\nHold my mouth to hold in a scream\n\nI try to think to make it slow\nIf only here is where I go\nIf this is real I have to see\n...\n\n", 
        "Heaven give me a sign\nWaiting for the sun to shine\nPleasure fills up my dreams\nAnd I love it like a baby screams\n\nIt's so useless how can you be proud\nWhen you're sinking into the ground\nInto the ground fills up my dreams\nAnd I love it like a baby screams\n...\n\n", 
        "Standing on a beach\nWith a gun in my hand\nStaring at the sea\nStaring at the sand\nStaring down the barrel\nAt the arab on the ground\nSee his open mouth\nBut hear no sound\n\nI'm alive\nI'm dead\nI'm the stranger\nKilling an arab\n\n...\n\n", 
        "10.15 on a Saturday night\nAnd the tap\nDrips under the strip light\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I would say I'm sorry\nIf I thought that it would change your mind\nBut I know that this time\nI have said too much\nBeen too unkind\n\nI try to laugh about it\nCover it all up with lies\nI try and laugh about it\nHiding the tears in my eyes\nBecause boys don't cry\nBoys don't cry\n\nI would break down at your feet\nAnd beg forgiveness\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't say what you mean\nYou might spoil your face\nIf you walk in the crowd\nYou won't leave any trace\nIt's always the same\nYou're jumping someone else's train\n\nIt won't take you long\nTo learn the new smile\nYou'll have to adapt\nOr you'll be out of style\n...\n\n", 
        "Come closer and see\nSee into the trees\nFind the girl\nWhile you can\nCome closer and see\nSee into the dark\nJust follow your eyes\nJust follow your eyes\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's not a case of doing\nWhat's right\nIt's just the way I feel that matters\nTell me I'm wrong\nI don't really care\nIt's not a case of share and share alike\nI take what I require\nI don't understand ...\nYou say it's not fair\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The innocence of sleeping children\nDressed in white\nAnd slowly dreaming\nStops all time\nSlow my steps and start to blur\nSo many years have filled my heart\nI never thought I'd say those words\nThe further we go\nAnd older we grow\nThe more we know ...\nThe less we show ...\n\nThe very first time I saw your face\nI thought of a song\n...\n\n", 
        "Whisper your name\nIn an empty room\nYou brush past my skin\nAs soft as fur\nTaking hold\nI taste your scent\nDistant noises\nOther voices\n\nPounding in my broken head\n...\n\n", 
        "All the faces\nAll the voices blur\nChange to one face\nChange to one voice\nPrepare yourself for bed\nThe light seems bright\nAnd glares on white walls\nAll the sounds of charlotte sometimes\nInto the night\nWith charlotte sometimes\nNight after night she lay alone in bed\nHer eyes so open to the dark\nThe streets all looked so strange\nThey seemed so far away\nBut charlotte sometimes did not cry\nThe people seemed so close\nPlaying expressionless games\nThe people seemed so close\nSo close\nSo many\nOther names\n...\n\n", 
        "Creatures kissing in the rain\nShapeless in the dark again\nIn the hanging garden please don't speak\nIn the hanging garden no one sleeps\n\nIn the hanging garden\nIn the hanging garden\n\nCatching haloes on the moon\nGives my hands the shapes of angels\nIn the heat of the night the animals scream\nIn the heat of the night walking into a dream\n\nFall, fall, fall, fall\nInto the walls\n...\n\n", 
        "On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes\nSoftly through the shadow of the evenin' sun\nStealin' past the windows of the blissfully dead\nLooking for the victim shivering in bed\nSearchin' out fear in the gathering gloom\nAnd suddenly a movement in the corner of the room\nAnd there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright\nThat the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't care if Monday's blue\nTuesday's gray and Wednesday too\nThursday I don't care about you\nIt's Friday I'm in love\nMonday you can fall apart\nTuesday, Wednesday break my heart\nOh, Thursday doesn't even start\nIt's Friday I'm in love\nSaturday wait\nSunday always comes too late\nBut Friday never hesitate\nI don't care if Monday's black\nTuesday, Wednesday heart attack\nThursday never looking back\n...\n\n", 
        "'Everyone feels good in the room,' she swings\n'Two chord cool in the head,' she sings\n'A-buzz a-buzz a-buzzing like them killer bees...'\nTell me this is not for real\nPlease simply this is not for real...\n\nFrom time to time her eyes get wide\nAnd she's always got them stuck on me\nI'm surprised at how hot honey-colored and hungry she looks\nAnd I have to turn away to keep from bursting\nYeah I feel that good\n\nShe slips from the stage\nA foot no more\nBut it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor\nAnd the two chord cool still grooves\n...\n\n", 
        "I've waited hours for this\nI've made myself so sick\nI wish I'd stayed asleep today\nI never thought this day would end\nI never thought tonight could ever be\nThis close to me\nJust try to see in the dark\nJust try to make it work\nTo feel the fear before you're here\n...\n\n",
