        "Brother won't you look at the sky\nThere's something burning so bright\nAnd what it is I can't see\nBut I think it's coming at me.\nDid you get here in a rocket\nAnd did you journey through space?\nDid your mother never scold you\nOh when she looked at your face?\nDo you know where you come from?\nBecause you look out of place\nIn a town where only the rain comes down\nYou fell down to earth\n...\n\n", 
        "The girl comes from Lakeville \nHer dad - he cuts hair. \nIt's a small town in the middle of nowhere. \nIn tried and tested fashion \nShe took a plane and headed west \nTo a city of neuroses, to the one that I love best. \n\nDid you think I couldn't feel it from 5000 miles away? \nThat I wouldn't sense betrayal in the things he could \nnot say? \nI may be ditsy - I know I'm uncool \nBut I'm not like you. \n\nSierra Bonita \nThat you'll never be. \nAnd I figure for that you'll always hate me. \n...\n\n", 
        "Oh the lights here are beautiful \nStrung like chandeliers in the rain \nBut, in the face of my past misdemeanours \nI can't go there again... \n\nSo come on and save me from the height of bad \nbehaviour \nI've got a taste for the misadventurous kind \nSo in the light of it, in spite of it all \nI want your 57 flavours \n...\n\n", 
        "Well it could have been a Sunday\nOr it could have been the next day\nOr it could have been any day at all\nAnd it could have been a good day\nOr a very very bad day\nWhen you made your grand arrival, I can recall\n\nBut if I know you\nYou'll come sailing through the starlight in the blue\nAnd if I know you\n...\n\n", 
        "Been good, been bad, got worse, got better\nI feel I know myself when I'm looking in the mirror\nBeen hurt, been loved - I'm scarred, I'm not bitter\nI'm an angel with knowledge of a sinner\nBut what do I do and how should I be?\nWhen I look at myself I can only be me\n\nI need a little patience...\n\nBeen hard, been soft, been both, been neither\n...\n\n", 
        "Guess it's true -\nI only ever wanted to be with you.\nAnd now I find i've lost my way to go...\nI always mess it up\nYou should have known i'm not reliable.\nAnd now, when i'm tired,\nI can't get to sleep.\nOh, My thoughts won't desert me\nAnd I cannot dream.\nThe colours haved changed, only grey in my life\nNow my sense of belonging has gone with my smile...\n\nBut I know someday soon\nI will get home\nI know someday soon\nI won't be alone\nI know someday soon\nI will get home\nAnd I know someday soon\nI won't be alone\n\nIs this my life?\n...\n\n", 
        "And my confession would have you on the floor\n- if you knew the truth\nBut that's the way they want you -\nEveryone's a sucker for the haze of youth\nWe're all prairie children, brought up on the lies of the past\nSo it's no surprise then - you will have to ask...\n\nWatch out Billie 'fore you go to fast\nYou say it couldn't hurt, but then it couldn't last\nYou get fifteen minutes while they're watching you\n...\n\n", 
        "Love is the one thing to rely on\nAnd as long as we all have today, we'll be okay.\n\nSix o'clock, so you feed the kids\nAnd you pack them off to school\nTake a drive through your secret life\nIt's a mystery to you.\nIt's not the way you thought that it would be...\n\nBut love is the stuff that we depend on\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't know where I go wrong -\nEverything I do just takes so long.\nI don't know what's up with me\nI'm swinging from a branch of my family tree...\nSo give me some of yours then, if you think it might get better\nIf you're sure you've got the answer, you know i'm going to let you...\n\nOh, you know it, you're shining like the rainbow\nAnd the birds and bees all know your name\nI could be black, I could be blue, I could be anything for you\nIf you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow.\n\nI don't want your sympathy -\n...\n\n", 
        "Brother won't you look at the sky\nThere's something burning so bright\nAnd what it is I can't see\nBut I think it's coming at me.\nDid you get here in a rocket\nAnd did you journey through space?\nDid your mother never scold you\nOh when she looked at your face?\nDo you know where you come from?\nBecause you look out of place\nIn a town where only the rain comes down\nYou fell down to earth\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh good Lord above, I'm immune to the love of a good man\nI go for the suckers, those mean motherfuckers I can't resist.\nIf I should get bitten. As long as he's smitten I understand\nThat pain comes with pleasure, such bittersweet treasure cannot be missed.\n\nSo how can you help me now?\nI can't help myself...\n\nI go on and jump, give it a try\nChecking the parachute, see if it flies.\nOh I don't care if I should fall I never bruise...\nI go on and just, give it a try\nDon't call the ambulance, I'm still alive\n...\n\n", 
        "Very good sir, getting better\nCould be amazing if you'd try\nSuch a sweet boy, very Catholic\nEyes so beautifully wide\n\nBut I'm just a bloodhound really\nHunting with the pack - I do it well\nI only chase to pass the time\nI have been desperately wondering\nIf you want me lately\nI only need to see a sign\nC'mon and show me now...\n\nVery good sir, getting better\n...\n\n", 
        "Dear Frustrated Superstar, your mother's waiting in the car\nTo whisk you off to your new premiere\nAnd all the friends who knew your name\nAre waiting, wondering what became\nOf the girl that they once knew but never loved\nThey never loved.\n\nSo every city tells the lie\nOf beggars, tramps and butterflies\nOf all these things, then what am I?\nA princess in a threadbare gown,\nA gaudy, painted circus clown?\nA child who lost her key and can't get home?\n\nAll the things I never was -\nA traitor in the Western Wars\nA girl who did it just because.\nDo or die, or don't at all\n\nPrepare to suffer for your call\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got a quarter in my pocket of an apple left to eat:\nIt's a wonder that I'm standing on my own two feet.\nIn the shadow of a thousand veiled Victorian goodbyes\nJewels of litter come to greet me, and it stings my eyes.\nOh it burns like a fire and it pulls me through-\nWe are parted by desire for the strange and new.\nI've got a quarter in my pocket, I'm advancing to the booth,\nI am picking up and praying that I talk to you.\n\nAnd now, I'm halfway home, I'm at the corner of our street,\nWould you like to come and meet me?\nNow that I am halfway home\nMan, I never felt so lonely-\nI long for you to hold me now I'm home.\n...\n\n", 
        "Years ago, you said to me,\n\"I think I'm losing the fight,\nOr the fight's losing me, I'm not certain,\"\nAnd here we are-the closing scenes,\nAnd all the house lights come up,\nOh, the falling of our final curtain...\nI've played a role for so long that I've forgotten myself,\nBut I said I'd be there and I'm keeping my word,\nYou've played yourself so well,\nAnd now I want to be you,\nA great imitation of losing my nerve.\n\nOh, it's over,\nAnd everything is wrong, everything has gone,\nAnd I know that everything means nothing,\nOh, it's over,\nBut I don't want to fight, I don't want to be right,\nI know that everything means nothing,\n...\n\n", 
        "In the back of a car on a road in the dark,\nIn the stillicide, silently falling snow,\nI have packed everything that I own in a bag,\nAnd I'm driving, I'm driving to Idaho,\nA poem for leaving, a reason to go,\nSo I'm driving, I'm driving to Idaho.\n\n'Cause I can't be anyone but me, anyone but me,\nAnd I can't keep dreaming that I'm free, dreaming that I'm free,\nI don't want to fall asleep and watch my life from fifty feet,\nMy hands are on the wheel so I'm driving to Idaho,\n'Cause I hear it's mighty pretty...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, this road is long, this road is wide,\nIt takes more than luck to last the ride,\nIt takes strength and it takes courage to survive,\nAnd did someone ever say to you,\n\"There's nothing bound in thought you cannot do?\"\nWell, I've seen some things but not all of them came true.\n\nSo I don't want to be the last, I don't want to be the first,\nDon't want to be alone with my thoughts tomorrow,\nAnd I don't want to be afraid, don't want to look away,\nI'm learning to breathe,\nNo I don't want to be the last, I don't want to be the first,\nI just need a hope and a light to follow,\nLike sailors look to stars to find their way home,\nI'm learning to breathe on my own.\n...\n\n", 
        "Good days, bad days, I've had a few of those,\nSame old story-I know how this song goes,\nAt least I did, but now I'm not so sure,\nNothing's in it's place, nothing's certain anymore,\nBirds fly, trees sway, why can't I be like that?\nHappy knowing what I am, in fact and leaving be?\nBut truth has been obscured,\nI am only human and I'm always wanting... more.\n\nOh, the world is a place and they say it's on our side,\nBut I wonder, is there comfort in those moments when we die?\nNow I see, Mr. King, this was in the books you gave me,\nWhich I read, disbelieving, thinking poets are depressed,\n...\n\n", 
        "In a race to get out of this place\nI am checking my face in the back of a spoon\nYou're accusing - you say I'm not here\nBut I'm here, yes I'm here, I'm not on the moon\nI'm leaving so soon\n\nDon't presume to know shit about me\n'Cause I don't know myself\nFrom one day to the next\nAnd I don't pose perplexities purposly\n'Cause it isn't a game - it isn't a test\n\nAnd now hey, you\nCould you give it a rest?\nJust take me home, come on\nAnd get me undressed\nPut on the fire\nAnd make it enough -\nOh, we're geeks\nBut we know this is love\n\nNine am to the beat of a drum\nAs we drive through the canyon\nI'm feeling the hum of the engine\n...\n\n", 
        "five o'clock and a fire escape symphony\nspillin' out across the road and the square\nand the sky's the same as your own do you think of me?\ndo the parks and trees and the leaves reach you there\nafter the rain in the lonely hours he haunts me\ncallin' out again and again\n\nSophia, Sophia\ni'm burning, i'm burning\nit's a fire, a fire\ni cannot put out\nSophia, Sophia\ni'm learning that some things\ni can't go without\nand one of them is him\n\nnow i walk these streets like a stranger in my hometown\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey was there something that you wanted to say?\nI don't know what to do when you look that way,\nCigarettes and tequila at 6,\nAnd the sun going down on our life as it is,\nIn the blue light oh, your face, it looks... so... pale,\nIn the blue light, oh I can tell what you're going to say.\n\nBut all good people have a sense of themselves,\nThey never worry, they know what tomorrow will bring,\nAnd all good people the world is ok,\nWhy should we worry, when we can do anything?\n...\n\n", 
        "In a little while\nPeople and place's will\nBe so far behind\nOut of my body\n\nIn a little while\nI will play aces\nAnd raise my glass\nIn a note of defiance\n\nBut untill then\nI scream untill I'm hollow\nI carve it in my skin\nSave it for tomorrow\n\nI'm gonna bang my drums\nI'm gonna make it come, yeah\nI'm gonna bring it on, now\nIt's a heart attack\nA heart attack,\nI'm bringing it,\nBring it back,\nI'm bringing it back\nTo me\n...\n\n"
