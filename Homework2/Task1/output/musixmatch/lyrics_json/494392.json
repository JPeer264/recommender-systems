Never saw the impact\nCan he see their life?\nFall before his eyes\n\nHell no\nJustify this pain\nDrained and dropped, now it's all over\nIn his eyes a dead man's gaze on fire\n\nThis life so great\nWho ever knew it could end so fast\nBut surely there's another way?\nThis building rage, I feel it's going to explode\n\nNow time rolls by\nThe cracks emerge, breaking down another moment\nNow, one more time\nIn this life no one ever wanted this\n\nI know I will find you someday\nTake you from this world\nYou will always fear and\n...\n\n", 
        "Come all you fiends and swine\nAnother life passes by this time\nClaim redemption in a new religion\nCrossing over to the other side\n\nWhat's your halo doing in this dirt field?\nYou're waiting for something\nPraying it's alright\n\nI'm praying for everything in this life\nPieces of me, you're taking away\nWhatever I say, whatever I do\nMy life is falling away\n\nSystems crashing\nEternal misery if you like\nI wanted far more\n\nFor ever and now\nYou pray for me\nI'll pray for you\nI choose not to hide, but to be a man\nDon't jeopardise future lives for cheap values\nPray for me, I'll pray for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Who'll give you a picture of your life?\nSupplying the rage to burn\nFragments of nothing, no meaning, no light\nLock it tighter in your mind\n\nYou'll systematically process more lies\nDrown the life deep in your mind\nThey die staring at you\nIndifferent to what you're screaming about\n\nI have no answers this time\nSo many times I'll watch you fall\nI'll see it one more time\nGiving up on you is closing the door\n\nYou'll drop this time\nOn the tight rope of life, you're walking blind\nFall back, last breath\nMeet the man, it's time to shine\n\nWho'll give you a picture of your life?\nEternal rage to burn\nYou've got nothing, no meaning, no light\nTwisted, locked inside your mind\n\nYour calculating resides this time\n...\n\n",

        "As this day unfolds I'll cease to exist\nI'm losing control and you, you're turning away\nHow can you explain that I'll mean more to you when I'm missed?\nI'm bleeding in pain as you leave me to go through this\n\nFalling away, the connection torn\nMisplaced existance, I'm alone\nEverything is set to end today\nFading away, the damage is done\n...\n\n", 
        "Glimpse into a new life\nCut through darkest nights\nGuardian of truths\nIt's my keeper\n\nLike the flames of a dying star\nMy memories are fading\nUnderstanding who you are\nI live for no one\n\nDesire and determination\nHartfelt desparation\nIt's time to wake up from your lies\n\nNow you're breathing new life\nThrough clarity of mind\nWalk without fear\nI can stand alone\n...\n\n", 
        "Changing minds like the wind\nI'm forever blaming you\nThat time dissolves to emptiness\nIt's spiraling inwards\nThe windows into the unknown\nCaptures this moment\nSometimes we find that we want to see\nThis is our story\n\nYes I give my life to you\nA memory in waiting\nCataclysmic clash of the gods\nThis is the war of ages\n...\n\n", 
        "It's as though we can't believe\nThat our earth will ever come to an end\nAnd with our insatiable taste for failure\nRegeneration never a chance to begin\n\nIntellect surrendered to desire and greed\nHumanity has become earth's disease\nWith only everything to regret now\nAs this world comes crashing down\n\nDown, as we shut our eyes and turn away\nDrowning deep in this slow state of decay\nBlinded and conceited, self justified\nAs another earth bleeds and dies\n\nAnd still we can not believe\nThat our earth is bleeding to an end\n...\n\n",

        "Look into your past, what can you see?\nLack of reprisal\nWalked upon as though you don't exist\nCall out to no one\n\nLight shines through, transparent as my pain\nDarkness in my eyes\nSoulless, fragile, broken mortal frame\nThe ending of life\n\nReach inside to find that place of real\nTake me from hell to freedom\nTranscend the pool of broken dreams\nWalking from the shadows\n\nBreak me, hate you\nWhat do you find when you turn this stone?\nLike me, I'm like you\nDoes this make you a better man?\n...\n\n", 
        "Suspended deep within the cognition storm\nA shattered perception of existence evermore\nThe depression born futillity burning inside\nFuels the vortex of this mental suicide\nIngesting the darkness as we're facing the end\nAn injected sequence of systematic descent\nDistorting evolution of the eternal machine\nAs we turn the page towards our blank infinity\n\nSubjugated, cyber archetypes the new divinity\nMutilated, dark mutations of biotechnology\nDesecrated, remnants of the final resistance\nAnnihilated, the failed human subsistence\n\nCorroding the existence of this cybernetic mind\nThe disconnected genetics sci-cloning inside\nProcessing this state of dimensional symmetry\nA million light years inside a cold magnetic dream\n...\n\n", 
        "I take these hands\nAnd place them round your throat\nMortality near straight away\n\nAnd still I run from this fucking pain\nInfected, this curse unknown\nChanging, distorted, deranged within\nThe degeneration ends\n\nAfter this sense of reality\nThe question begs, why was I chosen?\nPowerless in this fight for immunity\nAgainst this genetic sequence distortion\n\nWe're all the same and this is not a game\nThe ones you loved left alone, unchanged\nTake the strength and burn it away\nPull it apart and start again\nNever again I'll feel this pain\nHauled down to hell, more of the same\nMore of the same\n...\n\n", 
        "Traces of life dispersed through eternity\nThe onslaught of evolution\nRemnants of worlds floating in darkness\nThis is all our Universum\n\nMeridian lines through space and time\nContinuum, bring forth a solution\nA small cog in the grand design\nSpin us a new revolution\n\nIt is certain\n\nDid we exist before time?\nIs this our final dejection?\nA dissipating point of aggression\nIndifferent toward our perception\n\nCan you hear them through the pain\nAll but one are calling\nThey see you losing your own way\n...\n\n", 
        "Enslaved to fear inside\nTrapped in this life\nThe closing walls of time\nTainted transparency\nA faltered mind of travesty\n\nI walk the path with none by my side\nI've failed to grasp the light\n\nTears flow from the eyes of pain\nThis vortex pulls me down\n\nLeft bleeding and trapped inside\nA dark reminder of the sin I live\nFalling, I've had too many chances\nThe judgement is called, now and I am sinking\n\nTake me away\nThis fate, forever cursed\n...\n\n", 
        "Plagued by senseless tragedy\nAll consuming pain\nIn the eyes of the other man\nKilling is today\n\nJust expect to walk away\nI thought he would never be named\nDescending on the very mistake\nDecisions of fate, is mine for the taking\n\nMy delusions surround me\nNo longer a senseless dream\nAre these the threads of my sanity?\nIt's a side of my emptiness\nBlackened thoughts so far\n...\n\n", 
        "You and I, one and the same\nThese eyes so drained\nWe march as one, numb beings\nSlaves to the new order\n\nThe higher echelon pre-determined\nAn unbreakable cycle\nA deliberate step into thankless ranks\n\nThe certainty of our future\nMay fire you into greatness\nKneel now and etch your name\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Cold and disillusioned with you\nWhat do you offer?\nPain, self defeat, blacken my view\nSo be it, I'll take another\n\nDefiance in all who brought me down\nDenied oneself from life\nConside in no one else for the fear of truth\nTorn from fragmented youth\n\n[Lead: Michael Soininen]\n\nPush me beyond cerebral limits\nPotential's there for the taking\nDrifting through these blackened skies\nSet forth upon my awakening\n\nI hear you in the wind\nLead me to my saviour\n...\n\n", 
        "Torn between frayed realities\nShattered forms of oblivion\nDeprived of light and sanity\nWeakened by this fear and pain\n\nA negated call to reincarnate\nFrom failure to find the light within\nSkewed waves of thought located\nIn this dimensional asymmetry\n\nDelusions filter the light\n...\n\n", 
        "Can you hear demons crawl?\nThey're feeding on our flesh\nA bite into the depths\nWe proudly wear the scars\nUnrest again\nLost in a maze of thrashed nerves\nAnd now unashamed, we've changed forever\nWe are the haters\n\nSo we've lost our way, now we will lose it all\nWho is left standing when the black death rolls in?\n\nDevour us all\nA seascape of bones decayed\nNone will stand here as the black death rolls in\n\nWe push to reach our limits\nAnd face the impossible rain\nPushing deep into the abyss\nTowards our final decay...\n...\n\n", 
        "Wade through the pain\nStill burns the same\nTiresome, so mundane\nTake me away\nWash out the rage\nShattered and so alone\n\nGlass like figures stare through the sphered windows\nPassing with the light they they hold\nThat they hold on\n\nFlames blaze through the darkness that follows in\n...\n\n"
