        "She\nMay be the face I can't forget.\nA trace of pleasure or regret\nMay be my treasure or the price I have to pay.\nShe may be the song that summer sings.\nMay be the chill that autumn brings.\nMay be a hundred different things\nWithin the measure of a day.\n\nShe\nMay be the beauty or the beast.\nMay be the famine or the feast.\n...\n\n", 
        "Darling, there is one thing I must tell you, you must know\nIt's so hard to say the words I feel\nThis fancy that I'm on's been going on too long\nIt's time to stop pretending things are real\n\n'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind\nAnd I just don't know what's right or wrong\nTo take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do\n...\n\n", 
        "You push me when I'm falling\nAnd then you put me down\nI guess I missed my calling\nI should have been a clown\n\nHow much more\nHow much more can I stand\nYou're pouring water\nOn a drowning man\n\nYou put me on the right track\nAnd then you put me down\nYou stab me in the back\nEverytime I turn around\n\nCriticize my lovin'\nWhen I'm doing the very best I can\nYou're pouring water\nOn a drowning man\nYou're pouring water\n...\n\n", 
        "She\nMay be the face I can't forget.\nA trace of pleasure or regret\nMay be my treasure or the price I have to pay.\nShe may be the song that summer sings.\nMay be the chill that autumn brings.\nMay be a hundred different things\nWithin the measure of a day.\n\nShe\nMay be the beauty or the beast.\nMay be the famine or the feast.\n...\n\n"
