        "I should know who I am by now,\nI walk, the record stands somehow\nThinking of winter\nYour name is the splinter inside me while I wait\n\nI remember the sound\nOf your November downtown\nAnd I remember the truth\nA warm December with you\nBut I don't have to make this mistake\nAnd I don't have to stay this way\nIf only I would wait\n...\n\n", 
        "Girlfriend in a coma, I know, I know, it's serious,\nGirlfriend in a coma, I know, I know, it's really serious.\nThere were times when I could have murdered her,\nBut you know I would hate anything to happen to her,\nNo I don't want to see her.\n\nDo you really think she'll pull through?\nDo you really think she'll pull through?\n...\n\n", 
        "My eye's reflection,\nA window's perfection,\nLook and you'll see,\nThe things I can be,\n\nThe graves have passed,\nThe moments don't last,\nLike your gods of old days,\nThat don't see my way,\nWhat I want today:\n\nDon't look away,\nIf you do, then I may,\nNo one knows the truth, not even you,\nYou let your mind show,\nA hate that I've known,\nI've been there before,\nDon't look away anymore,\n\nYour stare is like a spot on the sun,\nI'm blind but the only one,\nWho knows what to say to you,\n...\n\n", 
        "Shoelaces untied\nYou can dry your eyes\nPerfect shadows lie\nBehind us\nThis is the day I make you mine\n\nThe way your hair lies\nSometimes unrecognized\nAll the way from Nice today\nOn a train\nNothing to say but there's still time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm leaving but don't worry I'll be back again,\nyou're always right here\nand you're grieving but don't hurry to your pack of friends,\nI'll stay it's clear,\n\nThe one you knew from your love\nI grew into complete and whole\nand the way I justify,\nit's my way to control love everlasting\n...\n\n", 
        "You're sitting in your chair\nNo ones around\nYour lights are turned down low\nAnd your skin feels about to tear\nAnd you is no sound\nAnd all I am is frightened for you now\n'Cause you run and\nHow can I show you that you're done\n\nYou're on your knees\nPicking up the pieces from your past\nBut there's nothing more to gather\nHolding on to moments that won't last\nOr would you rather end it all\n...\n\n", 
        "So, we're alone again \ni wish it were over \nwe seem to never end \nonly get closer \nto the point where i can take no more \n\nThe clouds in your eyes \ndown your face they pour \nwon't you be the new one burn to shine \ni take the blue ones every time \nwalk me down your broken line \nall you have to do is cry \n...\n\n", 
        "I can't get to bed\nBut I'm really tired\nThe things in my head\nYou used to admire\nIn your sundrenched world\nIt couldn't be worse\nDon't bother asking\nHere comes the nerves\nWhile I'm trying to bask\nIn your sundrenched world\n\nI'm talking to you\nBut you're not listening\nI don't know what to do\nMy heart is blistering\nWriting this song\nTell me I'm not wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "Way down, in New York town\nThinking about the way she loved me\nThere's a hole in my pocket\nThat's about her size\nBut I think everything\nIs gonna be alright\nYes I hope everything\nIs gonna be alright\n\nThe smiling face, straight in LA\nThe gifts are found at the bar\nBut I wish my car\n...\n\n", 
        "You're Sylvia Plath\nAs you drift from the bath\nI hand you a robe\nAnd so it goes\nThe moment'll pass\n\nYou're Simone de Beauvoir\nAs you get out the car\nThe way you read me\nNo one can see me\nIs who you are\nAnd these photographs keep me alive\n\nBabe, here's your song\nBabe, it took too long\n...\n\n", 
        "So, we're alone again \ni wish it were over \nwe seem to never end \nonly get closer \nto the point where i can take no more \n\nThe clouds in your eyes \ndown your face they pour \nwon't you be the new one burn to shine \ni take the blue ones every time \nwalk me down your broken line \nall you have to do is cry \n...\n\n",

But you stayed on the other side on the line in this place and you can not look at me, you are blind And this you can fake No, this you can fake it. And sometimes, sometimes I wanna be ...", 
        "What if you could wish me away?\nWhat if you spoke those words today?\n\nI wonder if you'd miss me when I'm gone\nIt's come to this, release me\nI'll leave before the dawn\n\nBut for tonight I'll stay here with you\nYes for tonight I'll lay here with you\n\nBut when the sun hits your eyes\nThrough your window\nThere'll be nothing you can do\n...\n\n"
