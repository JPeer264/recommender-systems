        "Curled around you babe,\nYou're lost in your head,\nI get lost in your word.\nYou feel far too deep,\nIt keeps you from sleep,\nAnd I know that it hurts.\n\nTell me everything that you lost,\nShow me every home you left behind,\nPoint out all the ones that you loved,\nI've got time.\n\nPlease don't be sad,\n...\n\n", 
        "Today I realized as I went walking\nHurried past the dark, far away from where I live\nYou are all I know, understand now.\nI'm fearful of the night and the things I cannot see\nI can't lose tonight, just watch me fall in line, for you\n\nWhat are we going to do?\nWhen all we said was true?\nBut if feels like fading out\n...\n\n"
