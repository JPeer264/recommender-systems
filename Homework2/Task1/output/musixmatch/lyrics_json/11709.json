        "Is there love, tonight\nWhen everyone's dreaming\nOf a better life\nIn this world\nDivided by fear\nWe've got to believe that\nThere's a reason we're here\nYeah, there's a reason we're here...\n\nOh, yeah...\n\nCause these are the days worth living\nThese are the years we're given\nAnd these are the moments\nThese are the times\nLet's make the best out of our lives...\n\nSee the truth, all around\nOur faith can be broken\nOur hands can be bound\n...\n\n", 
        "I am a vision, I am justice\nNever thought that I could love\nLiving in shadows, faded existence\nIt was never good enough\nWithin the darkness, you are the light\nThat shines away\nYou're trapped in violence, I can be the man\nWho saves the day\n\nI'm there for you\nNo matter what\nI'm there for you\nNever giving up\nI'm there for you\n\nFor you\n...\n\n", 
        "London calling to the faraway towns\nNow that war is declared-and battle come down\nLondon calling to the underworld\nCome out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls\nLondon calling, now don't look at us\nAll that phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust\nLondon calling, see we ain't got no swing\n'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing\n\n(Chorus)\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been thinking about you, my love\nAnd all the crazy things that you put me through\nNow I'm coming around, Throwing it back to you\nWere you thinking of me when you kissed him\nCould you taste me when you licked his skin\nAll the while I showered you with trust and promises\nWhat I'm needing now is some sweet revenge\nTo get back all that I lost then\nI gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you\n\n(Chorus:)\n...\n\n", 
        "I've been thinking about you, my love\nAnd all the crazy things that you put me through\nNow I'm coming around, Throwing it back to you\nWere you thinking of me when you kissed him\nCould you taste me when you licked his skin\nAll the while I showered you with trust and promises\nWhat I'm needing now is some sweet revenge\nTo get back all that I lost then\nI gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you\n\n(Chorus:)\n...\n\n", 
        "So lately, been wondering\n\nWho will be there to take my place?\n\nWhen I'm gone, you'll need love\nTo light the shadows on your face\nIf a great wave shall fall\nAnd fall upon us all\nThen between the sand and stone\nCould you make it on your own?\nIf I could, then I would\n\nI'll go wherever you will go\nWay up high or down low\nI'll go wherever you will go\nAnd maybe, I'll find out\n...\n\n", 
        "Is it getting better?\nOr do you feel the same?\nWill it make it easier on you now?\nYou got someone to blame\n\nYou say one love, one life\nIt's one need in the night\nOne love, we get to share it\nLeaves you, darling, if you don't care for it\n\nDid I disappoint you?\nOr leave a bad taste in your mouth?\nYou act like you never had love\nAnd you want me to go without\n\n...\n\n"
