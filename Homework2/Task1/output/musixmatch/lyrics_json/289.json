        "You're cynical and beautiful\nYou always make a scene\nYou're monochrome delirious\nYou're nothing that you seem\nI'm drowning in your vanity\nYour laugh is a disease\nYou're dirty and you're sweet\nYou know you're everything to me\n\nEverything you are\nFalls from the sky like a star\nEverything you are\n...\n\n", 
        "Could you whisper in my ear\nThe things you wanna feel\nI'd give you anything\nTo feel it coming\nDo you wake up on your own\nAnd wonder where you are?\nYou live with all your faults\n\nI wanna wake up where you are\nI won't say anything at all\nSo why don't you slide\n\nYeah, I'm gonna let it slide\n\nDon't you love the life you killed?\nThe priest is on the phone\nYour father hit the wall\nYour ma disowned you\nDon't supposed I'll ever know\nWhat it means to be a man\nIt's something I can't change\nI'll live around it\n...\n\n", 
        "Broadway is dark tonight\nA little bit weaker\nThan you used to be\nBroadway is dark tonight\n\nSee the young man sittin'\nIn the old man\u2019s bar\nWaitin' for his turn to die\n\nThe cowboy kills the rock star\nAnd Friday night\u2019s gone too far\nThe dim light hides the years\nOn all the faded girls\n\nForgotten but not gone\nYou drink it of your mind\nYou talk about the world\nLike it\u2019s someplace that you\u2019ve been\n\nYou see you\u2019d love to run home\nBut you know you ain\u2019t got one\n'Cause you\u2019re livin\u2019 in a world\nThat you\u2019re best forgotten around here\n\nBroadway is dark tonight\nA little bit weaker\nThan you used to be\n...\n\n", 
        "Reach\nFor higher ground\nAbout the way you look\nThe way you scream out loud\nMine\nJust like the last time\nIt's all the same to me\nShe said\n\nChorus:\n\nLet's pretend\nMy January friend\nI'm wanting you again\nI wanna touch ya\nEvery single heart that beats pretend\n...\n\n", 
        "Baby's black balloon makes her fly\nI almost fell into that hole in your life\nYou're not thinking about tomorrow\n'Cause you were the same as me\nBut on your knees...\n\nA thousand other boys could never reach you\nHow could I have been the one?\nI saw the world spin beneath you\nAnd scatter like ice from the spoon\nThat was your womb...\n\nComing down, the world turned over\nAnd angels fall without you there\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you listen to yourself?\nNever live for someone else\nDo you like the way you feel?\nNothin' hurts when no one's real\n\nShe wants to shake this scene\nYes, she wants to shake with me\nShe's not lookin' for the holes in all the lies\n\nI wanna bulletproof your soul\nWould you like to lose control?\nI won't let you fall until you tell me so\n\nWhat are we?\n(What you wanna be)\nEverything\n(That you wanna be)\nAll I need\n(Right in front of me)\nI've known before\n...\n\n", 
        "Everytime you point your finger\nThree more point right back at you\nI'm not sayin' that it's something wrong with life\n'Cause that's a sad excuse\n\nAn age old game of rat and mouse\nChasin' us from house to house\nI'm not sayin' that there's something wrong with you\nIt's wrong with me as well\n\nAre you alive\nAmigone (...Miracles gone wrong)\nIs it too late to call and tell you to be strong\nAre you alive\nAmigone (...Miracles gone wrong)\nWas the poison in our love there all along\n...\n\n", 
        "Daylight burns your sleepy eyes\nIt's hard to see you dreaming\nYou hide inside yourself and\nI wonder what you're thinkin'\nAnd everything you're chasing\nIt seems to leave you empty\n\nAnd it won't take long to burn\nAll eyes on me\nThrough the nothing that you've learned\nAll eyes on me\nAnd the things you choose to be\nAll eyes on me\n...\n\n", 
        "And I've had to fight\nAnother blurred affair tonight\nEyelids wrestle once again\nNever gonna see my friend\nGuided by the blinding white\nHave you left home in spite\nKnowing I'm alone tonight\nWaiting for the light of day\nDoesn't matter anyway\nSomething that I need to say\n\n...\n\n", 
        "They painted up your secrets\nWith the lies they told to you\nAnd the least they ever gave you\nWas the most you ever knew\n\nAnd I wonder where these dreams go\nWhen the world gets in your way\nWhat's the point in all this screaming\nNo one's listening anyway\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh here you are\nThere's nothing left to say\nYou're not supposed to be that way\nDid they push you out\nDid they throw you away\nTouch me now and I don't care\nWhen you take me I'm not there\nAlmost human but I'll never be the same\n\nLong way down\nI don't think I'll make it on my own\nLong way down\nI don't want to live in here alone\nLong way down\nI don't think I'll make it on my own\n...\n\n", 
        "Ecstasy is all you need\nLiving in the big machine now\nOh you're so vain\nNow your world is way too fast\nNothing's real and nothing lasts\nAnd I'm aware\nI'm in love but you don't care\n\nTurn your anger into lust\nI'm still here but you don't trust at all\nAnd I'll be waiting\nLove and sex and loneliness\nTake what's yours and leave the rest\nSo I'll survive\nGod it's good to be alive\n\n...\n\n",

        "You lie awake at night\nWith blue eyes that never cry\nAll you remember now\nIs what you feel\n\nThe truth remains\nIn midnight conversations\nI asked for this moment\nBut you turned away\n\nSad like a lonely child\nBroken the day you're born\nI held the light to you\nBut I was so vain\n\nAnd you remain\nA promise unfulfilled\nI ask you for more\nBut you push me away\n...\n\n",

        "If I could walk a straight mile\nAnd write it down in shorthand I could show you\nIf you want me to\nAnd if I had an hourglass\nI'd save the grains of time I spent with you\nThat's what I'd do\n\nBut I remember\nYou always said it could be great\nAnd I knew it could be\n\nWell there's a way you look at things\nThat no one needs to know but you\nAnd you shared them with me\n...\n\n", 
        "Reach\nFor higher ground\nAbout the way you look\nThe way you scream out loud\nMine\nJust like the last time\nIt's all the same to me\nShe said\n\nChorus:\n\nLet's pretend\nMy January friend\nI'm wanting you again\nI wanna touch ya\nEvery single heart that beats pretend\n...\n\n", 
        "You whispered in my mouth\nAnd I spit you words right back\nHow good do you think I'll look\nWhen the words start to break and crack?\n\nYou beat your head upon your wall\nYou disconnect yourself from it all\n'Cuz you know that you're so beautiful and so untouchable\nAnd I wanna get in so bad and I don't know how\nNo, I don't know how\n\n'Cuz you're gone and you ain't coming back\n...\n\n", 
        "There's so much more about you\nThat you never let them see\nYou turned away\nBut not to me\nAnd I know how they tried to take you\nHeld you up and meant to break you down\nBut you can't be\n\nFor so long I tried to reach you\nI know I'm almost there\nI'm close enough for you to see\n\nAnd you've been hiding in the shadows\nHave you forgotten how we used to dream?\nBut let me remind you\nThe light doesn't blind you at all\n...\n\n",

        "And even though the moment passed me by\nI still can't turn away\nCuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose\nGot tossed along the way\nAnd letters that you never meant to send\nGot lost or thrown away\n\nAnd now we're grown up orphans\nAnd never knew their names\nWe don't belong to no one\nThat's a shame\nBut you could hide beside me\nMaybe for a while\n...\n\n", 
        "Said you're burnin' up inside\nNo one seems to tell\nYou're living from a personalized manual from hell\n\nLife is pretty easy when it's from my easy chair\nAnd you're burnin' up inside and no one cares\n\nSaid you had enough this time\n'Cause time don't treat you well\nYou always cried coincidence\n...\n\n"
