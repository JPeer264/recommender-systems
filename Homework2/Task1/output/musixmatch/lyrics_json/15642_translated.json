        "S\u00f3 n\u00f3s dois juntos no mesmo abra\u00e7o\nE a lua em peda\u00e7os\nBaila no ar\nWhen they begin the beguine\nIt brings back the sound of music so tender\nIt brings back a night of tropical splendor\nIt brings back a memory ever green\nI'm with you once more under the stars\nAnd down by the shore an orchestra's playing\nAnd even the palms seem to be swaying\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go\nI'm lonely in London, London is lovely so\nI cross the streets without fear\nEverybody keeps the way clear\nI know, I know no one here to say hello\nI know they keep the way clear\nAnd I am lonely in London without fear\nI'm wondering round and round here nowhere to go\nWhile my eyes\nGo looking for flying saucers in the sky\nWhile my eyes\nGo looking for flying saucers in the sky\n\n...\n\n"
