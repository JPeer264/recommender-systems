        "& I'm standing on a platform\nNow I'm staring from a train\n& all the trees roll back beside but I'm so oblivious\nTo the dark to the light\nIt's all the same\n\nYou gave me so much\n& now it's of the earth\n& it makes me cry\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Oh innocent smiles, how they put you to shame\nSame televised lines, I've seen the film before\nSicilian men, they're going to save their name\nLeaving their brides in black shawls again\n\nSee how it's shining through the dark\nAs the teardrops fall and it illuminates the room\nAnd we can't stop staring for a moment\n\nSome silver-screen starlet\nBut it's my story she's living in\nIn a smoke-filled room pressed up against the door\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Build me up don't get me down,\nweather the storm.\nWell, life goes on.\nFeelings ebb and flow by hour.\nYou're up in the clouds,\nand then you sink like a stone.\n\nSo do you fill yourself with pills\nto deaden your ills?\nOr are you only one love short of happiness?\nAnd in a picture on the wall\nno glimmer of yourself at all.\nYou've let yourself fall away.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
