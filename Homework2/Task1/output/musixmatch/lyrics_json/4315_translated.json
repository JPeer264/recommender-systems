        "I am not going to talk about the darkness,\nBest I will see if I can wake up.\nI do not want to talk about so many things,\nBest I will see if I can remember ...\n\nWhile traveling toward salt, and if I do not understand\nis right or wrong,\nAnd I cold in the darkness.\n...\n\n", 
        "I've got to leave now\nLeave this frozen and overcrowded town,\nAnd catch the first train,\nNot knowing it's destination.\nI 'm gazing at people\nEach of them, those lifeless things,\nAs I travel through the\nMoody and rainy autumn night.\n\nMetal grates on metal,\nThe shrilly scream of the\nBrakes wake me. People get down,\nStaring at me strangely,\nI glare at them\n...\n\n", 
        "Drowning in those waves of smoke \nWhich summits stand out like living roots \nI feel them seizing me, wrapping me up, devouring me. \n\nHere. They come, on and on, \nLike plants born of satanic seeds \n\nCultivated in the Pandemonium, \nThey're going through the ground as if it did not exist, \nSprayed with innocent blood, \n...\n\n", 
        "I remember now.\nMoon said take him, take\n(...take him, take)\nIt was in this town\n(to start is so hard)\nThousand images in my head\n(but to continue is your faith)\n\nWind was very cold\nWeapon were my hands\nBlood was very hot\nSanity runs across the land\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't want to commit suicide in this place \nBut I would like to leave my body one day \nJust to see the decay of the human race \nAnd tears in your eyes which will not stay \n\nSouls of black possess me \nMy heart is full of darkness \n...\n\n", 
        "Crazy girl, you just have to smile \nShow your legs, turn them blind \nKill' em all, you're afraid \nCause they are still alive \n\n[CHORUS]\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The sweat runs on your face \nAs the nightmares take place \nAlways the same vision \nFamily slaughter comes on \nThis hell inside your head \nShows you people dead \nYou can think you' re insane \nCause you can' t stop this pain \n...\n\n", 
        "I can see you through the surface \nI know that you calling me \nI can see you through the surface \nDiscovering more than others see \n\nMovements of waves distort your face \nBut you make me feel you're so beautiful \nThere are no pain and no disgrace \nThis world seems so peacefully \n\n[CHORUS]\n\nJust fall into the water \n...\n\n", 
        "I was trying to sweep away all my desires,\nI threw out emotions, my emotions\nJust to live in neutrality cause I know \nYou only came to leave me, you leave me\n\nYou've already see turned back\nAnd left me/you in this way, \nI/you don't want to believe you/me, to believe you\n\nSo you are/I am far away, \nEach step that you/I make takes me/you far away, \nI don't want to trust you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, priestess of my dreams,\nwhen under the April moon you appeared\nStealing my soul and my thoughts,\nI could have loved to taste your lips\n\nOh, priestess of my dreams Ho,\nthis dark mysterious voice\nis coming out of the night to me\n\nMy soul's trembling from flurry\n...\n\n", 
        "Body lies on the floor\nVery sick complexion\nMovements drive your lips\nNo more words and no more breath\n\nI can feel my tears\nRunning on my cheeks\nI can feel my reason\nLeaving my body\n\nI can feel spirits\nTurning above me\nMy will is not very powerful\nAnd my consciousness is fading out\n...\n\n", 
        "His tears are running in the fire, \nWhose flames are burning his eyes \nHe's running on some dusty waves believing\nHe can't reach the sea, \nLost in silent Height invaded \nWith a steaming mist and by the wind, \nSwept away\nSad ephemeral creature, \nMoaning on earth\nHis sight gets lost on those immensities\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm imprisoned with the entire world, I'm insane\nEnslaved to suffer your madness\nTorn is my mind, destined to magnify all my hate\nI am meant to rise above you\nFooled will be your entire purpose to stop me\nI will defy all your kind\nYou have no idea what's aiming for your heart\nI shall bathe in all your blood\n\nI shall rise before you, look in your eyes, tear off your limbs\nPeel off the flesh that I loath\nRapturous are your screams, I gain pleasure,\nErase my pain through the spilling of your blood\n\nI will not be stopped, nothing will quench my rage\nFor your horrid ways\nTo control all my thoughts, my very action\nDictated by your laws, enforced by your greed\n\nStrengthened now to become my only purpose\nTo cut your throat and tear out your ruling voice\nYour voice of resentment for all that we are\nSoon our voices will ring loud through all the world\n...\n\n", 
        "Anger, despair and tears guide\nMy hands upon this parchment\nMy torments will stop now\nBecause my destiny, I master\n\nNo one lays down his arms\nThe next day always comes\nI only can live without it\nOr die in betrayal\n\nMy will is weakened and \nI am a wretched fighter\nMy consciousness slowly \n...\n\n", 
        "I remember\nYour heavenly face underwater\nAdmiring its whiteness\nUnder the moon rays\nAnd the life going out\nOf your magnificent wounds\n\nWraps up of red your naked flesh\nOn your pearly nails, the subdued light\nGleam under water in a deep silence\nAnd your veins, in a complexe network\n...\n\n", 
        "As a sad face\nSailing and slides\nIn a bright ocean\nPursing a kind life\nUnder a flapping rain\nOf steam of mist\n\nAnd in this bar\nHe fails and drinks\nAnd in this burning\nAlcohol he sinks down\nForgetting his misfortune,\nHis anxiety and his fear\n\nIl entre dans l'all\u00e9e royale,\nD\u00e9fie ses sujets,\n...\n\n"
