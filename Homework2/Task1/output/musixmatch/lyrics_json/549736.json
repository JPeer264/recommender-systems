        "I still don\u2019t know who I am\nThe only thing I know is that my name is Sam\nAnd I wonder where I lived\nI remember a soldier and he\u2019s giving me a gift\nAnd I\u2019m bleeding\nI lay down in a hole all alone, without a meaning\nAnd I suffer\nYet I\u2019m still alive and I have nothing more to offer\nOh, I\u2019m not scared, I am ready\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "You and I know what we're fighting for\nA moment of glory, a flash of our destiny\nEver last that's why our love is together\nLove may and lose control\nWhen you say forever we re\u2026\n\nI know are dreams stand fall apart\nDon't let that happen with our hearts\nJust close your eyes and dry your tears\nGirl, I can't wait a few more years\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "People always say\n\"Tom, this has gone too far\"\nBut I'm not afraid to chase my dreams\nJust me and my guitar\n\nAnd no one may ever know\nThe feelings inside my mind\n'Cause all of the lines I ever write\nAre running out of time\n\nSo maybe I should get a nine to five\nBut I don't wanna let it go\nThere's so much more to life\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
