        "Another trifling day, one more soul-stifling day of blinding pain:\nBoredom grinds my brain down to the grain.\nA man could go quite mad and not be all that bad.\nConsider each superb, disturbing urge you've ever had\nTo curse aloud in church or choke each bloke who\nThrows a smile your way...\nBe that as it may.\n\nA man could have bad dreams and not be all he seems.\nYet not be far-removed from all the noblest of extremes.\n...\n\n",

        "Crime don't pay... that's what I tells 'em.\nIf it did, would I be here mixing pipes,\nWot then I sells 'em for a pint of rotten beer?\nThroats you cut to pocket tuppence,\nThen you slut to cop some sleep.\nBash a face for bleedin' tuppence -\npure disgrace to work so cheap.\n\nSo I say, don't be a sinner for the price of London gin.\n...\n\n", 
        "Ceylon... Ceylon\nBy the Bengal Bay,\n\nEast of Jaipur,\nWest of Mandalay!\n\nAgra... Patna...\nSholapur and Kolhapur and all,\n\nHow far they are\nFrom the High Street and the Market Hall\n\nIt's all very well for you\nTo speak of this distant view,\nBut Rosa what's planned for me\nIs grander than sand and sea!\nThis vista that's in my sight\nWhere I'll set the world alright\nAwaits me...\nIt dominates me.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I am not myself these days - for all I\nknow I might be you.\nThere's more than room enough for two inside my mind.\n\nI am likewise in a haze of who I am from\nscene to scene;\nWhat's more we two, (we four, I mean)\nare in a bind!\n\nFor is it I or is it me?\n\nAnd if I'm him and if I'm he, each on of us might not\nAgree on what to do.\n\nAnd if I take opposing sides within myself,\nThen who divides up what is right or wrong?\nI'll go along with you.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Can you remember remember my name\nAs I flow through your life\nA thousand oceans I have flown\nAnd cold spirits of ice\nAll my life\nI am the echo of your past\n\nI am returning the echo of a point in time\nDistant faces shine\nA thousand warriors I have known\nAnd laughing as the spirits appear\n...\n\n", 
        "Sir I don't much like your tone, that supercilious sneer you wear!\nClear, you wear a finer cut than mine,\nAh but a waistcoat worn can soon be torn,\nA weed like you. Should bleed your blood so blue\n\nSomething in this speech seems ominous to me!\n\nTwin, don't over preach, pray promise this to me!\n\nPraise to him divine!

        "I was tired of my lady\nWe'd been together to long\nLike a warn out recording of a favorite song\nSo while she lay there sleeping\nI read the paper in bed\nAnd in the personal columns\nThere was this letter I read\nIf you like pina colada's\n\nAnd gettin' caught in the rain\nIf your not into yoga\nIf you have half a brain\nIf you like making love at midnight\nIn the dunes on the cape\nI'm the love that you've looked for\nWrite to me and escape\nI didn't think about my lady\n\nI know that sounds kinda mean\nBut me and my old lady\nHad fallen into the same old dull routine\nSo I wrote to the paper\n...\n\n", 
        "Over by the window\nThere's a pack of cigarettes\nNot my brand, you understand\nSometimes the girl forgets\n\nShe forgets to hide them\nI know who left those smokes behind\nShe'll say, \"Oh he's just a friend\"\nAnd I'll say, \"Oh, I'm not blind to\n\nHim, him, him\nWhat's she gonna do about him\nShe's gonna have to do without him\nOr do without me, me, me\nNo one gets to get it for free\nIt's me or it's him\n\nDon't know what he looks like\n...\n\n",

        "There are songs that sound like movies\nThere are themes that fill the screen\nThere are lines I say that sound as if they're written\nThere are looks I wear the theater should have seen\nBut though I've made my life a movie\nThe matinee must end by five\nAnd I must stagger out into the blinding sunlight half alive\nWishing I were back inside the picture show\nThere where it's always night\nNotice how the screen is wide\nThe second role I've said around too tight\nWill I stay? Yes, I might\nOh widescreen wider on my eyes\n...\n\n",

        "I met her at a baseball game\nThat got held up by August rain\nBeneath the mezzanine I huddled up against her hand\nBy then the rain had left the ground\nAnd Seger threw a few on the mound\nWe stood to face the flag that flew above the Navy band\nThen the anthem began to blare through the stadium\nIt rang through the open air\nAnd I knew this was the time to make my pitch\n\nWon't you come home with me?\nI've a room you should see\nWith a warm waterbed\nAnd pillow for your head\nI've a robe you could wear\n...\n\n",

        "At a dance, I'm standing there\nSuddenly approached by a lady fair\nSaid to me 't'ain't no lie'\nIf I can't have you I'd surely die\nPsychodrama City, don't need none today\n\nMy good friends say to me\nThe world will end soon, wait you'll see\n...\n\n"
