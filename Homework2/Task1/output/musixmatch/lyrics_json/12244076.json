        "Wake up in the morning feeling' like P'Diddy\ngrab my glasses I'm out the door I'm bout to hit this city\nwhen I leave brush my teeth with a bottle of jack\ncause when I leave for the night I ain't coming back\n\nI'm talking pedicure on our toes, trying on all our clothes\n\"scenies\" blowing up our phones\ndrop topping' playing our favorite CDs pulling up to the parties\n\ntrying to get a little bit tipsy\nDon't stop make it pop\nDJ blow my speakers up\n\ntonight Imma fight till we see the sunlight\ntik tok on the clock\nthe party don't stop no, no, no\nAin't got a care in the world but got plenty of beer ain't got no money in my pocket but I'm already here\n...\n\n", 
        "Murder the man who devoured your god\n...\n\n", 
        "Visitor, come to my room\nAnd see all the trash I've made\nStay a while\n\nI'm on the verge of\nLaying it down\n\nA vagabond\nAnd all his trash\nIn search to find his crown\nYour mind is like a candle stick\nAnd my ambitions\nAre constantly burning out\nI'd hate to\nRain on your parade\n\nBut everything you know\nIs taken by this flood\nYou were blind but there's no hope\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Six feet under the earth is where you'll reside\nIt's time to see the bastard you've become,\nBecause I know your father didn't raise you this way\nThe apple doesn't fall far from the tree,\nAnd everybody says, you're just like me\nI begin to lift up my own flaws, to better you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Hindsight is my only flaw\nRight after we fail it's easy to realize the things we've lost\nPush comes to shove, their only excuse is we do it out of love\n\nThere we flee trying to please everyone that we see fit for the trifold\nBehind everything, inside we choose to hide\nBecause we have the sense to do this for the sake of pride\n...\n\n", 
        "You've taken all my will to\nExploit my face behind these hands\nAnd you're far to shallow to drown me in your follies\nYou wont make it far, this is bigger than who we are\nHow could you get this far, with such a bitter plan, building all these scars\nJust go ahead, pull us out, to sea, relapse to what you were\nSuch a commodity for you and me to be lost at sea,\nYou drug me out here but honestly,\nI can sleep and preach much better now, in the clear,\n...\n\n", 
        "Leave me here, biting my nails, breaking my stride,\nI put my faith into your desolate life\nHappen so fast that I won't be afraid I won't be afraid\nThree years blessed, I gave it my best, it's time to put it all to rest\nYour present is my past\n\nThrough my eyes, I've seen nothing but time, forty four thousand lies\nStraight from your putrid mind\n...\n\n", 
        "The devil and god are knocking at my door\nI thought I had your word\nThat a father dies before his son\nNow the reaper and his men are marching your way\nStraight to hell\n\nAll that you taught me to be\nWas a moper, a dreamer that only refused to dream\nOh save it please\nMy voice is peaking through your speakers\nAnd I'm speaking just to show you the way\nHow could you\nShelter me out\nI'm much older now\nYou're a chemical fiend\nYou shatter like a beaker\nWhen I only want to show you the way\n\nThe architect, the creator\n...\n\n", 
        "Stop!\nI stand here as a man who holds his ground,\nSo silence your hands,\nI'm everything you once held dear.\n\nHow can you sleep\n\nHow can you sleep at night,\nToo many you were rights,\nI have no home,\nMy home is non-existent\nSo long,\nI was here but you missed it,\nSo kiss this,\nI hope you know you pissed it away.\n\nSo cut me out,\n...\n\n", 
        "I think you've just about lost, your sense of self,\nYour foundations are crumbling down\n\nI told you so, told you so\nDon't be the one to say you know what's right\nI told you so, told you so\nDon't be the one to say you know my heart\nDon't be torn from your roots, you won't live in this pursuit\nYou won't survive above this ground,\n...\n\n", 
        "Out in the everglades,\nSleeping in with the poor is a fortune for the brave,\nI can easily say that we will never change\nBut be implacable and never lose your flames.\n\nWouldn't you say that the world has spit on you enough.\nUnanswered prayers, sleeping under streetlights\n...\n\n",
