        "Come a little bit closer\nAnd hear what I've got to say\nBurning words of anger\nOf hate and desperation\n\nWhat if I break the silence?\nWhat if I do forgive the past?\nWhat if I break the silence?\nWhat if I do forgive the past?\n\nI know it might sound funny\nTo tell you what I felt\nI mean, I really loved you\nIt's a shame, my fault I know\n\nBut why? But why?\nWhy are you so stupid?\nBut why? But why?\nWhy are you so stupid?\n\nFuck you and your killing lies\nI hate your pissing attitude\n...\n\n",

        "When you have the will\nYou learn to forgive and to forget\nYou have to -\nCollect the broken pieces and\nHumble hearted\nStand up from the place you hide\nIf I wouldn't know to miss anything\nIt couldn't hurt me no more\nMistakes tought to build life\nFrom the ashes, that fell down to ground\n\nWithout any pain it wouldn't be the same\nExperiences made me strong -\nNot every pain hurts\n...\n\n",
