        "Tired of slippin' and slidin' with a long tall Sally\nPeekin' and a hidin', duckin' back in the alley\nDon't wanna rip it up, don't wanna dance with Annie\nI've got a brand new lover name is Short Fat Fannie\n\nOne day while I was visit'n at HeartBreak Hotel\nThat's where I met Fannie and she sure looked swell\nI told her that I loved her I'd never leave\nShe put her arms around me, gave me fever\n\nShe's my tutti fruiti, I love the child so\nShe watch me like a hound dog everywhere I go\nWhenever I'm around her I'm on my p's and q's\nShe might step on my blue suede shoes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "\u00a0\n\nI got a girl named Bony Moronie.\nShe's as skinny as a stick of macaroni.\nOught to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on.\nShe's not very fat, just skin and bone.\nBut I love her and she loves me.\nWe're all happy now as we can be.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "You got the kinda face that I can't resist\nYou got the kinda lips that ought to be kissed\nYou got that funny little look, baby, in your eye\nOooh-wee baby\nI just want to die\n\nYou bug me baby\n\nWhen we go riding in the pale moonlight\nAll I wanna to do is hold-a you tight\nYou whisper come, come close to me\nOoo-wee baby\nI'm in ecstasy\n\nYou bug me baby\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
