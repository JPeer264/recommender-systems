        "Lay, baby, lay,\nLay across my big, brass bed.\nLay, baby, lay,\nLay across my big, brass bed.\n\nWhatever colors you have in your mind,\nI'm gonna show them to ya and I'll make them shine.\nLay, baby, lay,\nLay across my big, brass bed.\n\nStay, baby, stay,\nStay with your woman awhile.\n...\n\n", 
        "It's early mornin'. I should be in bed.\nI guess you better go now.\nGot to work tomorrow. Rather sleep instead.\nBut remember my baby must be fed.\n\nSee you lookin' like you wanna kiss me now.\nI've seen that look before.\nWhat's the use now, use in trying now,\nTrying now what didn't work before?\n\nLet's remember now, things are different now.\nWe both know where we stand.\n...\n\n", 
        "When I think about the good love you gave me\nI cry like a baby.\nLivin' without you is driving me crazy.\nI cry like a baby.\n\nLord knows now that you're not a plaything,\nNot a toy, or a puppet on a string.\n\nWhen I think about a love so sweet now\nI cry like a baby.\nEvery road is a lonely street now.\nI cry like a baby.\n...\n\n", 
        "Take me to heart\nAnd I'll always love you.\nAnd nobody can make me do wrong.\nTaking me for granted,\nLeaving love unshown,\nMakes willpower weak and temptation strong.\n\nA woman's only human.\nYou should understand.\nShe's not just a plaything,\n...\n\n", 
        "When you meet a boy\nThat you like a lot\nAnd you fall in love\nBut he loves you not\n\nIf a flame should start\nAs you hold him near\nBetter keep your heart\nOut of danger, dear\n\nFor the way of love\nIs a way of woe\nAnd the day may come\nWhen you'll see him go\n...\n\n", 
        "I was born in the wagon of a travelin' show\nMy mama used to dance for the money they'd throw\nPapa would do whatever he could\nPreach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good\nGypsys, tramps, and thieves\nWe'd hear it from the people of the town\nThey'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves\nBut every night all the men would come around\nAnd lay their money down\nPicked up a boy just south of Mobile\nGave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal\nI was sixteen, he was twenty-one\nRode with us to Memphis\n...\n\n", 
        "They go off leaving me behind.\nThey have so many worlds to find.\nI run to catch a glimpse of them,\nJust watching in the sun,\nKnowing they'll be mine again\nWhen evening has begun.\n\nAnd when I see them hand in hand,\nThe boy who walks beside the man,\nI pray that I will always have\nThe world that I have found.\n...\n\n", 
        "I've seen fire and I've seen rain.\nI've seen sunny days I thought would never end.\nI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.\nBut I always thought that I'd see you agian.\n\nJust yesterday mornin' they let me know that you were gone.\nSeems them plans they'd made put an end to you.\nI walked out this mornin' and I wrote down this song.\nI just can't remember who to send it to.\n\nI've seen fire and I've seen rain.\nI've seen sunny days I thought would never end.\nI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.\nBut I always thought that I'd see you again.\n...\n\n", 
        "When you find out where you're goin',\nLet me know.\n'Cause I love you just enough\nTo let you go.\nWhen you're runnin' free and clear,\nPlease don't disappear.\nWhen you find out where you're goin',\nLet me know.\n\nWhen you find out where you're goin',\nCount me in.\n...\n\n", 
        "The road is long\nWith many a windin' turn\nThat leads us to who\nKnows where, who knows where.\nBut I'm strong.\nI'm strong enough to carry him.\nHe ain't heavy.\nHe's my brother.\n\nSo on we go.\nHis welfare is my concern.\n...\n\n", 
        "You were the only thing I had\nHow could a good love go so bad?\nSomehow I guess I should have known\nThat you would leave me here alone\n\nThey say you found somebody new\nBut that won't change my love for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't make no difference if you laid down and cried.\nYou know that you lied to me.\nAnd if you come to me with tears in your eyes,\nDon't say goodbye.\nJust leave.\n\n'Cause I'm in the middle of somethin'\nI don't understand.\nHow can my reasons for livin'\nSlip right through my hands?\nI'm in the middle of somethin'\nI don't understand.\nAnd it looks like I lose again.\n\nDon't make no difference what you think of me.\n...\n\n", 
        "I know we can make it, baby,\nIf only we tried.\nLet's hang on to love\nAnd don't let it die.\nEven though...\n\nIt's been touch and go,\nOff and on,\nWeak and strong.\nBut then we didn't know\nThat with hope we could cope.\nWith all the ups and downs.\nSo please stay around.\nI need you so.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't find a four-leaf clover rainbow.\nI could find it if I wanted to.\nI believe if you put your mind to somethin'\nWell there ain't anything in this world\nYou could not do.\n\nWhat I can't find:\nOne honest mind.\nWhy can't I find me\nOne honest mind?\nDon't understand.\n\nThe only thing I ever wanted\nWas a little bouquet of truth from him.\n...\n\n"
