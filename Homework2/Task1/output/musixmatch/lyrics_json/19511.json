        "They lasted as long as a spark shines\nbut their shining was so bright\nthat it was caught forever\nin the spectre of time.\nWhat was a fact became a legend\nwhat was reality became a faded canvas\nin the mausoleum of civilizations.\n\nLandscapes of untold antiquity\nunchanged are calling\nto an orgy of colours and shapes\nin a drunkenness with pure fantasy\n\nTheir names cause awe and awake\nforgotten senses\n...\n\n", 
        "The mist unfolds its veil\nas the night falls in the forest\nThe moisty wind forces the trees\nto sing their sorrow.\nFor centuries they are standing still\nlike a petrified dream.\nTraped bodies in a wooden web,\ntall towers of another epoch.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When the fields are red\nlike a crimson robe\nand the name of the \"King\" who wears\nthis robe is MAN\nthe waves of wrath have been released\nto drown the \"sinister\" and different.\n\nNoble causes sink in oceans of bodies\nwhere flesh and steel is one.\nMemories of Ancient Wars\nremove the frozen bonds of time.\n...\n\n", 
        "The sand beneath your feet\na yellow carpetin\nthe palace of wilderness\nOnly king and servant is you\nsearching for the pyramid\nthat guards the emerald board\n\nIt was a crescent moon\nwhen you have been initiated\nin the science of the black earth,\nAnd the optimism of youth\npushed you in quests\n...\n\n", 
        "My mood is like the weather\nit changes with unexpected ways\ncreating a mosaic\nbased on the antithesis\nof cold and warm colours\n\nIf you could read in my eyes\nyou would discover a shade of grey\nwhen I smile\nbecause even when (I am) collecting\n...\n\n", 
        "Melancholy ascended in the surface\nknowing that she'll have forever a lair\nin the underwater garden.\nSerene the azure body that filled\nthe landscape crowled as ever.\n\nThe sound here is a word without a\nmeaning nothing can agitate the\nmonotony.\nThe new and the old event roll indolent\n...\n\n", 
        "In an empty room eyes without a face.\nThey are stirring other images,\nglimpses of a distant life,\nof a gone life.\n\nThe hands cannot identify the face\nBehind the Iron Mask\n\nDim is within on the plane of the mind\n...\n\n", 
        "I was sailling in the sea of lethargy\nupon an empty dream\nwhen land appeared\nand filled the endless horizon.\nWhite pilars from marble\ndeep into a garden\nwere shining like guiding stars.\nThe Dreamlord\nA frozen voice from inside\npoured out in my dreamworld\n...\n\n", 
        "[music: SOTIRIS]\n\nWaiting the drawing of the underworld\nnone to share your fears.\nThe shadow of CHARON falls\nupon the stone of hopes.\nThe body is paralizing.\nThe air is too thick to enter.\na cataclysm is spawend into the regions of the soul.\nThe cry of the first time\nwhen you were free from the womb,\nis the same but now you are entering the night.\n...\n\n", 
        "[music: SPIROS/SOTIRIS]\n\nPreserved from the ancient years\nwhen Earth was just a newborn star\nThe proof of a distant truth\narrogantly stands mocking the wind\nguarding mysteries that man has not unchained.\n\nAn emblem of power has remained, a fallen temple...\n\nFaded pictures all over the walls\nprojecting a horrid state of sanity.\nFigures that don't belong to a human race\n...\n\n", 
        "[music: CHRIS/SPIROS]\n\nIn a world of endless light, into the boundless space\ntwo suns the only gods, two burning holes in the sky.\n\n[SOLO: CHRIS]\n\nWithout a warning the two suns slowly faded\nabandoning their only children unprotected from the cold.\n...\n\n"
