        "Looking from a distance, seems like I've lost it all\nAnd everyone around me is waiting for this girl to fall\nBut my heart is missing, I just lost control\nIf I don't know why, why would I know how?\n\nI've been working with the devils, trying to exercise\nMy feelings, I've been hiding down on a darker side\nBut what's I'm taking in trading, never sold my soul\nI'm simply movin' on, goin', gone\n\nThink, I'm losin' the fight to make sense of it all\nGot to build all my life, so I'm safe from the fall\nI'm subjected, expected to know what I feel\nBut I don't feel nothin', it's alright, no big deal\n(It's alright, it's alright, no big deal)\nNo big deal\n...\n\n",

        "We can run away together\nIf that's what you want\nWe can hide away forever\nIf that's what you want\n\nSo just\nClose the door\nLet nobody else in our head\nClose the door\nWe can lay right here in our bed\n\n'Cause anything else is wasting time\nYou're all I've wanted\nAll of my life\nJust let me grow old\nHere by your side\nUntil the end of time\nTill the last goodbye\n\nLet's just live here in the moment\nSharing something real\n...\n\n", 
        "Now\nTomorrow is all there is\nNo need to look behind the door\nYou won't be standing there no more\nI had my chance\nTo dance another dance\nI didn't even realize\nThat this was all love\nAnd no lies\nThen lost you\n\nWhile\nI guess I loved you\nOh, less, less than I should\nNow all there is is me and me\n...\n\n",

        "\"Adagio\" English\n\nI don't know where to find you\nI don't know how to reach you\nI hear your voice in the wind\nI feel you under my skin\nWithin my heart and my soul\nI wait for you\nAdagio\nAll of these nights without you\nAll of my dreams surround you\nI see and I touch your face\n...\n\n"
