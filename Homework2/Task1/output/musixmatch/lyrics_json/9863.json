        "It seems the day that your house burned to the ground\nWas the day that you'd always planned to leave anyway\nAnd the vast empire you come through to get here\nMakes the world look like pennies in my hand\nI'll never let go, I'll never let go you said out loud\nI'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out\nYour words shook me right out of a daydream\n...\n\n", 
        "It's like we just can't help ourselves\nCause we don't know how to back down\nWe were called out to the streets\nWe were called out into the towns\nHow the heaven's they opened up\nLike arms of dazzling gold\nWith our rain washed histories\nWhen we're do not need to be told\n\nShow me now\nShow me the arms aloft\n...\n\n", 
        "Your engine threatens, I can hear it from the garden\nI can see it coming, I can see it come from miles\nWhat you're thinking right now, 'cause I think that I can guess\nIf we set off now, we'll have the highway to ourselves\n\nAnd you love the little signs of life,\nYou love it when we lose our minds\nYou love these little wars of words,\nYou love it when they call your name, your name\n\nA new empire beckons, a new kingdom in the distance\nNo gods are present, just the sky, the earth, and us\nNo wings, no halos, nor the thunder in the footsteps\nCause fear and anger they are a law unto themselves\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You can't find the phone\nSo you can call it off\nBut it might be for the best\nYou can't walk away, anyway\nBecause you've nowhere else to go\n\nIs he worth all this?\nIs it a simple yes?\nBecause if you have to think, it's fucked\nFeels like you've loved him more\nThan he loved you\nAnd you wish you'd never met\n\nDon't keel over now\nDon't keel over\nDon't keel over now\nDon't keel over\n\nYou've been up all night\nAnd the night before\nAnd you've lost counts of drinks and time\nAnd your friends keep calling, worried sick\nAnd there's strangers everywhere\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There's the river, there's your house and there's the church\nAnd there's us years ago\nDeep in your garden where the nettle met the rose\nIs where we'd hide ourselves\n\nYes, we were just kids\nBut you couldn't tell us that\nThese are the garden rules\nIt's what you always said\n\nOh, you will never know how much I love you so\nOh, you will never know how much I love you\n\nYou would call the garden rules, out like commands\nAnd we would all obey\n...\n\n", 
        "You called my name in the dark\nCalled me back to the start\nThe condensation is building tension\n\nStubborn silence is formed\nAround our bodies it's warm\nThe cool wet grasses as summer passes\n\nFrightened under attack\nFallen flat on my back\nArms and legs I'm too scared to beg\n\nHarm me most when it's light\nThought of you don't sit right\nI need the darkness a desperate embrace\n\n...\n\n",

        "A hand upon my forehead\nThe joke and then the laugh\nWaking up in your arms\nA place to call my own\n\nThis is all I ever wanted from life\nThis is all I ever wanted from life\nThis is all I ever wanted from life\n\nIreland in the world cup\nEither north or south\nThe fanclub on the jukebox\nThe birds and yes the bees\n...\n\n", 
        "If you were here beside me, instead of in New York\nIf the curve of you was curved on me\nI'd tell you that I loved you, before I ever knew you\nCause I loved the simple thought of you\nIf our hearts are never broken, then there's no joy in the mending\nThere's so much this hurt can teach us both\nThough there's distance and there's silence, your words have never left me\nThey're the prayer that I say every day\nCome on, come out, come here, come here\nCome on, come out, come here, come here\nCome on, come out, come here, come here\n...\n\n",

        "Train this chaos turn it into light,\nI've gotta see you one last night,\nBefore the lions take their share,\nLeave us in pieces, scattered everywhere,\n\nJust give me a chance to hold on,\nGive me a chance to hold on,\nGive me a chance to hold on,\nJust give me something hold onto,\n\nIt's so clear now that you are all that I have,\nI have no fear cause you are all that I have,\nIt's so clear now that you are all that I have,\nI have no fear cause you are all that I have,\n...\n\n", 
        "It's hard to argue when\nYou won't stop making sense\nBut my tongue still misbehaves\nAnd it keeps digging my own grave\n\nWith my hands open and my eyes open\nI just keep hoping\nThat your heart opens\n\nWhy would I sabotage\nThe best thing that I have?\nWell, it makes it easier to know\nExactly what I want\n\nWith my hands open and my eyes open\nI just keep hoping\nThat your heart opens\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We'll do it all\nEverything\nOn our own\n\nWe don't need\nAnything\nOr anyone\n\nIf I lay here\nIf I just lay here\nWould you lie with me and just forget the world?\n\nI don't quite know\nHow to say\nHow I feel\n\nThose three words\nAre said too much\n...\n\n", 
        "Shut your eyes and think of somewhere\nSomewhere cold and caked in snow\nBy the fire, we break the quiet\nLearn to wear each other well\n\nAnd when the worrying starts to hurt\nAnd the world feels like graves of dirt\nJust close your eyes until\nYou can imagine this place\nYou're our secret space at will\n\nShut your eyes, I spin the big chair\n...\n\n", 
        "I want something \nThat's purer than the water \nLike we were \n\nIt's not there now \nIneloquence and anger \nAre all we have \n\nLike Saturn's rings \nAn icy loop around me \nToo hard to hold \n\nLash out first \nAt all the things we don't like \nOr understand \n\nAnd It's Beginning To Get To Me \nThat I know more of the stars and sea \nThan I do of what's in your head \nBarely touching in our cold bed \n\n...\n\n",

        "Please don't let this turn into something it's not\nI can only give you everything I've got\nI can't be as sorry as you think I should\nBut I still love you more than anyone else could\n\nAll that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight\nIs it could take my whole damn life to make this right\nThis splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long\nBecause I know fine well that what I did was wrong\n\nThe last girl in the last reason to make this last for as long\nas I could\nFirst kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything\n\nThe weight of water, the way you told me to look past everything\nI had ever learned\n...\n\n", 
        "I find the map and draw a straight line\nOver rivers, farms, and state lines\nThe distance from here to where you'd be\nIt's only finger-lengths that I see\n\nI touch the place\nWhere I'd find your face\nMy fingers in creases\nOf distant dark places\n\nI hang my coat up in the first bar\nThere is no peace that I've found so far\nThe laughter penetrates my silence\nAs drunken men find flaws in science\n\n...\n\n", 
        "For once I want to be the car crash\nNot always just the traffic jam\nHit me hard enough to wake me\nAnd lead me wild to your dark roads\n\nHeadlights before me\nSo beautiful, so clear\nReach out and take it\n...\n\n", 
        "All this feels strange and untrue\nAnd I won't waste a minute without you\nMy bones ache, my skin feels cold\nAnd I'm getting so tired and so old\nThe anger swells in my guts\nAnd I won't feel these slices and cuts\nI want so much to open your eyes\nCos I need you to look into mine\n\nTell me that you'll open your eyes\nTell me that you'll open your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "You could get arrested for\nGetting your kit off in the street\nHow many times have I told you\nIt's not polite to meet and greet\n\nWe'll get you home and wash you up\nIn a bath of cold coffee\nI only do this 'cause I love you\nAnd you can make things easier\n...\n\n", 
        "Andrew's a Starfighter Pilot\nAnd he can get high in his jet\nTells me about all his women\nHe can get any, I'll bet\n\nYou know I'll think of you\nYour picture on the wall\nI would raise my drink to you\nBut I'll stay sober just for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Take her home\nTake her past this evening\nI'm not sure\nSure if I believe you\n\nYou carry a gun for fun\nYou use it twice as easy\nI'm sure she is\nShe is someone's daughter\n\nI couldn't even feel that\nIt was wrapped around my head\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Her gravity make me feel light headed\nSmall talk turns to dust in my mouth, mouth\nShe doesn't know that I'm already thinking 'bout\nHow I'm gonna make her look my way\n\nBut she smiles at herself in mirrors\n...\n\n", 
        "Cut my eyes out, dear\nSo I can't see your smug grin\nYou're right, you always win\n\nUntie my hands now\nI'm game up to a point\nAnd we're well past bedtime now\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I could help myself to something like\nA little bit of revelation\nYou could be the one\nTo help me help myself\n\nMaybe if I could see exactly\n...\n\n",

        "I wish I had a penny for\nEvery time she gave me those eyes\nThose eyes would cry, \"Take me on the floor\"\n\nI've been with her once of twice\nIn my dreams, it felt so nice\nI'd do exactly what those eyes told me\n\nThere's never a smile on your face\nAlways a gesture of disgrace\n...\n\n", 
        "If I could understand this better\nI might be a little closer to you\nBrushing my face with her hair\nAs she pushes past towards the door\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh velocity girl\nWhat makes you go so fast\nIs it the speed you're taking\nSince you gave up the drinkin'\n\nOh velocity girl\nI can't keep up with you\nCan't stand to be alone\nThink you should be with me\n\nJust wanna stay here in your arms\n\n...\n\n"
