        "Sally called when she got the word\nShe said \"I suppose you've heard, 'bout Alice\"\nSo I rushed to the window and I looked outside\nAnd I could hardly believe my eyes\nAs a big limousine rode up into Alice's drive.\nOh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go\nI guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know\n'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice\nTwenty-four years just waitin' for a chance\nTo tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance\nNow I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice\n...\n\n", 
        "Love has shaken me, sometimes mistaken me\nThis time it's makin' me hide\nLove has told on me then got a hold on me\nFollowed my heart to my pride\n\nBut something's been makin' me blue\nAnd somehow I can't talk it over with you\nSomething's been makin' me sad\nSomethin' I'm missin' that I never had\nAnd I know what's makin' me blue is losing you\n\nLove was a game you played, a mistake I made\nNever found it on time\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't play your Rock n' Roll to me,\nThat ain't the way it's meant to be.\nI ain't so blind that I can't see,\nJust let it lie and let it be,\nSo, don't play your Rock n' Roll, no,\nDon't play your Rock n' Roll, no,\nDon't play your Rock n' Roll to me.\n\nWell I know you think I'm crazy to keep hanging 'round,\nBut I was sort of hoping you'd change from the girl I found,\nBut your words just sound like Rock n' Roll lines to me,\nAnd they're just about as burned out as a worn-out 45,\n...\n\n", 
        "Open up your tired eyes\nAnd force yourself to smile\nYesterday was yesterday\nIt's gone, it's tomorrow now\nIt's here, it's tomorrow now\nNow I must go\nBut I'll see you again\n\nWhen? oh when?\nPlease don't ask me when\nI'll call, I'll write\nBut I can not stay here tonight\nNo, I can not stay here tonight\nI can't stay here tonight\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I met a girl in L.A. and she seemed alright to me,\nShe said she'd give me loving and she said it would be free,\nShe told me she would call me or leave a message at the door,\nAnd left me wondering what I was in for.\n\nBy the next time that I saw her I had clean forgot her name\nAnd without her fancy make-up she just didn't look the same,\nSo I totally ignored her and she sadly turned away,\nAnd through sympathy I told her she could stay.\n\nOh poor lady, midnight baby,\nNo one wants your love at all,\nOh poor lady, midnight baby,\nNow you're heading for a fall,\nAnd you really think your're something,\nyou know all the things to do\n...\n\n", 
        "(Nicky Chinn / Mike Chapman)\nWho said the web of life is woven in a dream,\n'Cause your life is filled with dreams you can't believe.\nSo the only way you live with it is acting every scene,\nAnd you play the part so well, that you deceive\nNow and again I find you ain't got a friend\nWho knows, I come and I go, but it's your life...\n\n...\n\n", 
        "So you caught a glimpse of someone you once knew,\nAnd it seem to find it hard to face the truth,\nOh, but that don't make it right,\nTo be wantin' me tonight,\nWhen your thoughts on love keep changing all the time.\n\nWell we both knew that there'd be things we'd have to face,\n...\n\n", 
        "Juanita came to me last night, and she cried over and over\nOoh, daddy, i love you, you know, and i think it's the moonlight.\n\nshe looked so fine, well she looked alright, and she moaned\nOoh, daddy, move over\nOh, baby, you know what i like and i think it's the moonlight\n\nmade in mexico, schooled in france, ooh la lovin' she needed no teachin'\nOh man i can say international ways i believe in.\n\nmexican girl, don't leave me alone\n...\n\n", 
        "If you want my sympathy\nJust open your heart to me\nAnd you'll get whatever you'll ever need\nYou think that's too high for you\nOh baby, I would die for you\nWhen there's nothing left\nYou know where I'll be\n\nLay back in the arms of someone\nGive in to the charms of someone\nLay back in the arms of some one you love\nLay back in the arms of someone\nWhen you feel you're a part of someone\nLay back in the arms of someone you love\n\nSo baby just call on me\n...\n\n", 
        "When the night has fallen\nAnd the moon is high\nAnd you get that far away look in your eyes\nOh can't you see you're acting like a stranger\nWhen your loving feelings are so hard to find\nAnd you can deceive me with your made-up lines\nLord knows you sound just like a stranger\n\nSo just in case you've changed your mind\nYou've got love if you want it and it can't go wrong\nAnd just in case you find the time\nYou've got love if you need it and it can't go wrong\n...\n\n"
