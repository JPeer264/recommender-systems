        "God cannot save my soul\nIt's straight to hell for me, I know\nAnd when I get there,\nAt least I've found a place to call my home\nThey say the truth will set you free\nThen why am I still here?\nI've got no truth left, don't you see?\nAm I making myself clear?\n\nResolution, no solution\nGod, If You Are Above...\nI fear that one day the whole world will disappear\nAnd if it does, well, I have lived my life the way that I could!\nThe way that I should!\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "My heart is on fire again\nFrom the depths of Hell, and it swallows me in\nWell, the demons are all in my head\nAnd they're pulling me, pulling me in\n\nHere I go,\nSinking below, sinking below\nAll I know\nIs fading away, fading away from me now\n\nThis can't be happening\nI've watched my whole world fall apart\n\nSo long, farewell, to the best of me\nIt's so far away\n'Cause I'm my own worst enemy\nAnd it's so hard to say,\n\"There's no way out\"\nAnd you are way too late\nSay goodbye to the rest of me\nThe best of me\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Listen up 'cause this is not the end,\nYou're the last thing that crossed my mind.\nRelationships are based on trust,\nWell I guess this one was based on lies,\nBased on lies. Listen up to the ones you trust,\nJust a few by your side.\n(Your side).\nGive in, everythings going to be alright,\n(Here we are, the ones who make time)\nNow it's time for me to go,\nI know, you know, the fights are getting old.\n\nThis is the last chance I have to say to you,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",

        "I was lost, now I'm found\nWas sustained by the sound\nBy the angels singing me to sleep\nNow my feet are leaving the ground.\nAm I dead or am I dreaming instead?\nA cornucopia of opiates are flooding my head.\n\nI'm insane, I am smart\nAll it takes is a spark to ignite my bad intentions\nAnd to what I do best to your heart\nDon't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves.\nNow the moon hates its full, so you know I wont play by the rules.\n\nI will never spill!\nSpill my blood for you.\nYou have let me down\nOne too many times!\n\nSome way, somehow, we're falling out\nCaught in-between my enemies!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
