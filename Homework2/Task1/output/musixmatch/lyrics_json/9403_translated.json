        "I see all shades of you\nMagical mystery gates of time\nI feel all shades of you\nMysticals waters run\nand their not in vain\nnot in vain\nBlessing the newborn moonlight\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Red sun, shine for everyone\nRed sun, rise for everyone\nBlossoming arrays of gold\nRed sphere for outerspace\nBurning wings carressing skin\nMelting in the white dawning clear\nBrush away ashes from dark\n...\n\n", 
        "Black is the colour\nIt's the shade of it all\nThat is the colour\nBetween heaven and earth\n\nBlack is just the colour\nWhen souls within the eyes\nLove\n...\n\n"
