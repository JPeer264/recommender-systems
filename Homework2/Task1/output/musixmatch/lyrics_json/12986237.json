        "When you make it to your driveway\nWill you call to let me know that you're ok?\nAnd when you make it to your bedroom\nDo you collapse on your bed right away?\nOr do you lay and think about how fucking lonely you've become?\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey wait, cough count keep me awake\nLow key, happy and harmless it's so un-alarming\nI can feel it coming out of your AC vents\nAnd it just wears me out, oh it just wears me out\n...\n\n", 
        "Paint cans left out all night in the rain\nFlooding puddles in the storm drains\nAnd if you follow the bay to the Pacific ocean\nAll the kids are playing and the moms are bathing\nAnd the baby brothers all get swept away[?]\n...\n\n", 
        "Take a lover's nap\nShut your little trap\nIt's a pleasure cruise\nWhen you're born to lose\n...\n\n", 
        "Some salty stoned night\nYou cut up your hair bad again\nAnd so you cough up a fake smile\nAnd hate to be photographed skin\n\nNow I'm feeling chumped on the bus\nLeft out of breath out of touch\n...\n\n", 
        "In your new leather jacket you're somebody else\nAnd it's not nice to meet you in a fortress of self\nPack of cigarettes, I empty out\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, what's wrong with me?\nI can't seem to buy it\nI know I'm not good for any girl out there\nShe doesn't get me, I'm just misunderstood\nIt's been days since I last saw her\nIn a brand new dress at the oxygen bar\nWaiting to call her and soon as I call her\nI think I might even drive that far\nTo see her\nWhy are you so mean to me?\nI love you and I hate you\nI miss you, can I forget you?\nYou're a blessing and a curse\nI hope we never marry\n...\n\n", 
        "My holiday heart I don't know where to start\nI could keep you in remission\nOr I could play the part\n...\n\n", 
        "Suddenly I don't believe Its true\nCounting the ways you belong to you\nOh I adore ya\nDoes nothing for ya\n...\n\n", 
        "So lonely\nToo sad to\nTo see you\nNothing next to me\nOh hold me\n...\n\n", 
        "Stretching out cheap cotton over your thick skull\nOh I do feel awful on the way to school\nCan you picture my reaction to the word up on the wall?\nIs there really something wrong with me?\n\nStretching out cheap cotton over your thick skull\n...\n\n", 
        "I would say I'm sorry but I'm not sorry.\nI would say hey what's the difference?\nEntertain my lack of interest.\nBecause the one you are ain't the one that I'm after,\nClosing in on your heart with the worst of intentions.\n...\n\n", 
        "I lost it all in a beach community\nWhere it was lost is not all that clear to me\nOver the sidewalk, into a slow talk\nCall the police\nTold me I'm in the wrong town\n...\n\n", 
        "When you make it to your driveway\nWill you call to let me know that you're ok?\nAnd when you make it to your bedroom\nDo you collapse on your bed right away?\nOr do you lay and think about how fucking lonely you've become?\n...\n\n", 
        "Famous friend, why are you telling lies again?\nAll of your stories start out boring but I'm laughing until I'm crying in the end.\nWe'll see how to cut along the seam.\nSeparate you from the notion that you're something I could never try to be myself,\n...\n\n", 
        "In your new leather jacket you're somebody else\nAnd it's not nice to meet you in a fortress of self\nPack of cigarettes, I empty out\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You're the worst in turn, the first of the night.\nWho could stand there staring at the blacks of your eyes?\nWhat a curious type, reaching out for the iron.\nTo never ask for a slap, but don't indulge in a smile.\nWe're twenty-first dead rats again.\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey wait, cough count keep me awake\nLow key, happy and harmless it's so un-alarming\nI can feel it coming out of your AC vents\nAnd it just wears me out, oh it just wears me out\n...\n\n", 
        "I walked in to find what's worse than worst of all time\nI walked out to see exactly what I expected to see\nYou were there, horrible fingers ran right through your hair\nScabs on everything, stark white flesh\n\nGaining momentum, and hitting its stride\n...\n\n", 
        "I could hear you coming so I hid by the couch.\nYou were talking so loudly, I don't know what about.\nYou were drunker than high school, self-conscious and sweet.\nI never ever felt so cool disguised in your sheets.\n\nBut I'm a constant headache, a tooth out of line.\nThey try to make you regret it, you tell them, no not this time.\nIt's just a constant headache, a dead pet device.\n...\n\n"
