        "One, two, three, four...\n\nLalala lalala la la lalala Oh!\nYou know I never felt like this before\nLalala lalala la la lalala Oh!\nFeels like so real\n\nI'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up\nI'm agressive just one thought of closing up\nYou got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue\n'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you\nI'm the question and you're of course's the answer\nJust hold me close, boy, cause I'm your tiny dancer\nYou make me shaken up, never mistaken\nBut I can't control myself, you got me calling out for help\n\nS. O. S. Please someone help me.\nIt's not healthy for me to feel this\n...\n\n",
