        "Fly yellow moon\nYou put the smile back on my face\nFly yellow moon\nFare you well\nFly yellow moon\nYou give this charmless world some grace\nAnd I don't know how you\nDo all of these things you do\nThey're so brand new\nSo brand new\nOnce I was livid\n...\n\n",

        "There's salt in the air, it's a taste that I know\nAnd the memory of you has started to go\nSometimes we live just to get thrown\nAnd so a cheap train ticket is carrying me back to my home\n\nHigh on the tide\nChasing my demons away completely\nHigh on the tide\nCan in my hand going down so sweetly?\nHigh on the tide\nDon't wake me up and tell me that I'm dreaming\nIt's just how I am\n...\n\n", 
        "When there's storm clouds higher than heaven\nAnd there's angels defeating themselves\nAnd you can't get past half past eleven\nWithout feeding the sharks on the shelf\n\nThen\nFaster than the setting sun we'll run away\nFaster than the setting sun\nFaster than the setting sun we'll run away\n\nWhen you can't sleep for all of these visions\nOf the iridescent lands\nAnd you can't reach a single decision\nWithout your wet face kissing your hands, no\n...\n\n", 
        "There was a crack in your smile the day you were born\nYou're out on the pull and it's making you yawn\nGood samaritans never play their part\nCome round, let me put my hands around your heart\n\nLivewire, your life is in the fire\nYou got everything to play for\n1-1, half time\nLivewire, the world is yours to hire\nWe got everything to live for\nDon't kick it all the time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Firebird, come into me tonight\nStay awake with me through this dark night\nWe can ride 'til the morning light\nOn a bicycle made for two\nOn a bicycle made for two\n\nHush for the baby he's asleep in the hay\nAnd if we should wake him we'll be turned stony gray\nSilence is golden and it's ours today\n...\n\n", 
        "When my days are rolling stones\nWhen my memories ring like telephones\nAnd I'll have somewhere I can go\nI'll have comfort, this one thing I know\n\nYou pull another blanket 'round me\nYeah, you pull another blanket 'round me\n\nThis is where I want to be\nThis is where I want to be\nShe needs me, she needs me\nShe needs me and it's okay\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't be shy\nIt'll get you nowhere\nI was shy\nAnd it got me nowhere\nAnd I feel like turning\nInto a boy again\n\nWhen you're young\nBuckets don't have holes in\nDays are long\n...\n\n", 
        "The boy in the iron mask with wire for brains\nIs firing bows and arrows wherever he thinks it should rain\nYeah, he's drunk too much coffee once again\n\nThis could go in any direction\nAny direction at all\nThis could go in any direction\nAny direction at all\n\nOur memories in the cupboard are getting up and walking\nAnd there's life going on but we're too busy talking\nWhat I am trying to say is that we're losing our way\n\nBut this could go in any direction\nAny direction at all\nThis could go in any direction\n...\n\n",
