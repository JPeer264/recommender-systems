        "He was a southpaw but had a killer right swing\nAn outlaw inside of the ring\nEvery now and then he'd be put against the ropes but then he'd bounce back\nCatch a second wind and throw blows 'til noses crack\nHe smashed mouths, he saw red and blacked out\nReceived a couple pats on the back for the smack downs\nNegative reinforcement, never did he endorse it\nHad the business sense to wait for press conferences to talk shit\nHe wasn't a dullard, though he'd never say much\nProperly mothered but his father taught him how to take a punch\nIt was bare knuckle touch of tough love\nWhen he got drunk enough he took his kid down to the gym and fit him up with gloves\nTied together with a shoelace, took em apart put em on\nLooked in the mirror, practiced his screw face\nSaid, \"This is for you, Pops, for all the things we never got to do\"\nThe hottest part of a flame is blue\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
