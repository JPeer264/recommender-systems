        "You go to my head\nAnd you linger like a haunting refrain\nAnd I find you spinning round in my brain\nLike the bubbles in a glass of champagne\n\nYou go to my head\nLike a sip of sparkling burgundy brew\nAnd I find the very mention of you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Listen to the melody entrancing\nBlending in a soft and sweet refrain\nAs around the floor, dear, we are dancing\nSwaying to a fascinating strain\n\nSweet music soft and mellow\nSoothing and slow\nStrains of a mellow 'cello\nWhen lights are low\nDear, we're so close together I love you so\nWhy think about the weather\nWhen lights are low\nTwo hearts revealing\nMusic hath charms\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
