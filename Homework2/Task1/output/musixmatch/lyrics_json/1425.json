        "Hand me down my favourite coat\nShow what you're made of, surprise us both\nFly in the night, slow down town\nBrake too fast, and bring us round, bring us round\nAnd the finest days have come\nSummer nights go on so long\nSo high I might as well be gone\n\nAnd you are magnificent\nAnd I can see you with my eyes closed\nYou're the last one standing\n\nLean and hungry with a fire in your eyes\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Close your eyes\nGo to sleep\nClose your eyes\nGet so dizzy\nThe world is spinning\nIn your bed\nI know where the sun goes\nIt's waking up the sparrows\nIn England it's morning\n\nIn time, you'll see that some things travel faster than light\nIn time you'll recognise that love is larger than life\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Remember my loose tongue\nForget what I just said\nI'll crawl over broken glass\nIf we could start again\nBefore our plans were made\nWhen the world was young\nThe house was falling down\nBecause of my loose tongue\n\nI shouldn't say so much\nI shouldn't talk so loud\nIt's sooner on your lips\nAnd it's all over town\nIn all our given days\nHow many gone to waste\nA good man has been hung\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Remove yourself from the past\nWherever you are, you don't have to stay\nOld and wise, lion's eyes\nI wish you were here to give me advice\n\nLight-weight dream date\nFly or fall, its my call\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
