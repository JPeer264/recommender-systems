        "I got out of bed today\nSwear to God I couldn't see my face\nI got out of bed today, staring at a ghost\nWho forgot to float away\nDidn't have all that much to say\nWouldn't even tell me his own name\nAnd where'd my body go?\n\nWhere oh where'd my body go?\nAfrica or Mexico?\nOh where'd my body go?\nAnd where'd my body go?\n\nOh have you seen my ghost? Seen my ghost... seen my ghost?\nOh have you seen my ghost? Staring at the ground\nOh have you seen my ghost? Seen my ghost... seen my ghost?\nOh have you seen my ghost? Sick of those goddamn clouds\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
