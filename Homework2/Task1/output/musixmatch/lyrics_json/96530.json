        "I got out of bed today\nSwear to God I couldn't see my face\nI got out of bed today, staring at a ghost\nWho forgot to float away\nDidn't have all that much to say\nWouldn't even tell me his own name\nAnd where'd my body go?\n\nWhere oh where'd my body go?\nAfrica or Mexico?\nOh where'd my body go?\nAnd where'd my body go?\n\nOh have you seen my ghost? Seen my ghost... seen my ghost?\nOh have you seen my ghost? Staring at the ground\nOh have you seen my ghost? Seen my ghost... seen my ghost?\nOh have you seen my ghost? Sick of those goddamn clouds\n...\n\n", 
        "I like long drives\nThe radio is on all night\n'cause you say so\nLying beside\nYour beautiful bones\nWith candlelight\nAnd heaving tones\n\nThis avalanche of love and skin\n...\n\n", 
        "Creeping all night in the heat\nGetting hot under the collar and speaking again\nGive me the runaround\nYoure never gonna bring me down\n\nSleeping all night like a leaf\nYouve got to trust your instincts\nGet a good feel for it\nThey never let you down\n...\n\n", 
        "Hold me like a child\nIn your warm, warm arms\nWhisper parables\nKeep me safe from harm\n\nOh, my sagging skin\nOh, my burning sky\nI will close my eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "I dreamt you were a monster\nWith fiery, fiery eyes\nI dreamt the sun was burning\nBut you just kept on staring\n\nI was afraid of what would happen\n...\n\n", 
        "And even if the words don't sound right,\nI will love you till the day my heart dies,\ntill the day my heart dies.\n\nAnd even if this ain't the right light,\n...\n\n", 
        "Am I made of plastic?\nAm I made of sand?\nAm I made of pieces of a broken hand?\n...\n\n", 
        "Hold me like a child\nIn your warm, warm arms\nWhisper parables\nKeep me safe from harm\n\nOh, my sagging skin\nOh, my burning sky\nI will close my eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "I will not grow tired\nOf crayon stars and fire\nThe sunlight has punctured\nTiny holes of life\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There were floods\nThere was violence\nWords to God\nThere was something\nI'll be calm\n...\n\n", 
        "I dreamt you were a monster\nWith fiery, fiery eyes\nI dreamt the sun was burning\nBut you just kept on staring\n\nI was afraid of what would happen\n...\n\n", 
        "All my friends are skeletons\nDulcimers and chariots\nPrayers to god, oh prayers to god\nHammers for our hollowed heads\n...\n\n", 
        "These broken arms won't hold you down\nThese ruptured lungs won't make a sound\nThese syllables won't bring you back,\nWon't stitch the holes, the bone's in tact\n\nAnd I can't pretend that you were there\n...\n\n", 
        "And even if the words don't sound right,\nI will love you till the day my heart dies,\ntill the day my heart dies.\n\nAnd even if this ain't the right light,\n...\n\n", 
        "we found a cozy nest\n\nwe'll lay our paper heads\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Wrap those feathers like a blanket over me\nThrow my bones into the belly of the deep\nWhisper through my walkie-talkie\n...\n\n", 
        "Am I made of plastic?\nAm I made of sand?\nAm I made of pieces of a broken hand?\n...\n\n",
