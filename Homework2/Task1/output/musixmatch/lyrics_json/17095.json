        "Once I got locked up in a dirty old jail\nAnd the coffee was cold & the cornbread was stale\nAnd I didn't cry. I tried to be brave\nTill the warden tried to give me a haircut & a shave\n\nWarden you can hold me for a year in your jail\nBut don't shave off my beard. Don't cut my ponytail.\n\nAll you really found was some stems & some seeds\nI'll give you my earring & I'll give you my beads\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
