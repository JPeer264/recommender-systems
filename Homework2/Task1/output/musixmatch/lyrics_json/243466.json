        "Tell me who was it told you 'bout the broken bones\nThe broken bones in the sky\n'Cause I've been all over the whole goddamn world\nAnd over the world am I\n\nNow the moon it ain't nothing but an old rotten bone\nHung from the ceiling so high\nIt reminds kids to grow and reminds them to dream\nBut over the world am I\n...\n\n", 
        "The color of your bones it was yellowed by the sun\nAin't no reason why the drummer keeps on drumming on his\ndrum\nOn his drum, we are only for awhile\n\nAnd the truth is like an onion you can skin it layer by layer\n...\n\n", 
        "Down down down down\nThe wicked candle burns to the ground\nDown down down down\nThe wicked candle burns\n\nThe body is stone\nbut the soul is made of cloud\nAnd it has no home but to cry out loud\nWe run and we run\n...\n\n", 
        "Bless your gilded tombstone heart\nWhat's yours is mine\nBless the seams that came apart\nWhat's yours is mine\n\nBless the time that made us grow\nRight out the dragon's fiery door\nBless the toll the monster soars\nWhat's yours is mine and mine is yours\n\n...\n\n", 
        "She left me here with breakfast in bed\nOatmeal with sugar and a hard-boiled egg\nThe note on the dresser said I'll be back by three\nI'm going uptown, did you need anything,\nI'm going uptown, did you need anything?\n...\n\n", 
        "A dying dog can smell the rain\nA weary horse can hide the pain\nWhen the riverbeds dry just hold your tongue\nFolks dig the lies they hang upon\n...\n\n", 
        "I saw a crow, feeding a crow\nA small scrap of metal from a toilet hole\n\nI've seen the birds, circling your big Southern eyes\nWhat could they want, it's no big surprise\n\nI've seen the birds parting your cracked country mouth\nThere's no wonder my love what this is about\n\n...\n\n", 
        "1971, hung up a chicken bone\nOn the old chandelier at the sawdust saloon\nThe medical exam had cleared me to fight\nMy mother said stay and I thought that I might\nMy brother said stay that's when I left\nNever know who might be called in your stead\nSo I showed up on time to meet my platoon\nAnd hung up a bone in the sawdust saloon\n...\n\n",

        "Senorita, with your dust brown skin\nWhere you going with that thing up your sleeve\nI've heard about your ways and I know I cannot win\nSenorita, with your dust brown skin\n\nThere you go again with the devil in your eyes\nYou slide away so softly and so quiet\nI know all your lies, still I think that I might try it\n...\n\n",

        "Set the sails I feel the winds a'stirring\nToward the bright horizon set the way\nCast your wreckless dreams upon our Mayflower\nHaven from the world and her decay\n\nAnd who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin\nFighting for a system built to fail\n...\n\n", 
        "I left Louisiana on the rail line, oo oo\nI left Louisiana on the rail line, oo oo\nI was trying to get to Ohio\nTrying to get to Ohio\n\nLost my love before her time, oo oo\nLost my love before her time, oo oo\nOn the way to Ohio On the way to Ohio\n...\n\n", 
        "The horizon is a beltway that we may never cross\nThe tops of buildings tremble like children lorn and lost\nThe stain runs deep it's deeper than the blood upon the cross.\nThe horizon is a beltway that we may never cross.\n\nYou'll hear that distant love song when the wind blows right\nHear the whistle blowing put a tear into your eye\nYou hear the distant love song but widows know the lie\nThe horizon is a beltway, the skyline is on fire.\n\nThe skyline is on fire, the skyline is on fire\nThe horizon is a beltway and the skyline is on fire\n...\n\n", 
        "by Jack Kerouac and Tom Waits\n\nI left New York in 1949\nTo go across the country without a bad blame dime\nMontana in the cold cold fall\nFound my father in the gambling hall\n\nFather, Father where you been?\nI've been out in the world and I'm only ten\nFather, Father where you been?\nI've been out in the world and I'm only ten\n\nDon't worry about me if I should die of pleurisy\n\nAcross to Mississippi, across to Tennessee\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight's the night when the waters rise\nYou're groping in the dark\nThe ticket takers count the men who can afford the arc\nThe ticket takers will not board\nFor the ticket takers are tied\nFor five and change an hour\nThey will count the passers by\n\nThey say the sky's the limit\nBut the sky's about to fall\n...\n\n", 
        "To them ghosts that write history books\nTo them ghosts that write songs\nEveryone asks would you write one about me\n\nTo them ghosts in the train yard\nAll them ghosts in my drink\nYour money's no good here just write one about me\n\nAnd when you go, where the winds are strong\n...\n\n", 
        "If yor pilot light should die\nDo not quake and do not bark\nYou will find the spark\nIf your tree should bare no fruit\nDo not turn and do not spill\nYou are beautiful\nIf your clarinet should break\nDo not cry a million lakes\n...\n\n", 
        "Throw up your voice but not you mind\nWhile them agents of change go monopolize\nTheir colors and their faces are just shades of the same\nAll lost in the game\n\nAnd we don't need no personal saviors here\nJust a warm hearth and water. It's purely biological\nNo posturing mannequin man or woman\nShall receive my hand\n\nAmong all you angels is a champion angel\nAmong all you devils there's a free soul\nUp from the disenfranchised the engine cries\n...\n\n", 
        "God cage the songbird\nBefore the feathers run brown\nGod bar the windows\nThat we may though hollow be sound\n\nAnd this island shall be shackled to her waters\nHere we vow never to change\nHere we will stand at last for something\nWith no desire to pretend\n\nSend up our prayers to gilded idols\n...\n\n"
