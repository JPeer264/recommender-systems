        "Our dog Bernard lived in the back yard\n'Til one warm summer day.\nOur dog Bernard hit the boulevard;\nHe just up and ran away.\n\nHe left a note taped to the door\n...\n\n", 
        "One day my best friend Barbara turned into a frog\nA hoppin' and a jumpin' on every rock and log\nNow she stays at home all day and all she wants to do\nIs go swimming in the river and in her bathtub, too.\nAnd it's ribitt in the morning, ribitt every night\nRibitt when it's dark outside, ribitt when it's light\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I Need You Like a donut needs a hole\nLike pianos need fingers, heart and soul.\nWe go together like peanuts in a shell,\nI'm gonna hold you in my arms like water in a well.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm a three-toed, triple-eyed, double-jointed dinosaur\nWith warts up and down my back.\nI eat shiny automobiles, tow-trucks and airplanes,\nI love to munch on railroad tracks.\n\nI sleep all day, at night I play,\nSome say I am well read;\nI eat two or three libraries for breakfast\n...\n\n", 
        "Have you ever thought to consider\nWhat it might be like to be\nA black and yellow fuzzy buzzing\nBumblebee like me\nI get migraines, I get headaches,\nI get this buzzing in my ear.\nWatch out you don't sit on me\nAnd I'll watch out for your rear.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "What if a zebra had spots?\nDo you think he would like that a lot?\nAnd what if a tiger had dots\nWhat if a leopard did not?\nWhat if we could sleep like a bat\nAnd dine like an overweight cat?\n...\n\n", 
        "I wanna be a dog, wanna wag my tail,\nChase cars and knock over garbage cans,\nBite the man who brings the mail.\n\nI wanna be a dog, wanna lie on the floor,\nChase squirrels and cats, get fed, get fat,\nChew your shoe and bark at the door.\n\nI wanna be a dog, wanna dig big holes,\n...\n\n", 
        "Once when I was all alone on a mountain by the sea\nI eyed a one eyed cyclops looking straight at me\nHer head was green and hairy. She had a dozen toes.\nHer one eye looked so scary, She had warts upon her nose\nI tried to run away from her, but I was losing ground\nShe was coming faster and faster at me, making a horrible sound\nA SHIGGIE BA GE BA BA BE BE BA A SHE BA BE BA BE BA BAY\nA SHIGGIE BA NAY BA GA NAY BA BE OE DE BA BA BE BA BE BA BE BA BAY\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My brother thinks he's a banana\nBut my mother won't ever admit it.\nHe sleeps curled up in the fruit bowl\nThough Grandma tries to forbid it.\nShe says it isn't normal for him to act that way\nAnd although his complexion has yellowed,\nHe seems to be okay.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If I was a flower growing wild and free\nAll I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee\nAnd if I was a tree growing tall and green\nAll I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves\n\nIf I was a flower growing wild and free\nAll I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee\nAnd if I was a tree growing tall and green\nAll I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves\n\nAll I want is you, will you be my bride?\nTake me by the hand and stand by my side\nAll I want is you, will you stay with me?\nHold me in your arms and sway me like the sea\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Whenever I am naughty, whenever I am bad\nWhenever I do something that makes my parents mad\nLike the time I bit the mailman or left stuff on the floor\nMy parent's say, \"Why can't you be like the boy who lives next door?\"\n\nHe always makes his bed and he always eats his food\nHe likes his itty, bitty sister and he's never ever rude,\nAnd when I don't eat what's on my plate, my parents both will say,\n...\n\n", 
        "Lyrics to I Eat Kids\nI always thought that cows looked prettier in a field\nThan on my plate at supper being served up as the meal.\nAnd though I do like hamburger, fried chicken or a steak,\nI prefer my chickens cackling to fried, cooked or baked.\nI stopped eating animals and I'm glad I finally did;\nBut I get my protein 'cause I eat kids.\n...\n\n", 
        "I Need You Like a donut needs a hole\nLike pianos need fingers, heart and soul.\nWe go together like peanuts in a shell,\nI'm gonna hold you in my arms like water in a well.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Late at night when Mommy and Daddy have gone out,\nMe and my brother get to scream and jump and shout,\n'Cause the house is dark and quiet and we're left all alone\nWith another teen-age baby-sitter talking on the phone.\nWe tip-toe on our tip-toes and we listen to her laugh,\nWhile the water is running, so she thinks we're in the bath.\nShe tells her friend she's hungry, so we know just how to tease her;\nWe go and get the kitty cat and hide it in the freezer.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I think I'm pretty lucky, I'm sure you'll agree,\n'Cause in my house there's a bath tub you see\nAnd in that tub lives a Skatter-Brack Flath\nWho won't let me take a shower or a bath.\nI grab my robe, my soap and towel;\nI hear a shriek and a deep, deep howl.\n...\n\n", 
        "One day my best friend Barbara turned into a frog\nA hoppin' and a jumpin' on every rock and log\nNow she stays at home all day and all she wants to do\nIs go swimming in the river and in her bathtub, too.\nAnd it's ribitt in the morning, ribitt every night\nRibitt when it's dark outside, ribitt when it's light\n\n...\n\n",

        "Just like a rusty pick-up truck that's missing it's front wheel\nWhen you are not beside me, that's just the way I feel\nLike peanut butter without jam -- or peaches without cream\nA whistling tea kettle that's runnin' out of steam\nSome people search for meaning but I see it so clear\nI'm glad to be alive and I am happy with you here\n\n...\n\n",
