        "I wonder if I'll always feel this weak\nWhen I go to the places that we used to be\nI wonder if you check my pictures\non the little phone I got you\nand I know I shouldn't care, there are better things to do\nthan to spend my every moment creepin' up on you\ncreepin' up on you\ncreepin' up on you\ncreepin', creepin', creepin'\nWas it all in my head?\nAll in my head x 2\n...\n\n", 
        "La, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\n\nThe night I laid my eyes on you\nI felt everything around me move\nGot nervous when you looked my way\nBut you knew all the words to say\n\nAnd your love slowly moved right in\nAll this time, oh, my love, where you been\n\nMi Amore, don't you know\nMy love I want you so\nSugar you make my soul complete\nRapture tastes so sweet\n\nI'm mesmerized in every way\n...\n\n", 
        "I never knew a love\nA love that could be sweeter\nNo matter what my mind says\nYour music gives me fever\n\nThe moment that we danced\nYour arms felt like a cradle\nAnd when you took my hand\nI was no longer able\n\nIt never felt so right before\nI need to be with you much more\n...\n\n", 
        "I'd wake up and make love to you if I had you\nI would touch you so much but I'm not allowed to\nWhat I hate is to wait but in this case I'm patient\nI'm discreet, I'm not weak, I just need the moment\n\nHe wants me, he wants me not\nI want everything he's got\n\nIf I leaned over and tried to kiss you\nWould I be wrong after so long to kiss you?\nWould you pretend we're only friends if I kissed you?\nAt least I can dream of you in a scene when I kiss you\n\nOn one hand we are friends\n...\n\n",
