        "Fall into the mists of oblivion.\nDive through the sea of oblivion.\n\nUpon a wish I crawl, upon a will I call to thee\nUpon the might I fall and shall not belong in here\n\nLay your body down, the moon will save your soul.\nFall through the mists of oblivion.\n\nSleep in the mists\nInhale their scent so mystic\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Tormented souls mark her rise.\nFor as they mold through a dark, lonely sigh\nInto a glow\n\nWho\u00b4s not enchanted by the trembling light,\nSelina\u00b4s moon is sending to the earth?\nSee her, walk side by side,\nthe widow leads you into the night.\n\nWho\u00b4s not enchanted by the fateful sound,\nHer voice gets through your innermost part.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "The cosmic maelstroms vast embrace in greed foreshadowed\nIts devouring of doomed existences in sorrow\nForging fires in its gorge through tight attritions heated haze\nTo spew the blazing blown debris\nTo scatter through this timeless space.\n\nDarkest universe lightened up by the golden dawn.\nFrom Sirius, that sends deliverance like seeds it spreads, planted in arcane hearts.\nOf the Dogon, and there the alien gift grew.\nThey felt the embrace by this gloom of the orbit.\nThe spell of life and a tight from Atargatis.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "\"Angels Crying\"\n\nLove, regret, fear and hate,\nAll these emotions never will fade.\n\nHear, they are calling from the other side.\n\"And are wondering, Just who we are, With eyes so full of pride\n\nPain is to bleed as the worn flesh decays\nLife torn apart - the end's on its way\n\nNever let this happen, hear the angels crying!\n\nIn darkest blood, through despair left concealed\nSuffer unfilled dreams out of wounds never healed\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
