Do you understand?\n\nJust give it time, just give it time\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "They say that every day is a struggle and it takes time\nBut do they, do they have a clue?\nHow do I, do I tell the truth from a lie now?\nThey're trying to say hello, it's goodbye tomorrow\nJust put a little weed in the bowl... and you'll be all right!\nYou'll be all right!\n\nJust think if things were perfect\nWould it be worth it if even act all\nSo don't act like you can't take it\nYou were meant to be greatness\nYou can run to the stars\n\nI know how easy, it is to give up\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
