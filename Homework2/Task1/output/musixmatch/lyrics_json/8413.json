        "I feel the shadows on me now\nWith so much more to say\nI see the strange arrival\nFrom a thousand miles away\n\nIf I stopped right where I stand\nAnd believed the lines in my hand\nI would open up my fist\nAnd take the things I'd missed\n\nCome the day\nI will be there when the hammer starts to fall\nCome the day\nI will be there with my reasons for it all\nStruck by sound across my face\nLoud enough that I can taste\nKnock the choices from my head\nHear the voices which just said\n\nCome the day, oh\n\nI weave around the dangers\nThe finest threads unwind\nThis net between my fingers\nCovers all I've left behind\n\nIf I stopped right where I stand\nAnd believed the lines on my hand\nI would open up my heart\nAnd take the hardest part\n\nCome the day\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
