        "There's a place out there for us\nMore than just a prayer or anything you've ever dreamed of\nSo when you feel like giving up, 'cause you don't fit in down here\nFear is crashing in, close your eyes and take my hand, yeah\n\nWe can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe\nIt's written in the stars that shine above\nA world where you and I belong where, faith and love will keep us strong\nExactly who we are is just enough\n\nThere's a place for us\nThere's a place for us\n...\n\n", 
        "Evening, every night you come and you find me\nAnd you always remind me, that my baby's gone\nEvening, you got me deeper in your power\nEvery minute seems just like an hour\nNow that my baby's gone\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Well, you have been kind and I know it seems hopeless\nYou smooth the ground, tear the knots all apart\nYou're helping me move from the inside to the outside\nYou're trying so hard and I can't even start\nIt's a war in there\nIt's a war in there\nAnd you peacemakers go to the same place as soldiers\n...\n\n", 
        "Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars,\nHearing guitars like someone in love.\nSometimes the things I do astound me,\n...\n\n", 
        "Some day, when I'm awfully low,\nWhen the world is cold,\nI will feel a glow just thinking of you\nAnd the way you look tonight.\n\nYes you're lovely, with your smile so warm\nAnd your cheeks so soft,\nThere is nothing for me but to love you,\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll never smile again\nUntil I smile at you\nI'll never laugh again\nWhat good would it do?\nFor tears would fill my eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "Lullaby in rhythm\n\nHere my lullaby in rhythm\nDream your dreams and wonder rhythm\nEvening drowns will come and take you\nThrough the night\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Jeepers creepers, where'd you get those peepers?\nJeepers creepers, where'd you get those eyes?\nGosh, all git up, how'd they get so lit up?\nGosh, all git up, how'd they get that size?\n\n...\n\n"
