        "This is a song.\nThis is a new song.\nThis is through the eyes of one of the greatest people alive I feel.\nThe Lunchlady.\n\nWoke up in the Mornin', put on my new plastic glove.\nServe some reheated salisbury steak, with a little slice of love.\nGot no clue what the chicken pot pie is made of.\nI just know everything is doin' fine down here in... Lunchlady Land.\n\nWell I wear this net on my head, 'cause my red hair is fallin' out.\nI wear these brown orthopeadic shoes, 'cause i got a bad case of the Gout.\nI know you want seconds on the corndogs, but theres no reason to shout.\nEverybody gets enough food down here in... Lunchlady Land.\n\nWell. yesterdays meatloaf is todays sloppy joes.\nAnd my breath wreaks of tuna and there is lots of black hairs comin' out of my nose.\nIn Lunchlady Land your dreams come true, clouds made of carrots and peas.\nMountains built of shepperds pie, and rivers of maccaroni and cheese.\nBut dont forget to return your trays and try to ignore my gum disease.\nNo student can escape the magic of... Lunchlady Land.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
