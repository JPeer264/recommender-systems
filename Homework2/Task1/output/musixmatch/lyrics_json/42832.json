        "I've been waiting for a lifetime\nTo see the skyline fade to gold\nJust been waiting for the right time\nTo let go\n\nAnd I've been looking for a reason why\nWhy we're living within prison walls\nWhen we get to our freedom lies\nInside us\n\nDon't hold me down\n'Cause I'm ready now\nLet's leave this town\nDon't hold me down\n\nYeah we should be fearless\nRemember when we said no regret\nWe should be fearless\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)", 
        "Broken lights\nIn the dark\nAnd the road still seems so far\nHolding hands\nIn the night\nBut the evil takes it all\n\nYou keep holding on\nTo the dreams you got\nBut the air will fade away\nWill you sufficate\nWhen it starts to rain\nAnd you slowly feel the pain\n\nSolid ground\nFalling down\nBreaking all the rules we found\nWill we blow\nWhen we go\nInto a million pieces\nA million pieces\n\nSolid ground\nFalling down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
