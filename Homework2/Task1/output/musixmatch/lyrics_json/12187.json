        "Do you ever feel\nLike a plastic bag\nDrifting through the wind\nWanting to start again\nDo you ever feel\nFeel so paper-thin\nLike a house of cards\nOne blow from caving in\nDo you ever feel\nAlready buried deep\nSix feet under\nScreams but no one seems to hear a thing\nDo you know that there's\nStill a chance for you\n'Cause there's a spark in you\nYou just gotta\nIgnite the light\nAnd let it shine\nJust own the night\nLike the Fourth of July\n'Cause baby, you're a firework\nCome on show them what you're worth\nMake them go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\nAs you shoot across the sky\n...\n\n",
