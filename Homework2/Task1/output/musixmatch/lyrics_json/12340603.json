        "We are not interested in the possibility of defeat.\nNot within the silence of a deserted ally, nor the clamor of a crowded street.\nF.E.A.R. can not be vanquished, we can not be destroyed.\nF.E.A.R. will rise up again and control the masses, take back the power and crush the insurgent hoard.\nAs war fades in to the distant memories of enlightened pigs and open wounds,\nThe Rebels will begin to perish - one by one, they should.\nFeel the fear of dying young, not ignore the chance to scream.\nLie awake at night in terror, admitting F.E.A.R. will return to glory and the story of Rebels who set out to conquer will finish in blood\n\nIn the end as we fade into the night\nWho will tell the story of your life?\n\nIn the end\nAs my soul's laid to rest\nWhat is left of my body\nOr am I just a shell?\nAnd I have fought\nAnd with flesh and blood I commanded an army\nThrough it all\nI have given my heart for a moment of glory\n(I gave it all)\n\nIn the end\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
