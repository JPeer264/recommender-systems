        "I don't even know how I got here\nBut I know that I don't ever wanna leave\nI feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere\nThe bass in pumping and now I believe\nThe light is my bass and I feel the attack now\nThat I'll have a taste now, there's no turning back\nWe are moving as one,\nWe're aligned with the stars\nI know nothing can tear us apart\n\nThere's something ticky over my heart\nThe night is coming out of the dark\nIt's like there's no one else in the room\n'Cause baby all I see is, all I see is you\nPut my hands up to the sky\nLet the music take me\n(All I see)\nAll my senses come alive\nLet the music take me\n(All I see is you)\nPut my hands up to the sky\nLet the music take me\n(All I see)\nAll my senses come alive,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
