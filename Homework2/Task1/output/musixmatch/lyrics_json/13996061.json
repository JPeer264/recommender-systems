        "We are, faces to our lips\nAnd It'll get easier\nWhen you breathe it in\nFall, gently give in\nSwallow in the air\nAnd rain on the skin\n\nHurts will come undone\nAll the will become\nRise and fall behind\nWeightless in rewind\n\nI feel the shifting of you getting closer\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
