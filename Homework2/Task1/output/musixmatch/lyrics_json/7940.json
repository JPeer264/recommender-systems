        "Turn me loose, turn me loose I say\nThis is the first time I have felt this way\nGonna get a thousand kicks or kiss a thousand chicks\nSo turn me loose\n\nTurn me loose, turn me loose I say\nGonna rock 'n' roll long as the band's gonna play\nGonna holler, gonna shout, gonna knock myself right out\nSo turn me loose\n(Turn me loose, ooh, ahh)\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeahhhhhh\n\nI'm cold mama, mama, ma mama now\nI'm cold mama, mama, mama now\n\nAnother Saturday night\nSomebody in a streetfight\nGot shot tonight\n\nIt's hard now\nIt's gettin' harder\nIt's gettin' so hard now\n\nI was lookin' back to see\nIf you were lookin' back at me\nTo see me lookin' back at you\nWhat?!\n\nI was lookin' back to see\nIf you were lookin' back at me\nI saw that you were lookin' too\nOh!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Ooh\n\nHey, kid, rock 'n' roll, rock on\nOoh, my soul\nHey kid, boogie, too, did ya?\nHey, shout, summertime blues\nJump up and down in my blue suede shoes\nHey, kid, rock 'n' roll, rock on\n\nAnd where do we go from here?\nWhich is a way that's clear?\nStill looking for that blue jean baby queen\n...\n\n", 
        "Finger of light reaches through the red curtain\nHigh on the rooftop, greeting [a? is?] Sun\nLieing beside me, secure in your dreamworld\nA glow on your face from the light of the Sun\n\nGently the morning begins its intrusion\nEnters the mind with a hesitant hum\nImages move within eyes not yet open\nTelling the senses a new day has come\n\nAnd the warmth from the light through the window\n...\n\n", 
        "What a dream I had, pressed in organdy\nClothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy\nSofter than the rain.\n\nI wandered empty streets, down past the shop displays\n...\n\n"
