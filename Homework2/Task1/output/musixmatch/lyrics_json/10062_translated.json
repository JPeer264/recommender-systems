        "There's a new world somewhere\nThey call the promised land.\nAnd I'll be there someday\nIf you could hold my hand.\nI still need you there beside me\nNo matter what I do\nFor I know I'll never find another you.\n\nThere is always someone\nFor each of us, they say.\nAnd you'll be my someone\n...\n\n", 
        "Say good-bye. my own true lover,\nas we sing a lover's song.\nHow it breaks my heart to leave you\nnow the carnival is gone.\nHigh above the dawn is waking,\n...\n\n", 
        "How many roads must a man walk down\nBefore he's called a man?\nHow many seas must the white dove sail\nBefore he sleeps in the sand?\nHow many times must the cannon-balls fly\nBefore they're forever banned?\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Listen, all of you people,\nCome and take a few lessons from me,\nGet yourselves prepared for judgement day,\nHallelujah, lujah!\nWhen you hear the trumpet blast\nThen you know you're home at last.\nOpen up them pearly gates for me.\n\n\nChorus:\n...\n\n", 
        "Well I'm on my way to heaven,\nWe shall not be moved.\nOn my way to heaven\nWe shall not be moved,\nJust like a tree that's standing by the water side,\nWe shall not be moved.\n\nChorus:\nWe shall not, we shall not be moved.\nWe shall not, we shall not be moved.\n...\n\n", 
        "As I went a-walkin' on Kilgary Mountain,\nI spied Colonel Pepper, and his money he was countin';\nI rattled out my pistols and I drew forth my saber,\nCryin', \"Stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver.\"\nChorus:\nMusha rig um du rum da,\nWhack fol the daddy o,\nWhack fol the daddy o,\nThere's whisky in the jar.\n...\n\n", 
        "They gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,\nSayin' \"Steve, you're way behind time;\nIt's 8: 38, and it's the Old '97;\nGotta put her into Danville on time.\"\nChorus:\nWell, it's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg down to Danville,\nOn a line with a three-mile grade;\nIt was down that line where he lost his air-brakes;\nYou can see what a jump he made.\nSteve Brady he said to his black, greasy fireman,\n\"Shovel on a little more coal;\nI'm waitin' to pass them wide-open mountains;\nGonna see the Old '97 roll.\"\n\nHe's comin' down that line makin' ninety miles an hour;\nThe whistle broke into a scream;\nThey found him in the wreck with his hand upon the throttle;\nHe'd been scalded to death by steam.\n...\n\n", 
        "Train whistle blowing makes a sleepy noise\nUnderneath their blankets go all the girls and boys\n\nRocking rolling riding out along the bay\nAll bound for Morningtown many miles away\n\nDriver at the engine fireman rings the bell\nSand man swings the lantern to show that all is well\n...\n\n", 
        "Slow down, you move too fast. \nYou got to make the mornin' last. \nJust kickin' down the cobbletones, \nLookin' for fun and feelin' groovy. \nBa da da da da da da, feelin' groovy. \n...\n\n", 
        "Well well well who's that a calling\nWell well well hold my hand\nWell well well night is a falling\nSpirit is a-moving all over this land\n\nGod told Noah build him an ark\nBuild it out of hickory bark\nRain started falling waters start to climb\nGod said a fire not a flood next time\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I wandered the streets and the gay crowded places\ntrying to forget you but somehow it seems\nmy thoughts ever stray to our last sweet embraces\nover the sea on the island of dreams\nHigh in the sky is the bird on the wing\nplease carry me with you\n...\n\n", 
        "I should have known\nYou'd bid me farewell\nThere's a lesson to be learned from this\nAnd I learned it very well\nNow I know you're not the only starfish in the sea\nIf I never hear your name again\nIt's all the same to me\nAnd I think,\nIt's gonna be alright\nYeah,\nThe worst is over now\nThe mornin' sun is shining\nLike a red rubber ball\n\nYou never care\nFor secrets I confide\nFor you I'm just an ornament\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday\nAll my troubles seemed so far away\nNow it seems as though they're here to stay\nOh I believe in yesterday\n\nSuddenly\nI'm not half the man I used to be\nThere's a shadow hanging over me\nOh yesterday came suddenly\n\nWhy she had to go, I don't know\n...\n\n", 
        "Chorus:\nTo everything, turn, turn, turn,\nThere is a season, turn, turn, turn,\nAnd a time for every purpose under heaven.\n\nA time to be born, a time to die,\nA time to plant, a time to reap,\nA time to kill, a time to heal,\nA time to laugh, a time to weep.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Come gather 'round people wherever you roam\nAdmit that the waters around you have grown\nAccept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone\nIf your time to you is worth savin'\nThen you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone\nFor the times they are a-changin'\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, yeh! Cajun man, do all he can,\nGotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man.\nAt birth, Mama 'n' Papa called their little boy Ned;\nRaised him on the banks of the river bed.\nA houseboat tied to a big, tall tree,\nA home for my mama and my papa and me.\nThe clock strikes three, Papa jumps to his feet;\nAlready Mama's cookin' Papa somethin' to eat.\nAt half-past, Papa, he's a-ready to go;\nHe jumps in his bureau headed down the bayou.\nChorus:\nHe's got a fishin' line strung across a Louisiana river,\n...\n\n"
