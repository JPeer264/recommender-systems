        "So many people turn me one way\nSo many people turn me to stay\nNever time to have my mind meet up\nCaught in a motion and I don't wanna stop\n\nSo many people turn me one way\nSo many people turn me to stay\nNever time to have my mind meet up\n...\n\n", 
        "So you no longer care if there's another day\nI guess I have been there, I guess I am there now\nYou knew what you wanted and you fought so hard\nJust to find yourself sitting in a golden cage\nIn a golden cage\n...\n\n", 
        "You keep your cards so close to your chest\nYou're making me confused\n\nIt's hidden deep what you need to address\nIf you want it to resume\n\nAching and longing never ending fireworks\n...\n\n",

        "Give me a reason to stay constantly ignored\nGive me an angle that I haven't tried before\nA guarantee for being honestly compared\nYou want to live when life is achingly unfair\n\nDon't make a move you'll look ridiculous again\nYou share no interest but it's easy to pretend\nDon't start the action it will turn against you soon\n...\n\n", 
        "In the battle for belonging\nEvery doorbell has its code\nWith a stare it can be opened\nNow you have it now you don't\n\nThere are buildings there are people\nWalk around and look up to\nEvery swallow has its season\nEvery gallow has its noon\n\nBy the rythm of your language\nBy the sparkle in your stride\nTalk in riddles or be candid\nWith a shield or open wide\n...\n\n", 
        "Painless\nSo easy\nYou come fast\nAnd leave me\n\nHalf a life\n...\n\n", 
        "There comes a time\nFor everyone\nTo sit down and assess what's there and what is not there\nEternally up in the air\n\nAnd it seems that time has come for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you stop talking,\nBecause I don't think we agree,\nYou're always keeping all your borders up,\nI'm thinking something must be wrong with me,\nWell i know you don't like it,\nYou're no exclusive company,\nYou're always keeping all your borders up,\nAnd it's a little more than you and me.\n\nWell somebodies had a harder time,\nBut your always on the attack,\nHave they been giving you the run-around,\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm so happy you called\nI really needed a break\nFrom all the people I see\nAll the people I spend time with\n\nWhere did my summer go\nThe week that was canceled\n...\n\n",
