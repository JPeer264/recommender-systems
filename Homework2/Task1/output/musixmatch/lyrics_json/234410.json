        "It's late at night and the world's asleep, I'm trying not to think.\nI take some pills cuz my mind bleeds, I'm thinking what is wrong with me?\nBecause the only thing I know about honesty is every lie I've told that you believed.\nI'm afraid to be alone. I'm afraid that one day you'll find out.\n\nAnd you'll be amazed at the secrets I keep.\nYou'd be amazed at my mouth full of lies.\nBut I'm too afraid to come clean\ncuz my life's the flame in a house of cards.\n\nNow I can't look you in your eyes because the guilt is killing me.\n...\n\n", 
        "Tonight is all over,\nBut we're all still wide awake.\nHuddled together,\nJust hoping this moment won't fade away.\nThe sunlight makes it's way up the field toward us again,\nMarking the end of this.\n\nBecause everyone's going their separate ways,\nSometimes things just change.\nBut we'll never forget who we were that day,\nSo don't be afraid,\n'Cause we'll be okay.\n\nCarved out our love,\nAnd we all broke our hearts together.\nThese are the times that define who we are forever.\n...\n\n",

        "She looked at me her eyes were watering\nThen I knew that this was about to end\nFrozen in that moment, time was standing still\nI could feel my heart, sinking fragile\n\nGood bye, She said\nI went and found somebody new\n\nAnd I gave you every waking moment\nI gave you everything you wanted\nAnd now, I know your giving me up\n\nShe walked away and I could hardly breathe\nTurn around and fell down to my knees\nShivering as the truth is settling\nHer tomorrow has nothing to do with me\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes I try not to hate myself\nFor everything I never said\nWhen you were here\nAnd so I'm burning up photographs\nOf what was a perfect past\n'Cause I'm still here\nBut I'm barely holding on\n\nWhere did I go wrong\nChoking on the difference\nBetween me and the world\nAnd ever since you've been gone\nI've been torn apart\nI know that you can't hear me but\nI'm still hurt\nAnd I wish you were here\n\nIt's so hard that I try to bury it\nPretend that you didn't exist\nSo I can be strong\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm frozen as my life is bursting into flames from deep within\nI panic, worrying about the future\nthen the past begins to chase me down\nBut this time you're the only one around\nAnd I'm staring at a photograph\nfrom before I was sick and addicted to you\nit was a perfect life\nwhatever happened to me?\n\nI can't get out of my way\nAgain and again\ncause I'm addicted to you\nAgain and again\nBecause I'm dead without you\nHow will I live through today?\n\nI'm standing at the edge of my life again\n...\n\n",
