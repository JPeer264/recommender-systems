        "Have you got colour in your cheeks?\nDo you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide that sticks around like summat's\nin your teeth?\nHide some aces up your sleeve\nHave you no idea that you're in deep?\nI dreamt about you nearly every night this week\nHow many secrets can you keep?\nCause there's this tune I've found that makes me think of you somehow\nAnd I play it on repeat until I fall asleep\n\nSpilling drinks on my settee\n(Do I wanna know?)\nIf this feeling flows both ways\n(It's hard to see you go)\nI'm sorta hoping that you'd stay\n(Baby we both know)\n\nThat the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day\nCrawling back to you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone\nBoy with a broken soul\nHeart with a gaping hole\nDark twisted fantasy turned to reality\n\nKissing death and losing my breath\nMidnight hours cobble street passages\nForgotten savages, forgotten savages\n\nDig up her bones but leave the soul alone\nLet her find a way to a better place\nBroken dreams and silent screams\nEmpty churches with soulless curses\n\nWe found a way to escape the day\nDig up her bones but leave the soul alone\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Didn't know what this would be\nBut I knew I didn't see\nWhat you thought\nYou saw in me\n\nI jumped the gun\nSo sure you'd split and run\nReady for the worst\nBefore the damage was done\n\nThe storm never came\nOr it never was\nDidn't know getting lost in the blue\nIt meant I wound up losing you\n\nWelcome to the inner workings of my mind\nSo dark and foul I can't disguise\nCan't disguise\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "This world is gonna burn, burn burn burn\nAs long as we're going down\nBaby you should stick around\nBaby you should stick around\n\nIt's all gon't to shit, it's out of our hands\nBabe if you could know, you would hatch a plan\nThat's my, that's my man\n\nIf we're gonna die, bury us alive\nIf they're searching for us they'll find us side by side\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
