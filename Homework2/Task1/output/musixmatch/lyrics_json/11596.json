        "My dream girl don't exist\nAt the age of five she slit her wrist\nShe didn't know that I'd be hanging around\nSo her parents buried her in the ground\nAnd this day I can still hear the sound\nOf a life in outerspace\n\nMy dream girl don't exist\nJust you and I and this TV\nAnd this illness seems to feel so strange\nLike a henchman that's about to hang\nThe moon up like a ball and chain\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",

        "Sinking ship-\nHow long can you hold still?\nYour illness spills against my face\nSinking ship-\nHow long can you hold still?\nOh, can't you feel the coming waves?\nA perfect Sunday portrait of my mother painting horses all alone\nOf lovers and of leaves still believing they are free to come and go\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
