        "Take to the highway won't you lend me your name\nYour way and my way seem to be one and the same\n\nMamma don't understand it\nShe wants to know where I've been\nI'd have to be some kind of natural born fool\nTo want to pass that way again\nBut I could feel it\nOn a country road\n\nSail on home to Jesus won't you good girls and boys\nI'm all in pieces, you can have your own choice\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone\nSuzanne the plans they made put an end to you\nI walked out this morning and I wrote down this song\nI just can't remember who to send it to\n\nI've seen fire and I've seen rain\nI've seen sunny days that I thought would never end\nI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend\nBut I always thought that I'd see you again\n\nWon't you look down upon me, Jesus\nYou've got to help me make a stand\nYou've just got to see me through another day\nMy body's aching and my time is at hand\nI won't make it any other way\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range,\nHis horse and his cattle are his only companions.\nHe works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons,\nWaiting for summer, his pastures to change.\nAnd as the moon rises he sits by his fire,\nThinking about women and glasses of beer,\nAnd closing his eyes as the doggies retire.\nHe sings out a song which is soft but it's clear,\nAs if maybe someone could hear.\nHe says\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "There's something in the way she moves,\nOr looks my way, or calls my name,\nThat seems to leave this troubled world behind.\nAnd if I'm feeling down and blue,\nOr troubled by some foolish game,\nShe always seems to make me change my mind.\n\nAnd I feel fine anytime she's around me now,\nShe's around me now\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "In my mind I'm gone to Carolina\nCan't you see the sunshine?\nCan't you just feel the moonshine?\nAnd, ain't it just like a friend of mine\nTo hit me from behind?\nYes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind\n\nKarin, she's a silver sun\nYou best walk her way and watch it shine\nAnd watch her watch the morning come\nA silver tear appearing now\nI'm cryin', ain't I?\nGone to Carolina in my mind\n\nThere ain't no doubt in no ones mind\nThat love's the finest thing around\nWhisper something soft and kind\nAnd hey babe, the sky's on fire\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
