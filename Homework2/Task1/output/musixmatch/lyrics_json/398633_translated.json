        "Awoke with a vicious grin in the phallus entrance, hard from the mother's cries. Your infants hands are gripping flesh. Dying sweating storms, writhing on a gurney, dreams of pleasure burning off in sheets. No time to sedate. This harlot must be seen at once. Protrusions rising from the skin underneath her gut are wearing thin. Now as your belly is split apart a voice begins to whisper,\n\n\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Lo, here I've fallen with my claws deep in your back.\nAnd with a surly swing, I'll collapse your neck.\nI've waded through barren nights, procuring latent sins, without overwhelming myself in such shallow standards.\nLust in patience is beginning to hollow my very core.\nThrough the thick of the trees I can sense her emotional aura.\nEnvisioning the waltzing daughter gliding with vacancy.\nConsequently this embellishes a feeling I've held in seclusion for an eternal perpetuity.\n\n[Lead: Funderburk]\n...\n\n", 
        "Here at the break of dawn\nI wait secluded from occurrences\nThat stand foretold\nHesitation devastates me\nWhile the reek of you empowers me\nTo defy my immortal humanity\nSo set in stone with these rulings\nI can't deceive my father's regulations\nNo matter what the lure\nI must hold back my strength\n...\n\n", 
        "Shaking hands with his left.\nGiving you his filthy ring to lay your courageous virgin lips upon.\nFeeling so unworthy in this holy matrimony between a brother and a sister.\nCaligula said, \"Drusilla, we will bring on the fall of this Roman empire.\"\nCaligula and Drusilla conceived a child upon this erection forced by Zeus to bring a destined dawn.\nI will guide my hands inside, to desecrate your uterine walls.\n...\n\n", 
        "All of the elements are filled with black\nConsuming my body\nMy preceding visions fade to white\nAnd that's when I hear shrieks\n\nI smell fire engulfing all of those slain before me\nWith their souls slashed apart\nThe weaker discarded, towering above\nI feel their feet brush my hair\n\nVirgins grinning slightly as they crawl\nAcross the molten fields dripping with sweat\nBringing rotting phallus's near\nHere to satiate you as you're hemorrhaging\n\nSet forth almighty futures\n...\n\n", 
        "Swept myself away, from the troublesome future I have bestowed upon you.\nCast myself away, from the grips of your demise.\nWaiting impatiently for this insufferable pain to subside.\nAs I walk these barren lands to hide my insecurities, I confide in nothing.\nThe nourishment won't take me far away from the constant memoirs of you.\nWaiting impatiently, for this unbearable thirst to subside.\nRipping through the branches as I sink my teeth into flesh.\n...\n\n", 
        "Surfacing from the foul abysmal depths, be at rest assured she will sing to the world in a sweetened harmony, without a falter in her means.\nAs I bear witness to the flood that's justly pouring from her shawl, I know that soon we will swoon in the wrap of her staggering grace just simply melting from her breath.\nShe is poisoning us with regret for feeling comfort instead of dread.\nShe has got the lead and she sees it, lifting her arms.\nAnd just as we turn our backs to flee, wretches tail her out of the sea.\nCoiling the running that shapes the flood, where the burdened visions take our hands the blood will fall.\n\n[Solo: Funderburk]\n\n...\n\n", 
        "As I stand on the edge of the rising tide I am overcome with beauty.\nThere is a fleeting feeling that takes my legs to fill my lungs with all of the world.\nGulp by gulp the serpent dreams, to decimate my burning wings.\nOh how he effectively detaches my burning wings with a faulty sense of valor.\nLust in the molten soul, here in hell where the visions sing and the streets are paved in coal, I will see you through your feats.\nI will save you, a prodigy that's feeding.\n...\n\n", 
        "Father's room is dark. In precious time our hearts will be alright. This floor is cold. And I'm afraid I am not afraid of conjuring her, back from the grave. Whose are these voices quickly approaching me? \"Your sacrifice is not sufficient. We'll need plenty more before you set your sights to her.\" Wires are crawling out, struggling at my leg. I hear my brother scream as he is consumed like a burning tree. Not again. Confiscate my arms, my heart. I must reclaim his soul at least! This sudden dream is a distraction. A backwards creature writhed in guts, in puss, in a mass of putrid flesh from which it cannot escape. Locking eyes with eyes as bright as the sun, reflecting off of clouds on such a beautiful day. If only this could be illusive. Frozen by the loss of blood, dragging myself to steel. Inching myself to this familiar body. Painting a seal on this familiar body. All's black.\n\n[Solo: Funderburk]\n...\n\n", 
        "I am Elturiel, called beyond the gate to serve. Sylvester Al\u00e9doe is nothing but a shell. Sylvester Al\u00e9doe has conjured me to protect him through a chasm.\n\n[Solo: Vail]\n\nOne thousand years of lethargy botched by one's personal misfortune.\n...\n\n", 
        "I breeze as but a spirit uninterrupted, to consent with the Hallifalations Behrathas, Aehnkantos. \"I stand before you a fleshless temple from Xzorian with the last talisman, capable of the destruction of Uraitahn. You are more than familiar with our compromise. I've taken apart myself to suit you, now just bring me to my eyes.\" \"Give us the talisman! We've transferred more than you deserve. Eternal life to a doltish man is nothing we've been known to do.\" The seal inside this marionette has quickly come to wither. My last chance at mortality is to devastate these poisoned lands. \"Ohrelae untai, ohrelae.\" The haze within their eyes begins to solidify. Light attempts to breach the sky. The steaming ground begins to break like a thirsting mouth to swallow up their lives.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Splintering blistered fingers. Chalk smears cake my body white. Sweat perspiring down my face. Retracing lines to tighten this seal. Clandestinely twining with devilry coursing through the night. My wicked enchantments hurl my body as it's careening through dust. Through dust and light I feel I've made it. As my heart climbs through my ribs it tells me so; the specter shows me so. The darkness surrounding is growing as the specter sheds to begin anew. Within it's body they are glowing on through her. Their faces shine fiercely with such deep sinew. This crooked mystery envelops all space around me as the many faces speak as one. \"Why have you come here; what has brought you through? Why have you come here; what has brought you through to my domain!\" My body falters. I feel myself begin to crumble as rickety noises force themselves from my throat. I begin to form some sense into an explanation. \"I need to see this, to feel this, to breathe! To see, to feel, to breathe in your miasma.\" \"Take refuge in the carcass my darkening soul. Albeit by the force of beauty incarnate, do not release yourself into this world. Here your essence is soluble.\"\n...\n\n",

        "My transience slept cold, waiting for the gate to open, to release my father; to release my carrion*\nI've fled across lands of ice and fire, in a striving search for the cryptic scriptures that will restore my soul to it's flesh and bone.\nLong have I waited to meet your eyes; to delve inside; to steal through your mind; to utilize the plans inside.\nThese pages are false.\nWhere is the remembrance of the city that's fallen; the millions of lives given into the creation of this?\n[Solo: ~Vail~]\n...\n\n", 
        "In a distant realm where body and soul divide:*\n\"We are the Hallifalacious, the guardians of this whole. In this realm where mortality capitulates, we'll feed for eons upon your temple.\"\nBehrathas, Aehnkantos, cease to deplete from this consumption.\nWelcoming in all thriving flesh.\n...\n\n", 
        "The dawn has come to put your queries aside, I see doom\nin the skeptical minds, Sucked into this world, of imminent\ngrowth, That's soon to expand till the dead line the coast,\n\nIt seems to me...\n\nWe're fearing God's wrath when it, Is our own, No horse-men, just\nour species, to lay waste to our homes A civil death, a chivalry\nwar, Panic like the vermin you bank with, It ends in a thought, not a bang.\n\n[Lead: Vail]\n\nIt'll happen one day coming, not in ways that you'll conceive, Not\n...\n\n", 
        "Agony drags on so sluggish. The winters long and my bones won't Accept the\ncheck.

        "My god was formed in the\nsouth with a smile, And\nanger pent up till pearls\nbrighten the sky, I need you,\nbut when it's turned,\nI am sparse, Worthless, selfish\nand sick for a start.\n\nI stole for my high and let\nthe revulsion rot inside...\nCarving through my brain with an attentive pen,\nI stop myself from fixing things.\n\nWill it be the cane that\n...\n\n", 
        "I rise from what was slumber, To a world much worse to fear\nThe digital ash is blasting back at me\n\nMy gun still waits impatient, with two shells to my name,\nAn army is forming, the neighbors conforming.\n\nTo spill blood in God's name, to devise a strategy,\nTo make medicated slaves in love with their own ways.\nAnd this will bring us doom, you've known this as a truth\nit hurts but your too drunk to see these signals.\n\nRepeat, the end is never near, It's just at its morning silence.\nRepent and I beg to those who never answer me...\n...\n\n", 
        "I can see that you're not ready for this. But I've waited for\nchaos since childhood my friend. And my life has all been a miss.\nWhat happens when things just keep going?\n\nWhen the tides all subside & the fire is weak,\nAnd the world still exists in American bliss,\nIt's time to let go.

        "My intestines tangled, I'm tempted to rip them out\nThrow them at my doctor, Sick with pick one,\ncrones or karma. Crones or karma\n\nGod I am imperfect, and it's your stubborn fault,\nYour arrogant boast, your highly priced Heaven,\nMy stomach hanging out, Feel the tendons pop,\nThe relief is coming\n\nI did this myself, I had no savior, I am responsible\n\n...\n\n"
