        "As the reasons came and went, and swept across\nThe face of my innocence, I was lost.\n\nTo know your face, and your true shade\nTo feel your lips, and to be bade\nTo praise the night, to praise my unknown faith\nMust I sure find a way? To infest the wound\n\nInside the wound, that draws me near\nAnd cries my name, and feeds my presence\nI am here!\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)",
