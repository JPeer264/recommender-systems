        "We're smashing mics in karaoke bars\nYou're running late with half your make-up on\nThis method acting might pay our bills\nBut soon enough there'll be a different role to fill\nI love this feeling\nBut I hate this part\nI wanted this to work so much\nI drew up our plans on a chart\nCars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit\nMy character's strong but my head is loose\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)", 
        "I've just had the craziest week\nLike a party bag of lies\nBooze and then deceit\nAnd I don't know why\nI want to voice this out loud\nIt's therapeutic somehow\n\nSo I'm moving to New York\n'Cos I've got problems with my sleep\nAnd we're not the same\nAnd I will wear that on my sleeve\nSo I'm moving to New York\n'Cos I've got issues with my sleep\nLooks like Christmas came early\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "She works downtown in an unmarked bar,\nFlyin' round poles she always gave me the fright of my life\nI didn't mean to get involved it was the alcohol\nMixed with and empty feeling inside\nIts such a bad idea to fall in love with a 'lady of the night'\n\nWhy didn't God give her two left feet\nThen she couldn't run away from me!\n\nMonths go by and I'm alone in bed\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
