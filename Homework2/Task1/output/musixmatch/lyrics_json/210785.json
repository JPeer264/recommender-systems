        "Well it's a big big city and it's always the same\nCan never be too pretty tell me your name\nIs it out of line if I were simply bold to say \"Would you be mine\"?\n\nBecause I may be a beggar and you maybe the queen\nI know I maybe on a downer am still ready to dream\nNow it's 3 o'clock time it takes for you to talk\n\nSo if you're lonely why'd you say your not lonely\nOh your a silly girl, I know I hurt it so\nIt's just like you to come\nAnd go you know me no you don't even know me\n...\n\n",

        "She said \"I'm Rosie\"\nI said \"I thought you were Lucy\"\nShe said \"No Rosie, I told you so\"\nWas here with your sister\nBut she's going out the back\nI wanna dance and have fun y'know\nOf all the shitty little places I meet you it's here\nAnd I'm freaking out\nI heard you got a brand new name\nSelling Es in the dark\nBut hey it's nothing to shout about\n\nDon't just say yes to tease me\nDo your upmost to please me\nI don't mean to be sleazy\nBeing you can't be easy\n\nWhen you're creepin' up the backstairs\nMother's nightmares\nFalling in the front door\nMy my\nClimbing in the window\nGet dressed, let's go\nTake your brother's car keys\n...\n\n",
