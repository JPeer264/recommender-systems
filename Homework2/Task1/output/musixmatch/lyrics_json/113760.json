        "You set the fire in me C-C\nIt's like I've learnt how to breathe easily\nPhotographed for a fashion magazine\nIt's just you, your God and me\n\nI know it can't be easy for you\n\nYou set the fire in me C-C, you set the fire in me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Last night, I had a dream about everybody here\nYou were all wearing smart red tops in the opening scene\nLooking at me kinda strange 'cos I was wearing old jeans\nTalking to each other, the cigarettes you smoke have no smoke to blow\n\n(At me)\nA little word in your ear\n(At me)\nA little word in your ear, girl\n\n(At me)\nA little word in your ear\n(At me)\nA little word in your ear, girl\n\nYou've got the days mixed up in your diary\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "There is still so much to see\nThere is still so much to do\nI can't be more than half way through\nI know I'm wasting precious time\nBut I'll take it in my stride\nI've got a lot of things to put right\n\nDon't get upset\nIt's not my time yet\nI ain't saying my goodbyes\nDon't get upset\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
