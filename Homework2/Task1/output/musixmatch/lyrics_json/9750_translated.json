        "We all know what we have done\nWent completely wrong\nWe closed our eyes to all\nThe misery we spread\nWe're killing each other\nHumanity is dead\n\nSave us, save us from the evil\n...\n\n", 
        "This is the time - I break your bones.\nThis is the time - I crush your head.\nThis is my time. This is my time.\n\nThis is the time - You feel the fear.\n...\n\n", 
        "Candlelights are burning, you listen to my voice.\nI know you are virgin, you know you got no choice.\nThis is the night we dreamt of,\nI wan't to take through the door of your desire.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You lay on your bed this night\nYour eyes stir on the wall\nThere's no one beside you anymore\nAnd you feel so alone\n\nThe candle burns in your room\nRain keeps falling on your past\nNo hope for a better life\n...\n\n",

        "I met you in the darkness, you shivered and you cried...\nYou looked so pretty, with tears in your eyes\n\nYou tried to touch my hand, I carried you away\nI thought that I could hold you, but you left me all alone\n\nI met you in the darkness, you shivered and you cried...\nYou looked so pretty, with tears in your eyes\n\nYou tried to touch my hand, I carried you away\nI thought that I could hold you, but you left me all alone\n...\n\n", 
        "Let me touch your skin\nLet me see your eyes\n\nYou will taste this sweet pain\nYou will like to suffer for me\n\nSee the light in my eyes\nFeel the razorblades on your skin\n\nSee your sparking blood\nLet me drink your life\n\nAnd in my world of temptation\nI will wait for you\n...\n\n"
