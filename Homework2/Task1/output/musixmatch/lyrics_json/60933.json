        "[Spoken]\nWe held hands on the last night on earth.\nOur mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees,\nscreaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves.\nIt was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated\nalong the bottom of the river.\nSo we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea\nand the shattered seasons lay,\nand the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease.\nIn our cancer of passion you said, \"Death is a midnight runner.\"\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233194)"
