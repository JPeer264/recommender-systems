        "I'm so sorry\nPlease forgive me\nFor knowing that I'm wrong but insisting I'm right\nFor wanting everything to be either black or white\nFor wallowing in self-pity, confessing all my sins\nFor studying my thoughts till my head caves in\nFor all the things I've said but regret so much now\nFor all the things I should have said but I couldn't somehow\nFor all the times I've meant them\nAnd I've known them for so long\nBut I still get endings wrong\n\nI'm so sorry\nPlease forgive me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
