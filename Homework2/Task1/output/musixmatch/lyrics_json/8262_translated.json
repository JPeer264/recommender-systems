        "In each others arms\nWe cried together\nAnd your tears tasted sweet\n\nAll is not lost\nAnd never to be forgotten\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The way the willow leans over the brook Like a person who goes crying for the lover. ...", 
        "All tears restrained for years\nTheir grief is confined\nWhich destroys my mind\n\nAn ode to their plight is this dirge\n...\n\n", 
        "And I often sigh\nI often wonder why\nI'm still here and I still cry\n\nAnd I often cry\nI often spill a tear\nOver those not here\nBut still they are so dear\n...\n\n", 
        "It is not I who sleeps\n...\n\n", 
        "With loving passion, oh your radiance\nA serenade I cry\nYour silk lined coffin the lachrymatory\nTo hold a mourner's tears\n\nEthereal splendor\nPale skin and down cast eyes\nScent of paradise\nLike her, forever remains unknown\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There is a whole mountain\nAnd a river runs through it\nIf you split my mountain wide\nYou would find many rivers\n\nAmong flocks of non-white doves\nAnd non-temptable mortals\n...\n\n", 
        "Be smothered in life\nListen, listen, listen\nThe written word will devour you\nAnd burn your mind\nI'm burning your mind\nI am entering your soul\nMy promise to love and caress you\nMirrors destiny and breathes the universe\n\n...\n\n", 
        "My life's minds plagued by lyssophobia\nIn a cage solitude locks me in\nAs the dar blackened walls close in on me\nDementia strikes, there's no turning back\n\nDrowning in the stygian sea\nAs those voices repeat to me my malediction\nMemento Mori\nRemember you must die\n\nA gratuitous wraith of violence\nBlots out the light of my mind\n...\n\n", 
        "Stately columns standing in solemn rows\nSuch empty honours are suitable for those\nWhose death erases all renown and fame\nAnd vanquishes their glory with their name\n\nWandering aimlessly through dead filled fields\nRewards are just, who knows what absence yields?\n\nBy the golden beauty of dusk\nand the sun low in our sky\nBy the haunting shadows of trees\n...\n\n", 
        "As a shadow is cast overhead\nI rejoice in the coming of the gloom\nLifting my eyes to view what, to me, is beauty\nI decipher what is read in the cloud\nThe verse is shouting out and ringing in my ears\nThe claps of thunder, scared? No, me I revere\nin the enchantment of mother nature\nHer caress it soothes and brings me joy\n...\n\n", 
        "Somniferous whisperings of scarlet fields\n...\n\n", 
        "I cry a tear of hate but it is lost in helplessness.\nThe darkness eats away at the very embers of my soul\nFor the deepest love I have has dissolved before my eyes.\nMy sorrow is bleak, I beg for deliverance.\n\nLord, in your mercy, hear my prayer.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "All tears, restrained for years\nTheir grief is confined\nWhich destroys my mind\n\n...\n\n",
