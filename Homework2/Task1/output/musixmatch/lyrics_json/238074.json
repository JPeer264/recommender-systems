        "Have you seen that girl\nHave you seen her?\nShe's the freakiest thing\nYou gotta need her\nYou'll do whatever it takes to get her by your side\n\nIt's not the way she smiles\nWith a little laugh\nIt's not the way she looks\nIn a photograph\nBut all the boys, they crowd around\n\nShe can't sing\nShe can't dance\nBut who cares\nShe walks like Rihanna\n\nShe can't sing\nShe can't dance\nBut who cares\nShe walks like Rihanna\n\nHave you seen that girl\nHave you seen her\nWith the way she moves you wanna kiss her\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
