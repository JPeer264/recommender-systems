        "Well I saw you with your hands above your head\nSpinning around, trying not to look down\nBut you did, and you fell, hard on the ground\nThen you stumbled around for a good ten minutes\nAnd I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before\nAnd you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though\n\nYou're the only one who\nDrags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams\nYou're the only one who\nKnows exactly what I mean\n\nAnd I probably forgot to tell you this\nLike that time I forgot to tell you about the scar\nRemember how uncomfortable that made you feel?\nSee you're not what I expected\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",

        "The rain falls on your days\nGiving you a reason for mysterious ways\nBehind doors the darkness falls\nYou pour a cup of coffee, and get talking walls\n\nBut you can blame it on me\nAnd the person you thought I wanted you to be\nBut don't you blame it on love\nCause you will regret it then, and from now on\n\nBesides from days gone by\nHours seem so slow you think you'll surely die\nYou decide to call up a friend\nWhen she doesn't answer you are close to the end\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
