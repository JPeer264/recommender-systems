        "A vision, a call\nIn times before my fall\nIn life before I became\nI dreamt I was insane\n\nI saw the unseen\nI heard the unheard\nI rode the sky above the earth\nI felt the breeze of the world\nI walked along\nI should have retrieved\nWhat was real as a merry blue sky\nWas long gone within of me\n\nCrimson tide\nWave of lost time\nScenario of a velvet blue sky\nI dreamt about day\nBut I lived in the night\nI looked and I saw\nThat in my dream I was free\nRed turned blue\nWhite became black\nThe daylight erased the shadow of me\n\nInsanity reached\nWhispering voice\nThe sky above the stars\nThe wind below the moon\nThe light created shadows\nThe dark beyond the eyes\nI sat before myself\nI looked above below\n\nDoves and birds, grass and trees\nWhere was all I used to see?\nWhy am I not\nWhat I used to be?\nI embrace\nMy living self\n\nI see the unseen\nI hear the unheard\nI learned the secret\nBut not before I learned\n\nNight divide day, day erase night\nLight of day, day of Darkness\n\nThey are inside my head\nClimbing the walls\nFalling off the ceiling\nJumping on the floor\nVoices and calls\nAnd on the edge of sanity\nI stumble and fall\n\nThrough the gates of the endless halls\n\nSoldier, walk with me\nThrough the valley of eternity\nIn passion I see\nAm I the one only the mirror sees?\nThrough the valley of eternity\nAm I the one only the mirror sees?\nA distant call for me\nI am lost within my memory\nLost in the maze\nThe secret place that no one's ever seen\nI am lost within my memory\nThe secret place that no one's ever seen\nSilent cries of despair\nThrough the valley of eternity\nWhat sanity remains\nWithin this fragile, twisted mind\n\nI am all alone\nMe, myself, and I\nEchoes pound my head\nShapeless forms everywhere\n\nI think, therefore I am\nYou are a fantasy\nMade by me\nI dream this world\nWhen I end, the world will end with me\nI am everything\nYou are me\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
