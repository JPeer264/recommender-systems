        "My nights don't seem so endless\nMy days don't seem so bare\nI'm walking on a cloud\nAnd there's music in the air\nI feel just like a live wire\nI've been thrilled through and through\nSince I first met you\n\nThe stars that shine at night\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "You left me you sent me through\nI'm all alone lost without you what shall I do?\nOut of the picture out of the frame\nAnd now when you see me nothings the same\nYour lips are kissing somebody new\nI'm out of the picture out of the view\nSmile for I've got nothing to smile for\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)"
