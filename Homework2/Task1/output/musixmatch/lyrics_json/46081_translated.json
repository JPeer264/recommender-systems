        "I lived a quiet life\na stranger to champagne\nI never dared to venture out\nto cities of the plain\nI'd heard about their way of life\ntook it with a pinch of salt\nThe freedom and the time to play\na life so easy\nit intrigued me\nwhen you called to say:\n\n\"Are you gonna go\nto the Sodom and Gomorrah Show?\nIt's got everything you need for your complete\nentertainment and instruction\nSun, sex, sin, divine intervention,\ndeath and destruction\nThe Sodom and Gomorrah show\nis a once-in-a-lifetime production\"\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We came down from the north\nBlue hands and a torch\nRed wine and food for free\nA possibility\nWe share our mothers' health\nIt is what we've been dealt\nWhat's in it for me\nFine, then I'll agree\n\nTrees there will be\nApples, fruits maybe\nYou know what I fear\nThe end is always near\n\nTrees there will be\nApples, fruits maybe\nYou know what I fear\nThe end is always near\n...\n\n", 
        "When i woke up this morning\nI said to myself\nshould laugh of should i cry\nit's a little bit strange building castles in the rain\nso i made up my mind and said to myself\n\nIt's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful day today\n...\n\n", 
        "If it seems I live for today\nYou and I don't see the same\nMost people take what's around\n\nWe had fun\nWhatever happened to all the things you wanted to be?\nYou used to be the one\nWho made me keep on\nYou were the reason I could believe in myself\n\nAnd I feel like floatin' away\nI find myself in a daze\nIt's a dream life anyway\n\nWhen we used to\n\nUptown\nBoogie down\nHear the sound\nMove it around\nNow, don't sit down\nThink about\nWho you love\nNow\nBoogie down\n...\n\n", 
        "You wanna rumble in my jungle\nI'll take you on\nStampede your rumpa\nAnd send you home\nYou wanna rumble in space\nI put my laser on stun\nAnd on the north pole I'll ice you son\n\nYou wanna thrilla in mah nilla\nYou'll be killer bee stung\nWanna taste of vanilla\nBetter watch your tongue\n\n'Cause I'll hammer your toe\nLike a pediatrician\nSaw you in half\nLike I'm a magician\nTear you down\nLike I'm in demolition\nCount you out\nLike a mathematician\n\nI'm so very hot that when I rob your mansion\n...\n\n", 
        "I walk along the city streets\nYou used to walk along with me\nAnd every step I take\nRecalls how much in love we used to be\nOh, how can I forget you\nWhen there is always something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me\nAs shadows fall I passed a small cafe\nWhere we would dance at night\nAnd I can't help recalling how it felt\n...\n\n", 
        "Thinking about you\nConstantly thinking about you\nThinking about you\nI've been thinking too much about you\nSee the sunset with no sleep at all\nConstantly thinking about you\nAnd I can't get through this at all\nThinking about you [2x]\nI've been thinking too much about you\nI've been staring at the floor\nI've listened to all the tunes I love\nBut makes me feel quite blue\n...\n\n"
