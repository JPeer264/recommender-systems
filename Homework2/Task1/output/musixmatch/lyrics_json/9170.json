        "These are not my people, I should never have come here\nThe chick with a dick and the gift for the gab\nI know a place, I've seen the face\nAnd I'll take the coast from factory to factory\nAh\n\nThese nights that I've been on the road\nThrough my window the moonlight she shone\nAnd on my walls the fire she danced\nPlaying out my very last chance to run, run, run, run\nDon't look back, you're moving too fast\nI know a place, I've seen the face\nAnd I'll take the coast from factory to factory\nOh yeah\n...\n\n", 
        "Turn the key & warm up the vehicle\nWindow's foggy & I'm in my little bubble\nSome are red, some are yellow\nBlack & blue & different colours\nMine is green\n\nLet's go\nLet's go\nLet's go play footsie with the pedal\nGet on the road\n\nIt glides underneath me\n...\n\n", 
        "Pack up all my cares & woes\nFeeling low, here I go\nBye bye, Blackbird\n\nWhere somebody waits for me\nSugar's sweet, so is she\nBye bye, Blackbird\n...\n\n", 
        "Winter's coming on\nOnly one place to be\nWith my baby\nOn those streets of\n\nNew York in the fall\nNo rooms to be had\nBut I can get an add-on\nI haven't booked ahead\n\nThought I had some sort of poll\nCertainly the money to spend\n...\n\n", 
        "When the day is short\nAnd the nights are long\nIt's a different world\nWhere the rules are wrong\nAnd I, I will go home with who\nWhoever is sure\nAre you sure?\n\nAnd I don't care if you\nIf you love me tomorrow just\nLove me tonight and I\nI will be all right\nI'll be all right\nI'll be all right\nUntil tomorrow night\n...\n\n", 
        "(2003 Tour Version)\n\nI slept through the night, I got through to the dawn\nI flipped a switch & the light went on\nI got out of bed, I put some clothes on\nIt was a pretty good day so far\n\nI turned the tap, there was cold, there was hot\nI put on my coat to go to the shop\nI stepped outside & I didn't get shot\nIt's a pretty good day so far\n\nI didn't hear sirens or explosions\nNo murders coming in from those heavy guns\n...\n\n", 
        "Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore\nAnd I'm young & I'm strong\nBut I feel old & tired\nOverfired\n\nAnd I've been poked & stoked\nIt's all smoke, there's no more fire\nOnly desire\nFor you, whoever you are\nFor you, whoever you are\n\nYou say my time here has been some sort of joke\nThat I've been messing around\nSome sort of incubating period\nFor when I really come around\nI'm cracking up\nAnd you have no idea\n\nNo idea how it feels to be on your own\nIn your own home\nwith the fucking phone\n...\n\n", 
        "How soon will I be seeing you?\nHow soon?\nI wish I really knew\nAnd when will I be hearing\nWords I want to hear\nPretty little love words\nWhispered in, in my ear\n\nHow soon will I be seeing you\nAnd dance the way we used to do?\nI see the starlight gleaming\n...\n\n", 
        "Summer comes and rain falls away\nBut the very next day it seems\nThe snow comes to stay\n\nAnd you too will go just like the dog days do\nI'll put on my hat, my gloves, my scarf\nTo keep the cold apart\n\nBut there are no hats, gloves, scarves for the heart\nJust a cold wind that leaves its frosted mark\n\nDon't forget that I will always love you\n...\n\n", 
        "I heard that you hate me\nYou know that I do\nThe words that come out of my mouth\nAnd the sounds telling me\nI hate you too\n\nNext time you should be more careful who\nYou're sitting next to\nI might know them\nAnd they can come & tell me\nAll about you\n\nWhat did I do?\nDid I get to you?\nMy arms, my tears, my love, my heart\nThe ocean in my heart\n...\n\n", 
        "Turn the key & warm up the vehicle\nWindow's foggy & I'm in my little bubble\nSome are red, some are yellow\nBlack & blue & different colours\nMine is green\n\nLet's go\nLet's go\nLet's go play footsie with the pedal\nGet on the road\n\nIt glides underneath me\n...\n\n", 
        "There's a door\nHandle's cold\nMade of iron & brass\nAnd this door it used to lead\nInto what is now my past\nIf you were to have opened this door\nIt would have lead you on to a floor\nWhere my mother had played almost 50 years before\n\nNuts & bolts galore\n...\n\n", 
        "Some scratch their heads or squint their eyes\nAll this time in precious smiles\nDedicated to this same guy\nI don't know why myself\n\nHe was wearing a ball cap & glasses\nI usually hate ball caps with glasses\nBut I fell in love with him\nSome might find him shy or goofy as sin\nI don't why, but I do love him\n\nLet's take a plane or cast a sail\nRide or ride by, walk or by rail\n...\n\n", 
        "I wrote this song late last night\nabout my brother and all his might\nand you would be so very kind\nto listen to these words I've written\nabout the boy who seems quite smitten\nbut like no other you will find\n\ncause baby I know the reasons why we were unkind\n\nHe's Laurel he's Hardy he's the life of the party\n...\n\n", 
        "It's all right\nLife's struggle's gone\nYou're understood\nAnd you can stop the fight\nYou will go to the sea\nLeave & take your flight\n\nI will stay at home\nWalk the streets\nAnd search the night\nFor the inspiration\nThe guiding sun caught my eyes\nI don't know what I will find\nI hope it's good, like your kind\n...\n\n", 
        "Would you care not standing so close\nI've got a promise that I gotta keep\nAnd I can't host\nThe idea of you & me engaged in a kiss\nIt's too dangerous & would be a mess\n\nCause I can't, you see\nSomeone's in love with me\nAnd I with he\nSo very deeply\n\nBut when things get so goddamn deep\nOne has the tendency to feel somewhat weak\n...\n\n", 
        "Met you for the first time late last week\nCame to dinner, cold and bleak\nBut I held back\nHeld myself on track\n\nQuestion of etiquette\nOr maybe just regret\n\nNoticed your blond hair\nYour blue eyes too\nI might have seemed quiet, a little shrewd\nI didn't wanna touch you\nYou seemed so new\nBut you looked just like me\nEighteen years ago\n\nNow I don't know where your mommy met my daddy\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you wanna wanna wanna grow up to be\nThe kind you only wanna shut up\nAnd if time runs through your veins\nAnd causes you nothing but pain\n\nYou're just like the rest of us\nYou're just like the rest of us\nYou're just like the rest of us\nYou're just like the rest of us\n\nMy mama told me to get to bed\nTo get my beauty sleep\nBut one day you get up\n...\n\n"
