        "Goodbye to you, my trusted friend\nWe've known each other since we were nine or ten\nTogether we climbed hills and trees\nLearned of love and A B C's\nSkinned our hearts and skinned our knees\n\nGoodbye, my friend, it's hard to die\nWhen all the birds are singing in the sky\nNow that the spring is in the air\nPretty girls are everywhere\nThink of me and I'll be there\n\nWe had joy, we had fun\nWe had seasons in the sun\nBut the hills that we climbed were just seasons\nOut of time\n\nGoodbye Papa, please pray for me\nI was the black sheep of the family\nYou tried to teach me right from wrong\nToo much wine and too much song\nWonder how I got along\nGoodbye Papa, its hard to die\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
