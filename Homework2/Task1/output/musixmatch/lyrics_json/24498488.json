        "Someday out of the blue\nIn a crowded street or a deserted square\nI'll turn and I'll see you\nAs if our love were new\nSomeday we can start again, someday soon\nHere comes the night\nHere come the memories\nLost in your arms\nDown in the foreign fields\nNot so long ago\nSeems like eternity\nThose sweet afternoons\nStill capture me\n(repeat )\nI still believe\nI still put faith in us\n...\n\n"
