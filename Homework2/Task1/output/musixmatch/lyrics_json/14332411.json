Thrift shop, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious\nSomewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater gang, nope, nope y'all can't copy yup.\nBad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway, and we did it, our way.\nGrown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it\nAnd yet I'm on.\nLet that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.\nMoney, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,\nBut I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town\nTrust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,\nChasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing\nLabels out here, now they can't tell me nothing\nWe give that to the people, spread it across the country\nLabels out here, now they can't tell me nothing\nWe give it to the people, spread it across the country\nCan we go back, this is the moment\nTonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us like the ceiling can't hold us\nCan we go back, this is the moment\nTonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over\nSo we put our hands up\n...\n\n", 
        "Somewhere off in outerspace\nThere's a world no wars, no hate\nWhere all the broken hearts are safe\nI don't know where it is\nI just imagine it\n\nWe are all gathered here right now\nI can feel it, it's about to go down\nThere's a time and place for a face in the crowd\nand today is the day, stand out\nStand up, stand your ground\nBe the who that you wanna be proud\nand when you feel like you can't make a sound\nRight there is the time we're supposed to get loud\nYou don't like those rules, remake 'em\n'Cause we're living a snow globe, shake 'em\nYou don't like what it was, then change what it is\n'Cause stories are what you make them\nWake up, get up and do something\nYou gotta wake up, get up and do something\nYeah, you don't take much but a simple equation\nYou plus your imagination\n\nSomewhere off in outerspace\nThere's a world no wars, no hate\nWhere all the broken hearts are safe\nI don't know where it is\nI just imagine it\n\nRight here I can almost touch it, so near\nWe can live in a world no fear\nIf you're with me say yeah!\nRight here I can see it all crystal clear\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll go wherever you go\nChasing through the streets of Monaco\nI'll run wherever you are, are\nI trust the rivers lead me to your heart\n\nEvery night every day\n(Whatever the world the story of us takes me)\nLost in the light of your flame\n(Whatever girl, whatever you need baby)\nNothing will get in my way\n(Not a thing)\nOh even if the brightest star burns out tonight\n\nWhy don't you close your eyes\nAnd we can leave it all behind\nWake up in paradise\nWhere the sunset never dies\nWe'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nDon't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\n\n(Never say, never never say)\nNever say bye\nNever ask why\nBaby don't you know we're the stars in the sky\nSo never say never\n\u2018Cause never don't fly\nBaby don't you know we're the stars in the sky\n\n...\n\n",
