        "From ripe to rotten\nToo real to live\nShould I lie down\nOr stand up and walk around again?\n\nMy eyes finally wide open up\nMy eyes finally wide open shut\nTo find a found of sound that hears the touch of my tears\nSmells the taste of all we waste\nCould feed the others\n\n...\n\n",

(they were cool)\nHe's on a honeymoon.\nHe took us to the apartment\n(been here a long time)\nalong with is his friends...\n(almost a month)\nsome of his friends who had been in the city\nto create a sea diving business.\n(almost a month now)\nIt's nicer than I thought it would be.\n(Sir James)\nI assumed it would be some warehouses\nwith cold water which I probably would've rather-ed.\n(passed out)\nWhenever I'm working it seems\nthat the closer I am to the ground, the better.\n(his hand clutching)\nWe went and dropped off our stuff, took a shower,\nand we head over to the studio.\n(last night)\nWhen we get there (I left a note)\nwe start rehearsing.\nHorrible, sloppy, zombie-like (Jamie)\nincoherent babble of sleep deprived\nwalking dead (it was quarter to 4)\n...\n\n"
