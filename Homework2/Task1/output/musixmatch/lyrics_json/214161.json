        "I could go on talking or I could stop\nWring out each memory til' I get every drop\nSift through the details of the others involved\nThe true crime would be thinking it's just one persons fault\nLike an honest signature on a fake ID\nLike the guilty conscience with the innocent plea\nYou can just ignore it put it out of mind\nBut ain't it funny how the past won't ever let something lie\nLets make a list of all things the world has put you through\nLets raise a glass to all the people your not speaking to\nI don't know what else you wanted me to say to you\nThings happen\nThat's all they ever do\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, Lou- I'd like to let you know that I do not feel welcome.\nAll the birds, the trees, the falling snow\nNo they were not made for me.\nAnd all this is where her heart resides; we met in California\nShe saw cities, promise reaching through my eyes\nAnd she turned her self away\n\nWell how I curse that western skyline.\nAnd yet I thanked it for my start.\nOh rue, though my dreams did not come true; no they only came apart.\n\nSo I followed her here to Birmingham, where the soil is so much richer\n...\n\n", 
        "I need a silent, true way to admire,\nlike you as a sunset and I as a wildfire.\nAnd I can't let the day go.\n\nI've locked up these words in fear that I'd say them wrong.\nIs it love as a mountain, or love as a simple song?\nAnd the moment that the two meet\nhas now laid itself at your feet.\n\nAnd love is not convenient.\nIt does not cease at your command.\nYou might take and leave it,\n...\n\n", 
        "If all my lovers sing the big words,\nand all my brothers keep them small,\nthen I'll get lost in the difference\nbetween their whisper and the echo of their call.\n\nSo I am headed for the ocean\nto let the sea smoke guide me in.\nI'd give up my belongings and questions\nThey only ever taught me, to begin.\n\nSo I will not turn around\nas I step up to the train,\nbut I'll hear it when you call my name.\nAnd I will not be the sound\nof your roof under the rain,\nbut I'll hear it when you call my name.\n\nSo I am takin' off my wristwatch\nto let the time move how I please,\n...\n\n", 
        "Give me time.\nGive me time.\nIf there's one thing you could give\nto help me show you all that's mine,\ngive me time.\n\nShow me love.\nShow me love.\n...\n\n", 
        "There were moments of dreams\nI was offered to save.\nI lived less like a workhorse,\nmore like a slave.\nI thought that one quick moment\nthat was noble or brave\nwould be worth the most of my life.\n\nSo I pointed my fingers\nand shouted few quotes I knew,\nas if something that's written\nshould be taken as true.\nBut every path I had taken\nand conclusion I drew\nwould put truth back under the knife.\n\nAnd now the only piece of advice that continues to help\nis anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else.\n\nWhen my time comes,\n...\n\n", 
        "Take your last look around\nTake the fall that is due\nAnd take your time and I'll take mine\nIt's the last thing that's left for us to do\n\nYou have tried to define romance\nAnd all the things that it is not your time\nBecame some old man's cane\nWhile he dances to a song that he forgot\n\nOh, you can't throw something\nOut there without watching it fall\nOnly thing that's scarier\nThan dying is not dying at all\n\nSo when I have lost all my control\n...\n\n", 
        "Some time as a much older man\nI will sit down and put on this song.\nIt just might make me cry,\nOr at the very least a tear in my eye.\n\nI can't take all these years of my life\nTo be widdle down into a thought\nThat only appears to the year\nI made memories perfectly clear.\n\nMama, mama\nMama, mama.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Go ahead and let your hands stay entwined,\nI swear I could not possibly mind.\nAnd when she lets down her guard,\nDon't kiss her too hard.\nShe's sure to repay in kind.\n\nDon't let your courtesy last too long,\nMy love blooms when I know it's gone.\nSo if I'm in the room,\nIt should be fair to assume:\nYou can both act how you want.\n\nAnd I won't cross the line you drew\nCause I'm not here to compete\n...\n\n", 
        "Take me out of the city\nWhere my shadow can roam\nLet me breathe in the morning\nLet my way be my home\nTake me out of the city\nTrue love I will not find\nTake me in new one's heart\nTake me out of my mind\nI feel my reflection slide\n...\n\n", 
        "1, 2, 3\n\nI want love to stretch it's fingers wide\nAnd touch on all our wandering parts.\nCome, sit by my Californian side\nWith your Carolina heart\n\nIf you let me be your anchor\nI will hold you down\nIf you let me be your anchor\nI will hold you down\n...\n\n", 
        "these days my friends don\u2019t seem to know me\nwithout my suitcase in my hand\nwhere I am standing still\nI seem to disappear\nbut maybe that's how I found you\nmaybe that's taugh me exactly what I want\nmaybe meeting you so far away from home\nis what makes it all so clear\nbut you got that special kind of sadness\nyou got that tragic set of charms [chorus]\nthat only comes from time spent in Los Angeles\nmakes me wanna wrap you in my arms\n...\n\n", 
        "ddressing a prayer into the air\nAnd the shadows of lights\nSo nobody heard love's not for words\nIn a world at the end of it's night\n\nFor everyone that left me\nThey're so easy to forget\n'Cause I haven't let my failures hit me yet.\n\nYour voice on the phone\n...\n\n", 
        "Did you hear the one about a joke without a punch-line\nOr the song about a movie of a book\nLike a stolen bouquet meant to be given away\nTo the girl that never gives you a look\n\nWell that's how I've been spending all my meantime\nWondering if it's doing any harm\nResetting myself to when everything felt\nLike a book I'm holding under my arm\n\nBut it's not that I want back all my innocence\nJust the joy of losing it again\n\nThe favorites get their favors\n...\n\n"
