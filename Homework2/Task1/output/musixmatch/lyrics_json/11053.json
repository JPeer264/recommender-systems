        "Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess\nQuite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess, quite a mess\n\nSomeone convinced me of jealousy\nIt's the best compliment I'll ever get\nSo I shouldn't be the sad girl\nshouldn't but I said I was\nAnd who's going to tell\nwho's going to tell this time?\n\nIt's a blizzard outside\nDon't you dare stay inside\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey you little wreck over there\nHave I got news for you\nThe walls up in my room are pretty cold\nOh can you feel it\nLike a ... bat after nightfall\n\nWho will crack a good joke\nWho is ready to smile\nWho will crack a good joke\nWho is ready to try\n\n[Chorus:]\nMy downhill race\nYou said it's got no end\nCount down the days\nYou said this had to wait\n\nYou poor little thing over there\nI play the blues for you\n...\n\n", 
        "Bang, banging the door\nI just have to get out\nSweet talk 'til I'm bored\nStop killing my time\n\nYou're way up in the air\nAlways flashing around\nIt's all making me sick\nBut looking good from above\n\nHere comes the first attack\nFive fingers to black it out\nThere's no turning back\nI'm proud to say I'm paying the price\n\nI'm on top of your world\nOnce and for all and forever to be\n...\n\n", 
        "Are teenage dreams so hard to beat\nEverytime he walks down the street\nAnother boy in the neighbourhood\nWish he was mine, he looks so good\nI wanna hold him wanna hold him tight\nGet teenage kicks right through the night\nI'm gonna call him on the telephone\nHave him over cos i'm all alone\n...\n\n"
