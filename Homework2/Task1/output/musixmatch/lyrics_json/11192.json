        "Angry on the outside angry on the in\nDisgruntled with the thing I see\nLooking for a future that lies in your hands\nIs such a bad place to be\nEducated hippies and psychedelic yups\nReally gets my Irish up\nI am just a beggar, begging for some money\nSpare some change to fill my cup\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sitting here in a big old box Getting help for my vice\nGot a sink and a toilet with aview like the rest of the mice\nI lie awake and I shake like a rabid dog waiting to attack\nand I crave like an addict and I'm afraid that the beast is back\n\nThe beast is back The beast is back The beast is back The beast is back\n\n...\n\n",
