        "Can I prevent this loss and pain to hasten my release\nOr am I damned to existence alone\nSear me child, let this pain set me free again\nWith broken promise, never know what this life could bring\nAnd the time spent alone sorting through emotions\nIs a blessing that I know I cannot repay\nWith only words I can't express my deep regret\nOf time gone by and of feelings that I'll never know\nPain believed but never shared has left me damaged here\nMy wounds will bleed anew, I am now exposed\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll not want for longing, it causes heartache yet this singularity burns just the same\nHope for ash of memory, this is pure agony\nEyes, they are too blind to see, this is pure agony\nI'll not beg for you, this is pure agony\nKnowing whats been true, this is pure agony\nFall from your light world, not again, this breeds fear\nMy life weakens and the pain I hold tight\nLife hurts so now, I have no power here\nCease living somehow, I long to release you\n\nAs I fall I... As I fall we cry in despair\nDon't be lifeline... don't be my lifeline, let me fall away\nAlone, desolate. alone and desolate am I the only one\n...\n\n",
