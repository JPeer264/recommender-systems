        "Mother warned me, she told me\nLife isn't what we dream of\nSo don't sleep boy, stay restless\nDon't put your hopes in this world\n'Cause your love won't last, you'll be haunted by fear\nOh my God what have I told my son?\n\nMother I can't say quickly\nWhat should be penned so eloquently\nBut I will try this one time\n'Cause something inside's not right\nWith the world outside, with who hate who more\nSo I'll take my lonely pen and write\n\nI'll write smiles in the sun, I'll applaud my old heroes\nI will sing at graves, I will sing so sweet Mother\nI will trust in dreams, I won't bend to the seasons\nThis is how I'd like to see everything in the world\nEverything in the world\nBut there's one thing I don't want\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Goodbye\nI will miss you so much\nMy darling\nThere's more\nBut I cannot tell you\nAt this time\nCould somebody please help me find my Layli? Can you see the sstorms that rage in my eyes?'Cause they only come\nWhen they see I'm alone\n...\n\n", 
        "So you want a tale\nOr a fable, maybe one great story\nWell I can't\nIt's not in me, no I just don't believe\nIn such a world that could replace you and me\nYes that's my folly\n\nAs we sing and laugh and dance and play\nSo intoxicated in the ways\n'Cause I love to see myself in you\n...\n\n"
