        "Raging\nFoaming\nThis sea of disillusion\nThrows it's blinded anger\nback at the shore\nWhere longing eyes\nDesperately seek the dawn\nYet, all is black\nNothing can defeat\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Her vision only told her\nShe'd have to hold on tight\nLet the reigns in her hands show her\nWhere she'd have to ride\n\nWaiting for her chosen time\nTo steal the heart of her knight\n\nShe's a thief in the moonlight\nShe only rides the night\ncan't you feel her gaining?\nShe's riding close behind\n\nLike a Desperado in modern times\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
