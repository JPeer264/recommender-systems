        "Any chimp can play human for a day.\nUse his opposable thumbs to iron his uniform\nand run for office on election day\nfancy himself a real decision maker\nand deploy more troops than salt shakers.\n\nBut it's a jungle when war is made,\nand you'll panic and throw your own shit at the enemy.\nThe camera pulls back to reveal your true identity.\nLook, it's a sheep in wolf's clothing.\nA smoking gun holding ape.\n\nAny asshole can open up a museum.\nPut all of the things he loves on display\nso everyone could see them.\nThe house, a car, a thoughtful wife\nordinary moments in his ordinary life.\n\nBut if she breaks a smile, she'll give you away\n'cause no one wants to pay to see your happiness.\nNo one wants to pay to see your day to day\nand I'm not buying it either\nbut I'll try selling it anyway.\n...\n\n"
