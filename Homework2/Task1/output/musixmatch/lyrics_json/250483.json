        "Motherfuckers try and mess with us\nBefore seeing what we're all about\nThink you'd better open up your eyes\nBefore opening up your mouth\n...\n\n", 
        "The clocks been ticking for a very long time\nYou've tried our patience, in your heart this has died\nYou just amused us with the shit and the lies\nBut now you're gone this is something you can't lay to rest\n\nWe've come this far\nYou can only make us stronger!\n\nIt's not about friendship\n...\n\n", 
        "Who's laughing now?\nI've tried too many times to pick this up from the ground\nBut always found a problem\nAlways lost my fucking sound\nBut I won't ever fail in what I love best\nI've put my hopes and dreams and my anger to the test\nI've failed many times before\n...\n\n", 
        "After all I'd done for you\nNo matter how hard I tried\nIt wouldn't matter to me much right now\nIf you curled up and died\nIt's nearly a year on, and I'd wiped you from my mind\nI'm so fucking glad I turned you down, than kept you by my side\n...\n\n", 
        "If you know me by now, you should know the way I think\nI'm not a totally arrogant cunt but my attitude fucking stinks\n\nI always mean what I say and do but these are my opinions they're not the truth\nI just open my mouth and let fucking loose\nYou can think what you want, it's your choice so choose\nDon't expect me to change my ways\nWith these foolish thoughts is the way I'll stay\n...\n\n", 
        "The joke's on you\nYou're hiding at the back of the room\nNow I'm coming out to find you\nYou made your last mistake\nYou pushed me way too fucking far\nHow dare you fucking doubt me?\n\nIf you're putting your shit above the things that count\nThen your days are numbered\n...\n\n", 
        "The thing that pushes me harder\nIs the fact you don't believe in anything that I stand for\nAnd you'll never try to see why I live my life this way\nWhy I'm different from you\nI don't mean to spite anyone with anything I do\n\nI keep my head in tune with the feelings in my heart\nYou always come around\n...\n\n", 
        "I still don't know who the fuck you are\nBeen disputing that for many years now\nStill don't know why you've come this far\nStill trying to be friends with me\nWhat's the point in pretending one thing?\nThen making a fool of yourself to us\nTrying to please every hand that feeds you\nBut double standards is another fucking story\n...\n\n", 
        "Slit open your throat and piss down your neck\nTie you to my car and drive til you're dead\nBreak into your house and set fire to you in your bed\nWhen you get out cunt, better watch where you tread\nCos there's hundreds of us who are after your head\nWe'll come down on you like two tonnes of lead\nYou've fucked yourself over and you better regret\nWe'll end your life for you there's no need to fret\n...\n\n", 
        "Your a half measure that's all you are to me\nYour tying to be something you'll never be\nWe're fucking proud let's get one thing straight\nYou're nothing to us, you're weak and a fake (you're a fake)\n\nToo much time wasted chatting shit\nIt gets too much once we turn up the heat\nWhere not dictating, we're thinking aloud\nExpressing the view that makes us proud\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Bleeding knuckles and broken smiles\nWith these friendships gone, I see it all worthwhile\nand still I can't see myself apologizing to anyone\nFor something I never done\n\nThere's no point in trying hard\nTo be a nice person or make myself seem kind\nCos I burn bridges and never stop\nHating the person you always was\n\nI wont always reprimand\nIt takes to long for you to understand\nThe blood stays on the blade\nAnd blood drips from the knuckles of my hand.\n\nI'm not trying to make out some fight\nBut I've been brought up to do what's right\nAnd in my opinion despising you\nIs the heritage and basics of everything I ever learned\n...\n\n",
