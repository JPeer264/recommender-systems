        "Don't trust him\nWhen he turns his back\nHe looks at you\nDon't trust him\nWhen his eyes are closed:\nHe still looks at you\n\nI fled, I fled\nDevouring the space\nBut the shapeless bulk\nWas chasing me -enraged-\nBreathing my footsteps\nUnsated with killing me\nSlowly\nNailing my incandescent thoughts\nAlong the border\nOf insanity\nIn a place where\nA procession of fleshly numbers\nSlides incessantly\nInto the ironic waters\nOf the cosmos\nSeeking to remember\nThe sense\nOf the impossible word:\nEscape\n\n\"Who are you looking for?\nWhat are you looking at?\"\nA light? \"a star\"\nA boat? \"an insect\"\nA plane? \"a flying fish\"\n\n\"I'm looking at somebody\nWho belongs to my world\"\n\"This is your world\nI am your only world\"\n\nI can't remember\nWhen the fog\n- unravelling\nThe real and inexplicable\nContradictions\nThat crowd together\nThe human brain lobes -\nImprisoned me\nIn the spider's web\nOf the one who touches\nThe minds of the mad\n...\n\n", 
        "While on the surface\nLight and shade take turns\nAnd smile and tears\nAnd fair and ugly\nSaint and nasty\nAnd the monstrous\nIs just the different:\nTiny crack in the globe's perfection\n\nDown there swarms excess:\nWhere exception is the rule\nAnd the loathsome\nSpreads always\nUnexplored dimensions\nAnd sundry doors\nOpen on the magma:\nThe black holes\n\nIn the terrible adventure\nOf each night\nWhose irrational daring\nSprings only\nFrom the ignorance\nOf danger\nThe doors open wide\nAnd streams of unknown\nFlow into the sleep\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I dread the great winged insects\nAnd the cat-headed butterflies;\nAbove all the fleshy wings\nOf the birds\nTrying to clutch me\nAt times I thought\nI was a glass bowl\nAnd I trembled\nFearing ti be cracked\nOr I felt as if\nI had committed\nA horrible crime\n(But... which one?)\nSinking off (only)\nAt night\n\nThen I was in a vast garden\nAnd I cut the tree in the middle\n\"Tree of the knowledge\nOf dood and evil\"\nBuilding a vessel\nThat I named \"Narrenschiff\"\nAnd I sailed through\nBlack waves of clotted blood\nClosing my eyes...\n\nWhwn I opened them\n...\n\n",
