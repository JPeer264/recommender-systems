        "All poison and thrills,\nA head full of pills\nWaiting around\nNails cut too quick\nYou broke what you fixed\nYou're so underground\n\nWhat you're waiting for\nWhat you're waiting for\nSaid and done\nBut it's too late to turn your age around\nShe's not the one you want\n\nOne settles the score\n...\n\n", 
        "Wait and fight\nYou never threatened to stop breathing countless times\nWhen it wouldn't make a sound\nBaby eyes\nThe whole thing is a fading senseless blur\nConcern, but I'm letting go of her\n\nI don't know why it is\nIsn't it obvious to me?\nSympathy\nI'm sure that after this\nYou can feel anything at all\nResembling\n\n...\n\n", 
        "'Never love anyone else'\nIs promise you made me yourself.\nThere's a box with his ring on the shelf,\nAnd it's tarnished.\nThe burden of liars and thieves\nIs the baggage that you brought overseas.\nNo matter if you beg and you plead\nThis is over.\n\nWhoa\nThat's just the way it would go.\nNo matter how the dice didn't roll,\nYou'll never be alone.\n\nA promise, a vow, a commitment.\nThe bottle won't help you forget this,\nAnd I'm swearing with God as my witness,\nThis is sorry.\n...\n\n", 
        "Road map is a bitter pill\nScene stinks of a double deal\nA good front like the devil will\nYour eyes on the prize\n\nCome clean like you said you would\nAnd make peace like I know you could\nHeroes don't do any good\nWith tears in their eyes\n\nFight the good fight\nMaintain the trend\n...\n\n", 
        "I saw my better half, the better half of a decade\nSlip through my hands inside her hands inside my pockets\nWhen she reached for her advantages\nI should have done something\n\nI saw my baby boy digging his own hole\nKeepin' alive family traditions\nWhen he lied about intentions\nI, I should have done something\nI should have done something\n...\n\n", 
        "You've got some nerve I never knew,\nWhat with the world we gave away in front of you.\nI see it all\nMuch clearer now.\nYou're just a phase\nI've gotten over anyhow.\n\nIt's over,\nI'm not giving in again.\n\nWe're loyal like brothers,\nJust us versus all the others.\nYou the one for\nYou the one for me?\n\nI trusted misleading\nPromises worth repeating.\nHow could you do this to me?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I think I've waited long enough\nOur world was once forget me not\nAnd now I wait another year, I need you here\n\nI think I've heard this one before\nBut it's not you walking through my door\nAnd now I wait another year, I need you here\nI need you here, I need you here, I need you here\n\nDon't bother it now, let sleepers lie\n...\n\n", 
        "Sooner or later more,\nThese words to paper pour.\nCompose apologies, To bring you back to me.\nWhat words were written for:\nOne girl whose pages tore.\nI'll bet you never knew, With a letter came a fool for you.\nShe says she'd worked it out,\n...\n\n", 
        "I wonder when I wander home\nIf I'll be fit to drink alone.\nSleep with my memories,\nPictures, apologies.\n\nFor every minute yesterday,\nRegret reminds me anyway.\nIf I remember anything,\nI'll make mistakes again.\n\nLast night on the Mass Pike,\nThought I was losing you.\n...\n\n", 
        "We cannot work out what has to be said.\nAn image painted black in the back of my head.\n\nIt came so clear last night,\nYou showed me that your words mean more than actions do,\nI was listening to you.\nSomeone is listening,\nThat someone is you.\n\nYou build me up,\nYou break me down again,\n...\n\n", 
        "It's been proven, hundreds over since,\nThe decision was the best that we could make.\nIf I wasn't clear before\u2026\n\nThat's not what I said.\nThat's not what I said.\nAnd I bent over backwards just to speak.\nIf you've got things straight in your head,\nThen you've got bigger problems than me.\n...\n\n", 
        "They're my reasons for getting over this,\nAnd it's not much better than,\nWaking up to your head in your hands,\nWhen your arms are tired from supporting you.\n\nIt's better in the long run.\nIt's better in the long run.\n...\n\n", 
        "It's certainly true, there's better things to do.\nAnd though I don't know everything,\nI wouldn't tell you anything if I did.\n\nThe last time I saw you act like this we were kids.\nThe last time I saw you act like this we were kids.\n\nWhat am I to do?\nMy heart goes out to you.\nThough I don't know everything\nI wouldn't tell you anything if I did.\n\nOver reacting, over again\u2026 just between friends.\nWhat am I to do?\nI won't come between you two.\n...\n\n", 
        "Made a grave mistake\nAn all too common place\nnot the first time back again\nit's obvious the risks\noutweigh the benefits\nshould have used our heads\ncouldn't happen to me\nno\nthere's no safe hiding place in thinking you're immune\n...\n\n"
