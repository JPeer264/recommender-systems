It has been calling the heavens to me\nBut I cannot hide\nAll the emptiness inside\nMy Fleeting Heart\nOnce in my dreams\nI rose and soared\nNo matter how I'm knocked around\nOr beaten down\nI will stand up, restored\nAll of my love has yet to wake\nI know your strength is what I lack\nYou've got my back and know that I've got yours\nI have you to thank for lighting up the dark\nBecause you're here with me our dreams will soar free\nFOREVER\nI wanna always be with you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
