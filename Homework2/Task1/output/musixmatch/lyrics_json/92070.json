        "What you at my gentle spoken friend\nI lack a frame to put you in\nWhen you're an ocean and a rock away\n\nI feel you in the pocket of my overcoat\nMy fingers wrap around your words\nAnd take the shape of games we play\n\nI feed your words through my buttonholes\nI bring them to my fingerless gloves\nGreen and prone to fraying\n\nThoughts of you warm my bones\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I have lost you to sleep again\nSleeping as we do on opposite sides of a venn diagram\nI read the time in shadows on your wall\nThe shards of light through the slats on your window\n\nI ease myself from under your languid arm\nI fumble on my boots and hear you breathe through your alarm\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)",
