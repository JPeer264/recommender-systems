        "This breath I take with you in mind.\nThis war we fight, we'll fight by your side\nI'll do anything to keep us together\nWe'll do anything to give you all exposure\nI'll be there to comfort you\nAt all cost\nThis world will do anything\nto release it's demons\n...\n\n", 
        "I have been in this daily battle long enough\nTo know its time to bring this to an end.\nA call to be pure, to be so clean.\nA call for action\nI lift my prayers to you father,\nBring us to our knees.\nLet me hear your voice in this time of need,\n...\n\n", 
        "Can we pay back more than can be measured?\nIf we could love\nIf we could love\nThere is an amount of love\nAn amount of grace\nBeyond all meaning\nBeyond all measure\nIf we could even grasp it\nThere would be more pleasure\n...\n\n", 
        "We're all people with a dream.\nSome good, some bad\nSome are real, and some are just fads.\nWho will come out on top,\nAnd who will just give it up?\nGod has his own plans for us.\nIt's not ours, it's His.\n...\n\n", 
        "You mean the world to me\nThoughts of you not being here with me\nYou're giving up without looking for a way out\nWalk towards the light\nStop this time bomb on yourself\nThere is more to this world than you could ever imagine\nA love so pure, wanting to lift you up\n...\n\n", 
        "We've made it too easy\nTo excuse everything we do as acceptable;\nOr that it's just like everyone else.\nThe popularity of something\nDoes not excuse it.\nWe cannot live a life of sliding.\n...\n\n", 
        "This is a call out to all who are left\nAll brothers and sisters who take the title:\nYou choose for yourself,\nAnd if you claim the name, so be it.\nBut get your head in the game.\nLet's live it.\nFor if we call on God, it's clear.\nHe has made it simple.\nHis eternal power and divine nature is clearly seen,\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you have a passion?\nFind something that you love\nRun with it, don't stop for anyone else\nNo one can get you down\nYou are better than that\n...\n\n", 
        "May the world know that I am yours.\nI will never be silenced.\n\nI will resist my sin to the point of blood, and I will\nwear my scars like badges of honor.\nBut let my hope cry out that my God is greater than the pain of persecution.\n...\n\n", 
        "Grace is my destiny, but pride is my home. Your words have called me from my comfort. I\u2019ll give you my life, if you\u2019ll hold it in your truth, because truth is the pursuit that captivates my soul. And, teacher, to be honest, I am very afraid.\n\nThis is all I have. I come before you broken. This is all I have. Tell me there is more than this.\n...\n\n", 
        "Let the trumpet sound for the coming King. The almighty approaches! Let the whole world see. Wake up! This is really\nhappening--the locusts devouring everything. The great and dreadful day of the Lord has fallen on the land. May you bear the mark of righteousness. We will\nnot be forsaken. May your conviction stand to profess: we will not be forgotten.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "You're not alone, my son.\nI made you for so much more than this.\nDon't be afraid, my child., for I have overcome the world.\nGo tell the world that I would die for them to know me.\nAnd I would die for them to live.\n...\n\n", 
        "Prepare the way for the Lord to enter in. We must become a people who value righteousness again. Now, we can only stand back and hope to see Him move, or we can be the willing hands of a mighty, living God. Make your choice. Now is the time. But, as for me, I call down fire. God, rain fire.\n\nI believe that God will raise the dead, and He will use these hands to do it. I believe that God will heal the sick. And He has sent me forth to say: \u201cHe alone is God. Prepare for His victory.\u201d\n...\n\n", 
        "An army approaches! Arise! Prepare! This is the Word from the mouth of God. And in it\u2019s power you will find life.\n\nWe are the watchmen of the new generation, and we will stand faithful; as intercessors and as prophets, as those who call down the breath of God to fill the dead. Know they will arise. Prophecy: \u201cDry bones, claim your life\u201d.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Here I am, God. Send me to the world. There is a burden on my heart to let the world know that You are God. From You, the mighty King of Kings, I learn the word that sustains the weary heart. But, I have been silent for far too long. I love them too much to sit back and watch them die. So take the life that you gave to me, Lord, and speak your heart to a generation.\n\nBrothers and sisters, my prayer for you has been heard. And you can take refuge and hope in this Word: This is the end of the world as we know it. Death will hold no power. Dry your tears and lift your head. Death will hold no power.\n...\n\n", 
        "Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name. Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name. And give us a new name. And call us your people, God. And give us a new name.\n\n...\n\n"
