        "Come close your eyes, take my hand\nwhy don't you jump with me\ndeep into the great unknown,\na fantasy\n\nAn ocean to be explored\nwhere no one's gone before\nwonders everywhere,\nI'll take you there\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I cut off my hair\nput some red in every nail on my feet\nI think its pretty.\n\nRepainted all the rooms\ngot a cat that i named June obviously\nI think she's happy.\n\nfriends threw some parties\nand to them all there's not one that i miss\nand I...\n\ntry to spend my time with some body new\n...\n\n", 
        "Waves of reality\nLifting me unexpectedly\nLooking inside to see\nVisions of you and me\n\nConfide my heart to you\nBlindly erase my every doubt\nSurrender myself to you\nFor passion I've lived without\n\nRain\nIn the mystery\nWaking all of my dreams suddenly\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't count\nStars in the sky\nOr climb the mountains\nI can't even swim all the seas\nBut I know\nAbsence is unfair\nNothing can replace what I miss\n\n'Cause I'm breathing\nFar away from you\nAnd every second feels like thousands more without you\nI'm breathing\nFor this love to live\nBelieve that one day life will take me there beside you\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a tiger\nKnow how to lure you with my feline's touch\nA trouble spider\nCan make a trap to catch the one I want\nBut fine as a white dove\nI'd do anything for the one I love\nTo get that one kiss\nI'll wait patiently like a chrysalis\n\nJust remember\nThat I can be strong and tender\nJust remember and beware\n\nC/o\n\nCause I know the way to break your heart\nThe way to tell a lie like you do\nOh yes\nI know the way to make you cry\nThe way to give you doubts\nLike you do\n\nSatisfy me\nWant you to treat me like I'm a queen bee\nThe woman in me\nJust like a wild horse I need to run free\n...\n\n", 
        "Ego lies in human nature\nScars the face in every one of us\nWhat's mine is mine\nWhat's yours is yours\nIt seems like we forget about the heaven's floor\n\nSet a wider gap between us\nWe build up walls without no shame\nWe turn away\nIf you're not one of us\nBut I thought, there's one color in our blood\n\nC/o\n\nWe run around in circles\nWhy not reach for a truth eternal\nLiving life that's so superficial\nWe'll drown in the tears of sorrow\n\n...\n\n", 
        "\"Want You To Want Me\"\n\nI'm here give me a glance, been following you like a shadow\nThis is how I spent my time dreaming about our days tomorrow\nAnother day has gone bye another moon another sun\nI can wait for you my love\nDon't want to do any harm\nJust trying to get to your attention\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes we forget to remember\nTo learn higher and to aim further\nBut sometimes we go too far\nToo far to understand who we are\n\nOh, I don? t know how\nThe world keeps turning\n...\n\n", 
        "Thank you for blessing the road I walk on\nThat I'm walking on\nI'm sorry for every mistake I fall on\nCan't help but fall\n\nYou've changed this heart in me\nAnd I know, I can always count on you\nTo give me the signs\n\nIn the wind on my face\nEach time I try to run\nFrom the sight of your grace\nFrom the wrongs I have done\n\nYou shine down your ligh\nT each time I need a guide\nI say to hearts in despair\n...\n\n", 
        "It's certainly deceiving\nCause love has fooled you once again\nYou can't believe in\nThat she's walking over you\n\nIf she's amazing\nWhy can't she be true to you\nWhat she hides she denies\nBut you'll never question why\n\nC/o\n\nShe's so hypocritical\nShe talks illogical\nShe's irrational\nNon angelical\nShe's so unsensual\nLives for the physical\nShe's so cynical\nNon angelical\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm tired of letting go all that I've tried to have\nI'm tired of wasting time looking up to the wrong stars\nI do believe in life and that everything is written\nBut life is not a book with pages wide-opened\n\nDon't search too far, my mother says\nSometimes all that you need is only a step away\n\nLook into yourself\nThe one and only\nLook into yourself\nIf you want to find the key\nA look into yourself\nRelease your heart free\nLook into yourself\nAnd be the master of your destiny\n\nDon't be afraid of wanting changes in your life\n...\n\n", 
        "Tell me is it worth the pain\nWhen your pride plays the wrong game\nBlinded by suspicious mind\nThougt u could read my heart and cross the line\n\nIn everything you see\nKeep everything back me\n\nThough my broken heart, tear my dreams apart\nI'll be alright\nI'll be alright\n\nJust a broken heart, not a word to fight\nI'll be alright\n...\n\n", 
        "Its all in your mind\nIn Your Mind...\n\nI don't want to believe\nAnd I don't want to live\nBy the excuses\nOf your weakness\n\n'cause a woman should do\nWhat she wants to do\nThere is no reason\nFor your shallow aggravation\n\nnohing wrong with this dress I wear\nNothing wrong with this smile I dare\nNothing wrong with my long black hair\nIt's all in your mind, in your mind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "When I can't see right in your eyes\nWhen I'm surrounded in the craziness of time\nWhen you're understanding, is trying hard to stand still\nWhen I wear layers of my pride, you should\n\nUndress me, undress me\nUnlock this chain and set me free\nRemind me to be myself\nUndress me, undress me\nUnleash my heart and make me see\nWhen I become someone else\n\nWhenever I'm trapped in this tide\nWhen I forgotten that there is you and I\n...\n\n", 
        "I cut off my hair\nput some red in every nail on my feet\nI think its pretty.\n\nRepainted all the rooms\ngot a cat that i named June obviously\nI think she's happy.\n\nfriends threw some parties\nand to them all there's not one that i miss\nand I...\n\ntry to spend my time with some body new\n...\n\n"
