I know, I know.\nDon't go...\nSummertime, the taste of saint secretes and perfume mist\n...\n\n", 
        "I fancy you but I've been destitute\nAnd all I know dissolved, I could never re-undo you\nI will always say it's so, I will always speak the truth\nDescend into a noose, I could never re-undo you\n\nI want to bury you\nI want to bury you\n\nVultures circle around\nFeathers float, wings flap, beaks pound\nAnd though my hearts exposed\nI could never re-undo you\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Holy eyes, I never knew I'd beg down at your feet\nHold on tight, I never knew I'd know much more than this\nOpen sky, the wave of pain, the scent of you is bliss\nHungry eyes, they stare at me, I know, I know\nDon't go\n\nSummertime, the taste of saint secretes a perfume mist\n...\n\n",

        "I'm living on shattered faith\nThe kind that likes to restrict your breath\nNever been a better time than this\nSuffocate on eternal bliss\n\nIn a city\nThat swells with so much hate\nYou seem to rise above\nAnd take its place\nThe heart pumps until it dies\nDrain the blood, the heart is wise\n\nAll my friends are murder\nAll my bones no marrows in\nAll these fiends want teenage meat\nAll my friends are murderers\n\nAway\n...\n\n", 
        "Its going down tonight in this town\nCause they stare and growl\nThey all stare and growl\nI take a scar everytime I cry\nCause it ain't my style, no it ain't my style\nGoing down to the gravel head to the barrel\nTake this life and end this struggle\nLos Angeles come scam me please\nEmptiness never sleeps at Cliftons 6am\nWith your bag lady friend and your mind descending\nStripped of the right to be a human in control\nIts warmer in hell so down we go\n\nThey say\nThis is the city\n...\n\n", 
        "Holy, Holy, Rocket\nI wanna be your sparket\nHoly, Holy, Rocket\nI wanna be your...\n\nYeah, I'm okay\nHey, It's to late\nNow's, the time\nAnd, It's okay\nYeah, I'm just late\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I am a death house haunted mirror\nAcerbic heart aint nothing pure in here\nI keep the memories of a broken you\nSing sing the stories of a fractured few\n\n...\n\n"
