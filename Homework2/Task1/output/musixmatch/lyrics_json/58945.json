        "Screaming\nRunning in delight to face another day\nBleeding\nWe do our part listen what I say\nCalling\nTo become the woods\nThe way to be the answer\nAnd falling too\nDeeper, ever deeper\nFly higher\n\nFlying\nIt is drying in a certain way\nNever trying too hard to push too far\nThe art of breathing - slowly\nListen now and listen good\nCalling\nHigher, ever higher\nGo deeper\n...\n\n", 
        "Strain of life begun\nTo live the day for you\nEach moment became heavier\nThan the last one\nThe wrong way accused\nAnd not to blame for not being free\n'Everyone is out to get you\nEveryone except you'\n\nFeeling\nControl\nSilence\nIs only a dream now\nDream now\n\nWhat have you not tried\nWhy haven't you tried\nTo see for yourself\nWho dwells inside\nThere beyond excuses\n...\n\n", 
        "Let the eyes burn slowly\nThe tears will cease to fall\nAnd the vision becomes... clear\nThe sun of the midday finding a way\nIn the night veil\n\nPurple and translucent\nEver changing so quiet\nBlack and transparent\nEver moving so quiet\n\nThis is living\nChoosing a best way to stay\nWithin a day...\nLike a dream\nA midnight name\n...\n\n", 
        "Hold on\nThere is some\nBelieving to be done\nConfigure\nThe undertaking that is going on\n\nRemember\n...\n\n", 
        "What did you see?\nShadows are gone\nIn the light of the day\nHow did you feel?\nA hero\nA victim with nothing to say\nWhat did you find?\nA place in the dark\nOr in shining light\nWhat did you hide?\nShadows and secrets\n...\n\n", 
        "Can there ever be a day\nTo come back away\nOr another shade of gray\nThere are days when feelin' blue\nIt reaches me and you\nSo what else is there to do\nIt will go through\n\nOpen the door\nTo a wider scene of life and love\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey brother\nMake way for patience\nOr there is a chance\nTo breath through frustration\nPIck it up\nFill it up\nNot splashing a single drop\nThere is a lot of peace,\nTranquility\nOn the calm surface of the heart\n\n...\n\n", 
        "How timeless is love\nLove surrounding a being\nAll too fateful heart\nEvades one from seeing\nThe number of ways\nIn a number of ways\nTo change the pace of the days\nInto living breathing\nLiving breathing\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Although a heart is crying for the world\nIt understands the wounds well\nKeeping it open it bleeds\nKeeping it open it heals\n\nSometimes we are away\n...\n\n", 
        "Yes i can't deny the worn out and truthful, if it's picturesque - though\nit's just a saying, not useful - resolve that great chain of aging and\nfierce hours - so soon it becomes annoying to us - yes between her thighs it\n...\n\n", 
        "For the one my window hides in its view... - to enlighten me if my love's\nreal, or that faith - what's more bitter than the late spring - i forgot to\nlive, seated in one of their fucking trains - yes i forgot to live seated in\none of those - and when the world is left i don't need an inscription to\nremind for these things - if it's washing away, well, you know what -\n...\n\n", 
        "\"Welcome to a dramatic play bleed in these arms until the chains are broken\"\n\nAfter all there was something real\nWhen you said you still believe in what's feeling right\nDamn that misanthropy\n...\n\n", 
        "And here's enough of them for many a nightly breath\nAnd a fine shelter from the jealous too\nThe rise of an extinguished art\nHigher dreams have come to us\nAnd here's enough of them\nThe depressive season there with sceneries filled with idols\n...\n\n", 
        "So maybe I lost all youth and tender loving afterwards\nWhen I gave in wholly for that thing other and went my way\nAnd the bride's mouth tasted like the word it's called by\nBut I've always been an oppressive kind of guy\nSo maybe I lost all youth and tender loving afterwards\nWhen I gave in wholly for that thing other and went my way\nAnd the bride's mouth tasted like the word it's called by\nBut I've always been an oppressive kind of guy\nThat's right\n...\n\n",
