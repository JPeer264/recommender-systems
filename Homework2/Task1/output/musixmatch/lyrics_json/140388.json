        "My band of soaks, my den of dissolute's\nMy dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts\nMy sons of whores spend their lives in my inn,\n(nononono not tonight)\nHoming pigeons homing in\nThey fly through my doors,\nAnd they crawl out on all fours\n\nWelcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down\nAnd meet the best innkeeper in town\nAs for the rest, all of 'em crooks:\nRooking their guests and crooking the books\nSeldom do you see\nHonest men like me\nA gent of good intent\nWho's content to be\n\nMaster of the house, doling out the charm\nReady with a handshake and an open palm\nTells a saucy tale, makes a little stir\nCustomers appreciate a bon-viveur\nGlad to do a friend a favor\nDoesn't cost me to be nice\nBut nothing gets you nothing\nEverything has got a little price!\n\nMaster of the house, keeper of the zoo\nReady to relieve 'em of a sou or two\nWatering the wine, making up the weight\n...\n\n"
