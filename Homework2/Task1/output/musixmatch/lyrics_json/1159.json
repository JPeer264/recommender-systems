        "She wears a halo of ashes\nSpectre of the wind\nWaits on me so patiently\nI no longer can pretend\nSky lies a thousand miles below\nStars shine and the moon is clear\nNothing and for no one\nWon't see me if you're here\n\nI've been a long, long time away\nGot one foot in the grave\nGlorified in the dying of the sun\n\nMy angel pulls me closer\n...\n\n", 
        "Bite the thorn that pierced the skin\nCome back down to Earth again\nThe cold is creeping deep inside\nDisconnect the telephone line\n\nGot to get away, got to get away, get away\nGot to get away before the Lord calls me to stay\nAll that I know, should've been, could've been mine\n\nI killed the last way out of this\n...\n\n", 
        "Her ghost hides in my mind in the night\nIn a way she's haunting me\nI'm wanting her still\nThrough rose coloured skies\nOr blue, blue moonlight, and miracles\nI'm high as she's walking by\n\nAnd when I look at you I got a second chance\nReally need to have you now\nOne by one they fall\n...\n\n", 
        "All these dying days\nI walked the ghost town\nUsed to be my city\nI seen a holy man\nSeen him crying with the mother Mary\nAll these dying days\n\nYes, it's too late\nThis life isn't mine\nLord hear me pray\nCan you ease my mind\nNow that they're gone forever\nJesus I done gone over\nSleeping alone, you stay on your side\nIf I could lie like all of a thousand other times\n...\n\n", 
        "Take a minute just to breathe\nTake a minute till I'm wide awake\nI am searching once again\nAnd the sun has left the sky\nAnd you're on my mind, you're on my mind\n\nTake a second to believe\nJust a second, you won't have to wait\nDon't you turn your back on me\nI couldn't look into your eyes\nAnd I don't know why, and I don't know why\nBut I'll try again on another day\n...\n\n", 
        "Winter's setting in again\nAnd it feels like the end is near\nSense a sense I ain't had in long\nWatching the seconds passing by\n\nCome January, I swear this world\nWon't be the one that we once lived on\nTook an oath for a promise sworn and broken\nAll that's gone away\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's taken everything\nEverything I've got and it's hung me on a line\nWater rising up over me\nAnd I think I'm going to die, think I'm going to die\n\nI told a lie, that's what I said\nI told them one you know I'll always keep\nWhose God is mine\nWhose God is mine\nWhose God is mine\nWhose God is the one with the witness\n\nShine your lonely light on me\nI'll be there to hold the mirror\nI could take you down with me\nShow you lonely, lonely, lonely\n\n...\n\n", 
        "It's a broken morning outside\nGo easy on my mind\nBecause you're this dream I'm hanging on\nAnd I'm trying to make the dawn\n\nAnd the longest way I travelled\nFrom the darkness to the light\nLord it's been a million miles\nAnd these prisons, I can't abide\n\nI'm halfway here, I'm halfway there\nI'm halfway here, I'm halfway there\nI'm halfway here, I'm halfway there\nAnd all along I've been a traveller, yeah\n...\n\n", 
        "Born to work under the way your velvet lies\nSmoke and fog, getting hazy in the sky, arise\n\nI've been where you've never been\nI've seen what you never seen\nI've dreamed what you never dream\nI've left what you never leave\nBut now I can only find one way to take me higher\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If you want to get to Heaven let me tell you how\nKeep your hand on the Gospel plow\nHold on, hold on, hold on\n\nMary had a golden chain\nEvery link spelt Jesus' name\nHold on, hold on, hold on\nMary had a golden chain, hold on\n\nIf you want to get to Heaven let me tell you how\nKeep your hand on the Gospel plow\n\nWaking up without you now I'm on my own\n...\n\n", 
        "Can't take a train you know they move too slow\nGot to take to the airport where I want to go\nHeart beating like a million miles an hour\nListening the wind is turning sweet to sour\n\nOrange airplane\nTake me to a new day\nLittle orange airplane\nTake me to a new day\n\nI land downtown in the middle of the day\n...\n\n", 
        "Well you're the only key\nThe one that's deep inside of me\nLate at night in the pale of fright\nI wake up only to turn on the light\nYou tell me all these things\nIn the desperate creeping night\nYou tell me all these things\nWhile the darkness hides the light\n\nSeventeen colours on the back of the wall\n...\n\n", 
        "Standing by myself on the sidewalk\nNothing in this world could make me talk\nI'm nailed to this floor where there is no air\nAlone I see myself and stare\nLocked inside this world you gave me\nIt's lonely here through the smoke I can't see clear\n\nAnd I know all the ways and I'll try\nAnd I've seen all the places I get eyed\nIf I bear myself in the yard\nWould the end of the day always seem so hard\n\nWait for the world to turn around\nThen I won't go up or down\n...\n\n", 
        "Come on now I'm waiting\nNo one is walking by my side\nI believe that if I get off track\nYou've got something that can bring me back\nI go to you now and in a way you're very different somehow\n\nCome on come on let's go inside\nCome on come on go back to find\nCome on back she's asking why\nGo out into my side forever\nForever\nThere's only you forever\nForever, to the end now\nThere's only you\nThere's only you\n...\n\n", 
        "Moving slowly in the morning light\nWaiting for you to come along\nUnderstand it's time for a change\nNow I know I've got nothing to say\nLooking through me like there's no one there\nJourney to the great nowhere\n\nIf you are seeing what you're believing it's nothing new\nDon't say you're seeing what you're believing\nI've been there too, yeah\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The scene looks very empty\nHeld in front of what might be\nThe books they all want to tempt me\nAnd try to set me free\n\nAnd now I'm on the other side\nLooking back at me\nThe voices gnarl against us all\nTelling what must be\n\nAnd I see stars in the morning\nNot knowing if I'm dead\nI see stars with my eyes closed\nRemember everything you said\n\nTen years after I have read\n...\n\n", 
        "Alone in a room with shadows staring at the wall\nGot to shade my eyes for a moment try and understand it all\nDisappear I'm just a ghost left over from another day\nLost in thoughts with a lonely girl\nNever find out another way\n\n(Where are you)\n...\n\n", 
        "Were you around\nSpring came today\nOutside your room\nYou were away\nAll the lost hours spent in the cold\nI didn't care\nI dreamed you were there\nNow I'm counting my chances gone 1 2 3\nIf you see me today would you remember me\nSay you are free why don't you really live\nYou gotta hate forever never can forgive\nAnd it's clear\nI learned to trust the rain\n...\n\n", 
        "Sand on the beach beats a hole through my hand\nHands of the clock stand where I have to walk\nAll the way around\nTurn upside down\nJust look around to the turning\nEverything inside is burning\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Clairvoyance, clairvoyance\nWild into the dead of night\nAround the corner I see a light\nSee it coming my way run\nStanding on the ground waiting for the sign\n\nWhoa I can't go on I can't sleep\nI can't last more than another week\n'Cause I know what's coming then\n\n...\n\n", 
        "If you see my birds flying\nOn your way past people crying\nGive them all a wave and tell them\nThat I'm going to save some time for them\n\nIf you pass me in the square\nJust pretend that I'm not there\nJust reach over into pocket\nTake the paper and written on it's what to do\nIt's up to you, transfiguration\nHey, babe\n\nIf you think I'm taking too long\nJust imagine that I'm gone\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm burning baby, catch on fire with me\nThere's a ghost in my head\nAnd he's chasing me through my dreams\nI want to take a train today\nI'd take it straight to any place\n\nI keep on riding, keep on rolling away\nWoah yeah\n\nI'm burning baby, got no place to go\nIt's just a crawl through the weeks\n...\n\n", 
        "Yeah, I can see for miles and my time is empty\nI bounce on a wire just try and stop me [ha, ha]\nA million things I could think of today\n'Cause my mind is racing\nI want to stay and get lost in your eyes\nA canvas world when you cry, hey\n\nI'm walking down a spiral staircase\n...\n\n", 
        "Don't look down\nAs we begin to travel, mysteries unravel\nThis road just seems to twist around\nFollow me and all that sound\nDon't look down\n\nNever find the key somewhere\nSo fire traps your walking stick\nIt's served me well but now it's gone\nChanging shape and then disarm\n...\n\n", 
        "Well clouds and I see a shape\nPretty girl through the night and day\nRun around fast away\nI pass the shadows where I stay\nLong, long hair and I'm not there\nAnd when the wind dissolves the clouds\nThe street light girl is the only witness\n\nThe girl behind the mask\nShe's the one who never has to ask, yeah\n\nWith magic pouring from her eyes\nThere's nothing she can't recognise\n...\n\n", 
        "Moving around in the outer reaches\nHiding out with all creatures there\nThe dirt is drifting down upon us\nBut my friends never, never crack a frown\n\nWe're going to the poison planet\nWe're going to it now\nMoving beyond this point in time\nSeems unreal somehow\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I walk in cold rain\nWith my telescope in my hand\nI had to go 27, 000 miles with this cane\nNow it's broken into pieces\nAnd so little time remains\n\nI hear these voices in the air\nAnd I know they're just repeating\nThe language of the land\nAnd the sky that I survey\n\nI'm reciting all the verses\nPraying straight from a book beside my bed\nIt's different now I'm here\nEvery question's coming dead\n\nYeah, I've gone so many places\n...\n\n", 
        "[With bad intent]\nYeah, come on!\nCome on!\n\nThe sound of the ocean destroys the silence\nAnd he stands on the edge of the morning\nWith the rising tide that he's watching daily\nHis will is strong but his legs are failing\n\nYeah, on the pathway\n...\n\n", 
        "Winds are fake but you're over there\nDidn't sit here long inside my stare\nIn this pale blue sky you saw the error\nStrange to see how your vision narrows\n\nAn unspoken thing\nIn your ears it rings\nYou know where it's at now\n\nIf you've time for one inspection\n...\n\n", 
        "When your head has gone to bed\nTell the story just like I said\n...\n\n", 
        "Well call the doctor quick baby\nI think I'm going insane\nI get the feeling that maybe\nI'll be dying today\nPictures in my mind\nSeem so hard to find\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Sand on the beach beats a hole through my hand\nHands of the clock stand where I have to walk\nAll the way around\nTurn upside down\nJust look around to the turning\nEverything inside is burning\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Action in the ways I see today\nHold me back into the world where I can stay\nGo away so I can see you in my eye\nThe world is a panic lost in time\n\nOther worlds for us to find\nLeaving all these things behind\nSun is fire in the sky\nBurns a hole into our lives\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Stand against barriers\nThrough cruel hallways\nUp against barriers\nIn every day\nGive me another shot\nCome and let me hear you talk\nGlassy eyes I look like chalk\nCall a word and hear it mocked\nThe hands of the clock\n\nNight is a barrier\nIn dark hallways\n...\n\n", 
        "In the land where we must speak\nEvery one of us will roam\nThe birds that fly here never know\nTallest trees or windows blow\n\nNow your mind is next to mine\nInfinity leaves us behind\nNow your mind is next to mine\nWe go on down the road of time\n\n...\n\n"
