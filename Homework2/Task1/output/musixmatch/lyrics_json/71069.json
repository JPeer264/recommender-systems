        "Erin, Erin, Erin!\nErrin' across America\n\nDo now cheer me on\nCan you hear the song for you?\n\nQuick, now, caramel dip\nGive it up to the runaway ship\nHail, now, hail to the bitch\nThe hairy literary with the nervous, nervous twitch\n\nShy, your light pops out\nAnd we stand there astounded\nAnd we pound our heads and shout\n...\n\n", 
        "Feel the matress tense beneath me\nLike the muscle of nonsleepy\nFeathers flexing will defeat me\nAnd it vexes me completely\n\nAnd the hexes heat covertly\nLike a slow low-flying turkey\nLike a Texan drying jerky\nBut his meaty mitts can't hurt me\n\nWith my steely will compounded\n...\n\n", 
        "That means no\nWhere I come from\nI am cold, out waiting for the day to come\n\nI chew my lips\nAnd I scratch my nose\nFeels so good to be a rose\n\nOh don't\nDon't you lift me up\nLike I'm that shy no-no-no-no-no, just give it up\n\nOh there are bats all dissolving in a row\nInto the wishy-washy dark that cannot let go\n\nWell I cannot let go\nSo I thank the lord\nAnd I thank his sword\n...\n\n", 
        "Dear charming kite\nDo litely bite\nThe foggy fields, the lowing lanes\nThe rickety roads and the kneeling plains\n\nOh lazy light\nWith massive might\nYou down my dream of snowy cloth\nFelt snapping white as albatross\nIs bitten by the wind and rocks\nIs hushed into the clary moss\nIs ushered here to count his loss\nMy kite, pale cotton, willow cross\n\nYou take my tattered fist\nIt's like a catalyst\nIt's like a roiling, rising wall of 'Has it come to this?'\n\nIf this is medicine, whoa-oh\nIt tastes like medicine\nJust help me get it in\n\nFlying a kite, flying\nA kite, flying a\nKite, flying a kite,\nFlying a kite, flying a\nKite, flying a kite,\nFlying, flying a...\n...Kite, oh whoa-oh\n...\n\n", 
        "Autumn of the ninth inning\nAnd we drive straight through the crowd\nFirst it was what I call quiet\nThen it was biblically loud\n\nYou should have seen how they tumbled\nYou should have seen how they danced\n...\n\n", 
        "This place is damp and ghostly\nI am already gone\nAnd the halls were lined with the disembodied...\n...And dustly wings, which fell from flesh\nGasp-less-ly\n\nAnd I go where the trees are\nAnd I walk from a higher education\nFor now, and for hire\n\nIt beats me but I do not know\nIt beats me but I do not know\nIt beats me but I do not know\nI do not know\n\n...\n\n", 
        "We should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right-On's right-on, it was right-on\n\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right-On's right-on, it was right-on\n\nI killed my dinner with karate\nKick 'em in the face, taste the body\nShallow work is the work that I do\n\nDo you want to sit at my table?\nMy fighting fame is fabled\nAnd fortune finds me fit and able\n...\n\n", 
        "I slept all day\nI woke with distaste\nAnd I railed\nAnd I raved\n\nThat the difference between\nThe sprout and the bean\nIt is a golden ring\nIt is a twisted string\n\nAnd you can ask the counselor\nAnd you can ask the king\n...\n\n", 
        "Svetlana sucks lemons across from me\nAnd I am progressing abominably\nAnd I do not know my own way to the sea\nBut the saltiest sea knows its own way to me\n\nAnd the city that turns, turns protracted and slow\nAnd I find myself toeing the embarcadero\nAnd I find myself knowing the things that I knew\nWhich is all that you can know on this side of the blue\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Do you know what this is, son?\nThis is the Panopticon\nAnd all around us blink the brash\nAnd shifty eyes of common cash\n\nSo do we die or do we travel\nDown the path by which one dabbles\nIn the arts of antediluvian crafts\nWith yarn and glue?\n\n...\n\n", 
        "The tadpole buoyant as basalt\nThe seahorse horsing in assault\nThe owlet in his greenery\nThe narwhal in his cup of sea\nThey all believe\nThey all believe\n\nBut collusion bleeds through back allies\nFrom parapets that end on feet\nWhen one is weak they discreetly meet\nThey throw the bones into the street\nAnd they progress\nAnd we retreat\n\nAnd all the books our fathers wrote\nAre in the middle of the road\n...\n\n", 
        "We sailed away on a winter's day\nWith fate as malleable as clay\nBut ships are fallible, I say\nAnd the nautical, like all things, fades\nAnd I can recall our caravel\nA little wicker beetle shell\nWith four fine masts and lateen sails\nIts bearings on Cair Paravel\n\nOh, my love\n...\n\n",

        "Sadie\nWhite coat\nYou carry me home\nAnd bury this bone\nAnd take this pinecone\n\nBury this bone\nTo gnaw on it later, gnawing on the telephone\nUntil then, we pray and suspend\nThe notion that these lives do never end\n\nAnd all day long we talk about mercy\nLead me to water, Lord, I sure am thirsty\nDown in the ditch where I nearly served you\nUp in the clouds where he almost heard you\n\nAnd all that we built\nAnd all that we breathed\nAnd all that we spilt\nOr pulled up like weeds\nIs piled up in back\nAnd it burns irrevocably\n\nWe spoke up in turns\n'Til the silence crept over me\n\nAnd bless you\nAnd I deeply do\n...\n\n", 
        "Oh, where is your inflammatory writ\nYour text that would incite a light, be lit\nOur music deserving devotion unswerving\nCry \"Do I deserve her?\" with unflagging fervor\nWell, no we do not, if we cannot get over it\n\nBut what's it mean when suddenly we're spent, tell me true\nAmbition came and reared its head, and went far from you\nEven mollusks have weddings, though solemn and leaden\nBut you dirge for the dead, take no jam on your bread\nJust a supper of salt and a waltz through your empty bed\n...\n\n",

        "We speak in the store\nI'm a sensitive bore\nYou seem markedly more\nAnd I'm oozing surprise\n\nBut it's late in the day\nAnd you're well on your way\nWhat was golden went gray\nAnd I'm suddenly shy\n\nAnd the gathering floozies\nAfford to be choosy\nAnd all sneezing darkly\nIn the dimming divide\n\nAnd I have read the right book\n...\n\n", 
        "If you wanna come on down\nDown with your bones so white\nAnd watch while the freight trains pound\nInto the wild wild night\n\nHow I would love to gnaw\nGnaw on your bones so white\nAnd watch as the freight trains paw\nPaw at the wild wild night\n\nAll these ghost towns\nWreathed in old loam\nAssateague knee-\nDeep in seafoam\nHo, swansea!\nButtonwillow!\nLagunitas!\n...\n\n"
