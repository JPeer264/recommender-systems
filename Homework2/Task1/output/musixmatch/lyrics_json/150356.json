        "Time and time again, will his knowledge lead his aggression?\nYou insist on bringing home a broken child, just like you.\nIs this failure what you're grinning at?\nDon't shut the curtain.\nDon't block the view of precious portraits sending signals of grace.\nIt's the only thing left standing in the light.\nI've got nothing else, but your fire hasn't gone out just yet.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Blooming into a fight for glory, we will rise above.\nWe will rise above all else.\nThe glory for us.\nBut in the beginning we've dug this endless hole.\nHere we are, and I know we will have to work together.\nAnd in the beginning we've kept our redemption back.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
