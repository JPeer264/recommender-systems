        "Like a child I can sit in the corner\nWith these pills I can barely get by\nSo I wait for the hour of approval\nTen minutes until it's five\n\nAnd it's friday, so I don't feel so lonely\nI know the wolves are out tonight\nThe sound of ice in a bottomless glass\nTells me that all that is fine\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",

        "Tired and awake\nWrite words you really mean without mistake\nPush the pen until it doesn't work no more\nIt's empty outside the door\n\nPartially insane\nRoman candle come and guide me through the dark\nI'll be walking through the horror I once knew\nThat wasn't really much\n\nThis isn't a long catastrophe\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)",
