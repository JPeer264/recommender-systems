        "I am sad I am sorrowed\nBy all the songs we used to sing\nby all the bands we used to follow\nAnd the place we used to meet\nAnd all your things that i've borrowed\nAnd mm your smell stuck in the sheets\nAnd all the strings of this piano\nThat ring out when I touch the keys\nYou sing won't you rid me of my sorrow?\nWon't you rid me of my leads?\nWon't you tell me \u2018bout tomorrow?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care,\nBut it's so cold and I don't know where\nI brought you daffodils, in a pretty string,\nBut they won't flower like they did last spring\n\nAnd I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright,\nI'm just so tired to share my nights,\nI wanna cry and I wanna love\nbut all my tears have been used up\n\nOn another love, another love,\nAll my tears have been used up,\nOn another love, another love,\nAll my tears have been used up,\nOn another love another love,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Hard to know\nMaybe if I skim the stone\nWalk a different way back home\nIt would all make sense.\nOh, shut my eyes\nLose myself in teenage lies\nIf I fell in love a thousand times\nWould it all make sense?\n\nCause I\nI've been feeling pretty small\nSometimes\n\nFeel like I'm slipping down walls\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "Love, I have wounds\nOnly you can mend\nYou can mend.\nOh...\nI guess that's love\nI can't pretend\n\nI can't pretend.\nOh...\nFeel, my skin is rough\nBut it can be cleansed\nIt can be cleansed.\nMy arms are tough\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)", 
        "If I walk in white rivers\nWould you walk with me?\nOr if I follow white rivers\nMight I find the sea?\n\nOr if I wrote my own life\nYeah, might I find the roads\nOr if I change my old???\nWill my heart be whole\n\nOr if I gave my all\nWould you try\nAnd if I said I\u2019m strong,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
