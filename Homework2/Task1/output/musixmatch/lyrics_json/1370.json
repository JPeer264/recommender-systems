        "That we'd ever reach that point\nMany years we sailed together\nNow it's time to say goodbye\nYou don't know what I've been going through\nHaven't heard that much from you\nIsolation is a nice flower\nNow I wonder what to do\n...\n\n", 
        "Look at me - you can watch me\nListen to me - you can hear me\nTalk to me - you can yell at me\nPlay with me - you infuriate me\nLook at me - just watch me\nTry to see... - but you better not touch me\nLook at me - just watch me\nTry to see me through - but you better not touch me...\n...\n\n", 
        "...That I denied one time too many\nShe left me at the break of day\nWhen I awoke she seemed still spinning in my head\nBut she was gone, the capsule empty\nAnd her body dead\nWas all she'd left behind without a last adieu\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish I'd had the time to look into your eyes\nAnd quietly say the words\nThe words that you'd expect\nI wish I'd touched your face\nAnd you would hold my hand\nThen tears were on our guard\nAnd silence was our friend\nAnd we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes\nThe struggle and the strife and the black and white\nAnd all the letters that we wrote\nWould be printed out in gold\nIn our memories to behold\nWithout explanations\n...\n\n", 
        "we must have played\nfor more than ten years\nwe must have thought\nthat we're immortal\nshame, shame on us,\nah little hussy,\nwhat did you think i was\ni look at us\nwe have grown older\na lot too much\nfor me to take\ni thought\nwe were immortal\n...\n\n", 
        "Sometimes it seems the night will last forever\nSometimes it seems that darkness always falls\nA dark star woke you up and with a dark star\nYou go to bed\nYou're sinking slowly into the deep\nYou wonder if you ever touch the ground\nWhere you would walk through sparkling spheres,\nOn strangest drugs and without fears\nYou feel just like a little girl\nAnd all your dreams lie frozen on the moon\nYou left them ther some time ago\n...\n\n", 
        "I haven't been very good\nFor some time but now I listen to the music once again\nTo bowie and the petshop boys\nGetting better as the music's getting back to my head\nWhen the moon has turned the blood\nAt the end of the world\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to live in the greyness of life\nLike a parrot in a flock of crows\nBetter put on my gold-feathered cloak\nAnd walk out into the cold\nAnd since I was a kid I shone so much from inside out\nLike San Sebastian on prime time TV\nAnd I sigh when I look at all the good things around\nAll those untold treasures\nAnd unmeasured pleasures\nI'd like to be like no other honeybee\nSucking on the sweet, sweet flower\nAnd when the sun goes down I got the power to fly...\nAnd that is the only feeling,\nThe one and only chance to get away\nFrom anything that hurts\n...\n\n", 
        "The rain against the windshield endlessly\nFor many years i cruised around the world\nI've finally disembarked my ship of fools\nA hero then, a stranger to return\nI'd trade my goldrush 'gainst your silvernets\nTo know what happened after all this time\nAnd in your arms i'm lost forevermore\nI wonder how you ever felt in mine\nIsn't it strange, i still can hear your call\nIsn't it strange, i'm not a ghost at all\nIsn't it strange or is it just insane\n...\n\n"
