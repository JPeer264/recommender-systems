        "It ain't that easy\nWhen you wake up\nLooking at the mirror you realize\nYou've lost that brightness in your eyes\n\nBut you feel\nThe same as yesterday\nWhen your arms were too short\nTo embrace your life alone\n\nIt's a bad day\nCause you're still waiting\nFor the call you're used to\nExpecting them to tell you\nWhat's right and what's wrong\n\nBut this time it won't come\nThis time you're alone\nAnd the world outside\nWill never shine for you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209672)",
