        "A song within a song\nYou get lost I go wrong\nWe cross dissolving into music or oblong\nAnd I think that it's easier if I drink\nSo I drink to your dream way off beam\nWay off in the past\nAnd I'm cast far away\n\nEvery Sunday\nMy world in one day\nMy moon and my someday\n...\n\n", 
        "Is it strained, when I call you\nOr do you think, that I might forget\nOh your love, is radiating\nThe farther away\nI go\nI go\n\nDo you count, on me now\nAnd do you wait, up for me all night\nI wish I could run, to you when you need me\nYou know I can't be far\n...\n\n", 
        "You say your time is over\nYou seek but never find\nAnd the cold wind on your shoulder\nA storm inside your mind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Wish\nI wish it was that way\nThe way it used to be\n...\n\n"
