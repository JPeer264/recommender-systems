        "I've never heard the voice of god,\nI've found no trace of heaven either.\nSince I was spared in hell I repay the old chaplain that saved me.\nI spend my days with the good book,\nfollow every chapter, prayer and verse.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
