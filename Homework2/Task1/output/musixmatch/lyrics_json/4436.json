        "Thirty years since all this happened,\nThirty years it took to rise\nBlood on the floor and in their eyes,\nThey took the bite and left them to die\n\nThirty years and now I'm here\nThe only one left to scream in fear,\nYour job means nothing when I got you running\naway with blood in your tears\n\nTake a look at me can you see the death in my eyes,\nAll the time you're waiting I get\nStronger with power and force!\nIts not as if they're paying you much\n\nIn Five nights at Freddy's 3,\nI'll hunt you down then you will see\nYou'll burn alive, when you hit night 5,\nThat's life in Five nights at Freddy's 3,\nA horror ride built just for me,\nYour doom is near your time comes now,\nYou're just too late\nI'm coming for you now!\n\nAll these toys yet not much time,\nBefore I take your soul tonight,\nPiece by piece I build your fears,\n...\n\n",
