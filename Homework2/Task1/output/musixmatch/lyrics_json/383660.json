        "If I could buy you anything I wanted this Christmas\nI would get the Academy to give you an Oscar for your script\nEven though you haven't built a single set\nI know it's my favorite movie yet.\nWell, I don't have any money\nAnd I won't have any soon\nI could be like Mata Hari and seduce and oil tycoon\nHe would give me a million pounds in a big suitcase\nYou and I would have our first Christmas in space\nSpace Christmas\nSpace Christmas\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "When I feel kinda like a giant useless slump\nReady to be taken to the rubbish dump\nYou call me up on your red telephone\nMake me happy again and then you have to go\n\nBut I've been trying to think positively\nAbout taking up new activities\nI'll do yoga and learn Chinese\nPlay accordion and eat my peas\n\nBut will you spend New Year's Eve with me?\nWe can hide in my bedroom and watch cartoons all night\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "When my baby kisses me, it's like honey to a bee\nAnd when my baby holds my hand\nIt's like heaven on land\nBut baby don't dance\nBaby is a punk rocker\n\nBut in my head, you're Patrick Swayze\nYou grab from the corner and call me baby\nBut baby, you don't even want to see Dirty Dancing\nBaby is a punk rocker\n\nI like to learn about the things that really matter to my baby\nBlack Flag and Fugazi\nBad Religion and Misfits are great\nBut can we go where only eagles dare?\nHenry Rollins don't dance\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Do you remember that photo\nThe one you took with an instant Polaroid?\nI didn't know that you had it\nI didn't know you could get that film anymore\n\nWe both looked so happy\nLike it was 1973\nThe color faded like my memory\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
