        "Tell me you love me\nTell me that you're mine again\nTell me you won't turn away\nTurn like the seasons\nTurn back to me once again\nCircling all the way\n\nOnce you were my blue eyed prince\nWaking love from an endless sleep\nYou made all of my wishes come true\nTurning all of my dreams into you\n\nTurning and swirling and whirling 'round you again\nTwirling and curling 'round you\nTurning and burning and yearning for you again\nAll my life with you\n\n...\n\n"
