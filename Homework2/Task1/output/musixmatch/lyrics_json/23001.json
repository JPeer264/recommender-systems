        "When I'm alone, and thinkin' of death\nThinkin' about the world and when it will end\nThinkin' of what is accepted and accepted as true\nThey're all just fuckin' lies!\nAWARE! BEWARE! WAR! The war that is so come\nThe beast in man has been caged far too long\nNo longer are we the wild wolves of old\nThe cross has taken our talons and taken our soul\nThe Eternal Glory Of War\nThis song is a stab to the hearts\nOf those who would have us feel guilty for our past\nFuck all this remorse and fuckin' regret\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
