        "By the rivers of Babylon\nWhere he sat down\nAnd there he wept\nWhen he remembered Zion\n\nCause, the wicked carried us away in captivity\nRequired from us a song\nHow can we sing King Alpha's song\n\nIn a strange land?\n\nCause, the wicked carried us away in captivity\n...\n\n", 
        "I could feel these trills walking over\nWhen you held me tight\nNow I feel those pain taking over\nWhen you said goodnight\n\nOh, what sweet sensation\n...\n\n", 
        "I'll love you like I want you\nAnd I'll kiss you like I need you\nEvery night\n\nI'll draw you close to me\nI'll tell you words of comfort\nIt's my delight\n\nDarling, I've grown to love you, more every day\nAnd I've got a song to sing\nEach lonely night, oh yeah, oh yeah\n\nIt's stronger than the north winds\nHigher than the mountains\nThat's my love for you\n\nAnd I will never hurt you\n...\n\n", 
        "I could feel these trills walking over\nWhen you held me tight\nNow I feel those pain taking over\nWhen you said goodnight\n\nOh, what sweet sensation\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't believe you want to leave so soon\nThe party's just begun now, don't go away\nThe music is sweet for your dancin' pleasure\nBaby, has no measure\n\nSwing and dine and dance for your money\nSwing and dine and dance for your money\nSwing and dine and dance for your money\nSwing and dine and dance for your money\n\nPlease Mr. DJ, play this song for me\n...\n\n"
