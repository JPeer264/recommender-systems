        "In the sunlight of your smile\nIn the summer of our life\nIn the magic of love\nStorms above scattered away\n\nLovers dreaming in the night\nReaching for paradise\nBut as the dark shadows fade\nLove slips away\n\nOn an empty stretch of beach\nIn the pattern of the waves\nDrawing pictures with my hand\nIn the sand, I see your face\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613233796)"
