        "My family on the right hand side\nAnd your family on the left\nWe got married in a single bed\nWe sang shaker hymns\nWhen your warhorse grandfather had sung\n...\n\n", 
        "Like faithful oxen through the chalk,\nWith dragging tails of history walk.\nSoon confuse the compass and the cross.\nCarefully and cursively we fill our traveling diaries with loss.\nBeneath an angry Bible flood,\nDid you and I first learn to love.\nIn my father's car we came to know.\nAnd shivered in our painted clothes and paired like every animal below.\nAs heavy as a history book can be,\nI will carry it with me, oh Lord.\nAnd maybe when the bitterness has gone,\n...\n\n", 
        "You've made your decision\nNow get up and leave\nThe familiar sting of the woodcutter's swing to the tree\n\nI'll fall in the forest\nTo elbows and knees\nAnd it won't make a sound\nSince there's no-one around here to see\n\nI was prepared to love you\nAnd never expect anything of you\n\nIf the spirit has left you baby\n...\n\n", 
        "Like a seed in the earth waiting with bated breath is ... ... (?)\nAll the months in the north that don't get light at all, lonely all year round\nHow did I fall so far from the family tree?\nWhy did you follow when you saw what happened to me?\n\nLover, your momma\nWill worry half to death, the day break\n\nYou give yourself to love like a wild animal, delivered from the plains\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to be a king alone\nLike Solomon or Rehoboam\nAnd in the eaves the corvidae\ndid jealous keep my picture frames\nand everything did oxidate in place\n\nBut then you came, a single cell\nwith astrolabe and carousel\nand algebra and symmetry\nand none of this was lost on me\nand I could see how still I'd been before\n...\n\n", 
        "I waited by your bedside,\nAnd didn't close my eyes all night.\nI named you like a prayer.\n\nIt's anybody's guess how,\nThe angel of doubt came down,\nAnd crept into your bed.\n\nBut after we danced to the shipping forecast,\nThe words escaped your mouth:\n\"I know it's gotta stop love, but I don't know how.\"\n\nNow the stairs forget your shoes,\nAnd the gate don't creak for want of you.\n...\n\n", 
        "Night descended\nLike a blanket on a house,\nWhere I miss you, like a limb,\nI close the curtains, shun the working and I,\nPut your record on,\nI put your record on\n\nOooh-oooh \n\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to be a king alone\nLike Solomon or Rehoboam\nAnd in the eaves the corvidae\ndid jealous keep my picture frames\nand everything did oxidate in place\n\nBut then you came, a single cell\nwith astrolabe and carousel\nand algebra and symmetry\nand none of this was lost on me\nand I could see how still I'd been before\n...\n\n", 
        "On this little cold parcel of land\nwhere our father's fathers lived\nThe same old trees scraping innocently\nsince our grandparents were kids.\nYou were born in a terrible storm\nand your Ma said \"It's a sign.\"\nYou're never at peace with your bed facing east\nand your itchy feet like mine.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I used to be a king alone\nLike Solomon or Rehoboam\nAnd in the eaves the corvidae\ndid jealous keep my picture frames\nand everything did oxidate in place\n\nBut then you came, a single cell\nwith astrolabe and carousel\nand algebra and symmetry\nand none of this was lost on me\nand I could see how still I'd been before\n...\n\n", 
        "You are the string in my bow.\nBiblical Mary to Joe.\nThe North isn't True 'til it's leading me to you.\nYou are the way that I know.\n...\n\n", 
        "Lo and behold your mother is drinking again.\nThis might be the coldest winter since records began.\nYou were a low moon, steady with wintry calm.\nLeading the children softly across the farm.\n\nEach morning you'd march your sisters like soldiers to school.\nCuz lo and behold your father had drunk all the fuel.\n...\n\n", 
        "Night descended\nLike a blanket on a house,\nWhere I miss you, like a limb,\nI close the curtains, shun the working and I,\nPut your record on,\nI put your record on\n\nOooh-oooh\n...\n\n"
