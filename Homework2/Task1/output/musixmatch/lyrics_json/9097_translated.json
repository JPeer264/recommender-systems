        "Da, da, da, da, da, da, my man\nDa, da, da, da, da, da, 'cause I love him\nDa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da\n\nMy man I love him so, he'll never know\nAll my life is just this prayer but I don't care\nWhen he takes me in his arms\nThe world is bright, alright\n...\n\n", 
        "If you go away On this summer day\nThen you might as well Take the sun away\nAll the birds that flew In the summer sky\nWhen our love was new And our hearts were high\nWhen the day was young And the night was long\nAnd the moon stood still For the night bird's song\n\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\n\nBut if you stay I'll make you a day\nLike no day has been Or will be again\nWe'll sail the sun We'll ride on the rain\n...\n\n", 
        "Frank Sinatra - What Now My Love \n\nWhat Now My Love, now that you've left me, how can I live through another day\nWatching my dreams turn to ashes, and my hopes turn to bits of clay\n...\n\n", 
        "the summer smiles\n The Summer Knows\n and unashamed\n she sheds her clothes\nthe summer smoothes\n the restless sky\n and lovingly\n she warms the sand\n on which you lie\n\n The Summer Knows\n the summer's wise\n she sees the doubts\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday when I was young\nThe taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue\nI teased at life as if it were a foolish game\nThe way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame\nThe thousand dreams I dreamed\nThe splendid things I planned I always built, alas\nOn weak and shifting sand\n\nI lived by night and shunned the naked light of day\nAnd only now I see how the years ran away\n\nYesterday\n...\n\n", 
        "Where do I begin\nTo tell the story of how great a love can be?\nThe sweet love story that is older than the sea\nThe simple truth about the love he brings to me\nWhere do I start?\n\nWith his first hello\nHe gave a meaning to this empty world of mine\n...\n\n", 
        "My man...\n'Cause I love him...\n\nOh my man\nI love him so\nHe'll never know\nAll my life is just despair\nBut I don't care\nWhen he takes me in his arms\nThe world is bright\nAll right\n...\n\n", 
        "If you go away On this summer day\nThen you might as well Take the sun away\nAll the birds that flew In the summer sky\nWhen our love was new And our hearts were high\nWhen the day was young And the night was long\nAnd the moon stood still For the night bird's song\n\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\n\nBut if you stay I'll make you a day\nLike no day has been Or will be again\nWe'll sail the sun We'll ride on the rain\n...\n\n", 
        "What now my love? Now that you left me\nHow can I live through another day?\nWatching my dreams turning to ashes\nAnd my hopes into bits of clay\nOnce I could see, once I could feel\nNow I am numb, I've become unreal\n...\n\n", 
        "The summer smiles, the summer knows\nAnd unashamed she sheds so close\nThe summer smooth, the restless kind\nAnd lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie\n\nThe summer knows, the summer's wise\nShe sees the doubt within your eyes\n...\n\n", 
        "I wish you bluebirds in the spring\nTo give your heart a song to sing\nAnd then a kiss but more than this\nI wish you love\nAnd in July, a lemonade\nTo cool you in some leafy glade\nI wish you health and more than wealth\n...\n\n", 
        "Yesterday when I was young\nThe taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue\nI teased at life as if it were a foolish game\nThe way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame\nThe thousand dreams I dreamed\nThe splendid things I planned I always built, alas\nOn weak and shifting sand\n\nI lived by night and shunned the naked light of day\nAnd only now I see how the years ran away\n\nYesterday\n...\n\n",
