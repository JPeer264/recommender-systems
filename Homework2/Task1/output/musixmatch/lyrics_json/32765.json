        "Another two months on the road\nJust two more miles and I'll be home to what I know\nWhere things move a little slower\nAnd people always wave goodbye and say hello\nAnd the maples on this road\nThey must be 300 years old\nJust imagine all the stories they could tell\nOf the tractors and the cars\nAll comin home from Liston's Bar\nAnd the country folk just out to raise some hell\nTo raise some hell\n\nThis is my home\nThis is where I belong\nWhere my daughter's go to school\nWhere opinions are strong\n...\n\n", 
        "If I could walk on water like jesus did before\nIf I knew all the answers to keep you coming back for more\nIf I could paint a picture and then cut off my own ear\nIf I chose all the right colors would this just dissapear?\n\nBecause we're running in vicious circles\nUntil we're dizzy with disdain\nand there's miles and miles between us\nYet we still remain\n\nSo if I could write a poem and find the perfect words\n...\n\n", 
        "Now, I grew up down an old dirt road\nIn a town you wouldn't know\nMy pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks\nBack in nineteen sixty-four\nMy grandfather was a drinker\nBack in the day, he put 'em down\nBut a war is known to change a man\nAnd the whiskey's known to change a man\n\nThat's not me\nI rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed\nI still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go\nIn a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road\nAnd a country boy is all I'll ever be\n\nNow it's been twelve years since I sold my soul\nTo the devil in L.A.\nHe said, sign here on the dotted line\nAnd your songs they all will play\n...\n\n", 
        "In my world\nThe shelter from the rain\nYou're the pills\nThen take away my pain\nYou're the fire\nThen warms me when I'm cold\nYou're the hand\nTo hold as I grow old\n\nIn a world\nWhere nothing else is true\n...\n\n", 
        "I sit here on the stairs and listen to\nThe night time as the daylight fades away\nIt's such a haunting and familiar tune\nAnd when I hear it in the distance I can say\nThat I'm home\nIn Massachusetts\nWhere my daughters and my wife they wait for me\nAll alone\nBut the truth is\nIt's where I always am\nIt's where I long to be\nBecause I'm home\nThe north shore is where my father lives\nI wear my red sox hat around the world with pride\nBut the Berkshires are where my heart is\nAnd when I see them in the distance I could cry\n...\n\n",
