        "I've found my way back home\nEverythings gone and changed\nBut me\nI wanna play back\nEvery word and sound\nTo show you\nI wanna real life\nTill I broke away\nFrom here\nUntil I feel it\nI feel nothin at all\n\nAnd I'm tellin you I'm sorry\nEverything has changed\nAnd I'm tellin you I'm sorry\nNothing I can do\n...\n\n", 
        "I hear voices in my head\nThey council me\nThey understand\nThey tell me things that I will do\nThey show me things I'll do to you\nThey talk to me, they talk to me\n\nYou got your rules and your religion\nAll designed to keep you safe\nBut when rules start getting broken\nYou start questioning your faith\n...\n\n", 
        "I know you know\nJust what I am\nIt tears me up\nAnd I can't stand up on my own\nMy legs are dead\nI cannot mend\nIt's killing me\n\nI've felt so numb beneath the surface\nThe walls grow dim and I can't breath\nMy hands are tied I cannot feel\nI hear it over and over again\n...\n\n", 
        "Fate\nIt never followed me\nUntil now, I never wanted it to\nTake me, I'm caving\nI always wanted it to\nSave me, I'm waiting\nI wanted everything and now\nYou gave it away and I've come undone\nThinking of you, I can't let it go\nYou took it away now I've become\nEmpty, waiting for you to pull me up\nSo\nYou came back underrated\nIt feels like I always wanted you to\nFace me, I'm caving\n...\n\n", 
        "I justa wanna let you know Im feeling numb\nAnd I never wanted to believe\nEverytime the rain comes down I feel the way\nI wish you dont push the clouds away\n\nI dont wanted, I just needed\nEver let you know\n\nI cant let you drown, I dont wanna watch you fade\nIll take it back if I could find away\nI keep into yourself, theres nothing left to say\nIll take it back if I could find away\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't deny it, I fucking like it\nIt brings the confidence and courage that I lost\nI turn into it, it helps me through it\nI lie awake and contemplate it all\nYou can't break me\n...\n\n", 
        "Pain troubles me\nFilled up it lives in here\nCold air I breathe\nFull of mistakes I've made\nStay back\nIt's out of our hands\nTry too hard\nTry too understand\nIt's out of our hands\nThere's nothing to hide\nWe're helpless and this world is never changing\nAnd all that we had is turning to gray\nCrossed apathy\nCrawled up, I feel like hell\n...\n\n", 
        "After\nAfter all\nWe are the same as we always were\nWe cover and carry on\nLike everything's copasetic and\nCourage we felt at all\nFeels like failure overcome\n\nSometimes I feel like I can't wake up\nI'm trying to breathe\nI wanna let go\nSo I can feel again\nI break up\nI'm trying to see\nIf I can let go and feel again\n\n...\n\n", 
        "There's nothing left to give\nThere's nothing left to prove\nThere's nothing we can say\nWe've counted every word\nLike stars and all the moons\nWe've buried them away\n...\n\n", 
        "I don't know why I'm\nSo caught up in covering up the past\nAfter all this time I,\nI thought I would be over you at last\nBut it kills me at night\nI was hoping you'd give me a second chance\nBut I'm leaving it up to you\nLeaving it up to you\nAnd there's nothing that I can do\nCause I walked away when I said I'd stay\nWith you\nNo excuses so\nI thought I'd make it better as I go\nIf I could go back in time I,\n...\n\n", 
        "Your voice is killing me\nYour words are hard as they come\nThoughts that sit in here\nFall like bullets to the floor\n\nYour heart is pulling me\nThe cut runs deeper as it flows\nScars that cannot heal\nThe hurt is covered to the bone\n\n'Cause every time, it gets so complicated\nWhile I'm lying down in doubt\nI'll just tell myself I'm leaving here\n'Cause I'm selfish and I'm cold\n\nAnd I feel like the world is ending\nI'm selfish and I'm cold again\n'Cause I'm selfish and I'm cold\nAnd I feel like the world is ending\n...\n\n", 
        "Is this what you wanted\nYou got what you needed\nAll that's mine\nTake it or leave it (take it or leave it)\nEverything's even but what's left of my life\nEverything's wrong\nI know\nI can see it in your eyes again\nTaking control\nOf my soul and my life\n'Cause you take away\nYou take away\nWhat more can you take\nIt feels like I've been here before\nAll that you do\nSeems to abuse\nYou won't cut me anymore\nI'm bruised and I'm bleeding (I'm bruised and I'm bleeding)\n...\n\n", 
        "Fate\nIt never followed me\nUntil now, I never wanted it to\nTake me, I'm caving\nI always wanted it to\nSave me, I'm waiting\nI wanted everything and now\nYou gave it away and I've come undone\nThinking of you, I can't let it go\nYou took it away now I've become\nEmpty, waiting for you to pull me up\nSo\nYou came back underrated\nIt feels like I always wanted you to\nFace me, I'm caving\n...\n\n", 
        "I can't deny it, I fucking like it\nIt brings the confidence and courage that I lost\nI turn into it, it helps me through it\nI lie awake and contemplate it all\nYou can't break me\n...\n\n", 
        "This is the last time I'll wait, I forced my self here\nListened to all I can take\n(I try and cut you away)\nI still remember the fall out that can't be erased\n(and bite my tongue now)\nI can't believe all the ways that you hold me\nI break\nThis is the world that you burn\n...\n\n", 
        "Covered the skin but I can't still feel\nThe ways you left me for dead\nUncover the sin to let the scars reveal\nThe blood that flowed from me\nOver the line sun burns like fire\nAnd this is all in my head\nThe pressure pushed me\nOver the line\nHeld it within cause you couldn't\nJust be perfect for everyone\n...\n\n"
