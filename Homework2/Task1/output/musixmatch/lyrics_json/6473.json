        "I'm riding the wind, don't need your request\nYou'd never invite me but I will be your guest\nOh no, no don't be afraid of the reaper\nIt's time to go I call your name and you follow, fly with me\nTake a look around and say you love me\nAnd I will guide you through the golden door\nFor everything you'll see there is a reason\nThe big wheel is turning like always before\nThere is no return from the other side of heaven\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613214354)"
