        "Heart breaker, soul shaker\nI've been told about you\nSteamroller, midnight stroller\nWhat they've been saying must be true\n\nRed-hot mama\nVelvet charmer\nTime's come to pay your dues\n\nNow you're messin' with a\nA son of a bitch\nNow you're messin' with a son of a bitch\nNow you're messin' with a\nA son of a bitch\nNow you're messin' with a son of a bitch\n\nTalkin' jivey, poison ivy\nYou ain't gonna cling to me\nMan taker, born faker\nI ain't so blind I can't see\n\nRed-hot mama\n...\n\n", 
        "Since you came into my life\nIt's the same old situation\nEmpty days and lonely nights\nFilled with bitterness and frustration.\n\nWalking lonely in the cold\nTrying to find the answer\nSpend my money on a crystal ball\nAnd the charms of a gypsy dancer\nTrying to break the spell you hold on me.\n\nChorus:\nYou're miss misery\nThat song you lay on me\nSet me free, set me free\n...\n\n", 
        "When I was younger, I used to understand\nThat when you're with a girl, you gotta act like a man\nMama told me that's the way it should be\nAnd I know my mama never lied to me.\n\nWhat do you think about you're changin' times\n'Cause when I'm with you, I just can't make up my mind\nSince I met you, don't know right from wrong\nSomebody tell me just what's goin' on.\n\nJust can't get myself thinkin' straight\nI'm all shook up and in a terrible state\n...\n\n", 
        "If this is heaven, then I'm in hell\nIf trust is misfortune, then wish me well\n\nWhile I think of sadness, baby\nYour light shines through\nYour light shines through\nYour light shines through\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause it's beggar's day\nBecause it's beggar's day\nBecause it's beggar's day\n\n...\n\n",

        "Close up the bar\nYou know the gates of the brewery\nShe's out there every night\nAnd she sure ain't drinkin' tea\nI love that woman\nShe's the best one that I had\nBut she's got this habit now\nAnd it sure is gettin' bad.\n\nThat whiskey drinkin' woman\nIs makin' a poor man out of me.\n\nShe's got bottles in the kitchen\nEven got them in my bed\nMost times I see her now\nShe's three parts out of her head\nDon't know where I went wrong\n...\n\n", 
        "Please don't Judas me\nTreat me, as you'd like to be treated\nPlease don't blacklist me\nLeave me, as you'd wish to find me\nDon't analyse me\nSacrifice me\nPlease don't Judas me.\n\nPlease don't chastise me\nShow me just one shred of kindness\nTry to help me see\nGuide me in my eyes of blindness\n...\n\n", 
        "You can have girls and girls\nYou can have boys and boys\nYou can have sex and violence\nYou can have space age toys\nYou can have anything that you think will fit\nAs long as it's box office, as long as it's a hit\n\nCinema, cinema\n\nYou can have birdmen and snowmen\nYou can have women in red\n...\n\n", 
        "See the girl with the changing faces\nSee the boy with the aching smile\nEmpty love's burned out traces\nSee them walking down midnight mile\nJuliet look what love has done to you\nJuliet love has made a fool of you\nWatch them dancing on a frozen ocean\n...\n\n", 
        "Who took the smile out of your face\nWho put the tears and sadness in its place\nWho took the sun out of your sky\nDon't turn around or ask for reasons why\nNo place to run, nowhere to hide\nIt's just another love turned bad\nSome smoke that's gettin' in your eyes\n\nIt's just another heartache, just another heartache\nJust another hurt to take\n...\n\n", 
        "I say black and you say white\nI turn to the left, you move to the right\nNo matter what I do\nI'm always on the other side of you\nI'm always on the other side of you\n\nI want to play but you like to fight\nI rise in the morning, you hide in the night\n...\n\n", 
        "Why don't you tell me that it's over\nWhy do you keep this hangin' on\nPack up your bags and run for cover\nSay what you mean and see it done\n\nWhy don't you cut me loose, you don't need me\nLift up your dress and walk away\nThere's nothin' left you can say to please me\nYou're just a dog who's had it's day\n\nYou beat around the bush and mumble\n...\n\n", 
        "I've seen that girl before, I've seen the boys come and go\nAnd still she's on her own\nI've seen those tears before, I've seen her heart break\nShe knows what it means to be alone\n\nThere must be another way to spend her life\nWhile she is waiting\n\nShe knows the dangers there, these love affairs\n...\n\n", 
        "Hey sailor, what you think, hey buy a girl a drink\nThat was the first thing she said to me\nI was on dry land but I was back at sea\nShe was so pretty but she was so mean\nC'mon boys, I'm sure you've been\n\nchorus:\n\nNa, na, na, na, na salty salty\nNa, na, na, na, na salty salty\n...\n\n", 
        "Send him to the fields, send him to the wars\nSend him on down to slave on the farms\nSteal his land, rob his soul\nSend him on down to dig that hole\n\nGive him no hope, give him no trial\nPut him in chains, break that smile\nPull that barge, tote that bale\nListen to him singin', hear him wail\n\nYou wouldn't do that to a whiteboy\n...\n\n", 
        "The bars are crowded with wasted youth\nYou just went, you didn't know the truth\nYou don't know that kid when you look back\nYou remember the music, paint it black\n\nYou had a brother in the movement and he burned his card\nHe's got a job in the white house, ain't life hard\nYou came back a hero on a stolen horse\n...\n\n", 
        "This one right here\nGoes out to everybody\nAnd it doesn't matter who you are\n'cause I know that everybody\nHas a friend (friend)\n\nWhat defines a friend\nThe meaning where does it lie?\nIn the mind\nIn the money\nIn the face\nIn in the eyes\nIn the days and the nights\nWell what is a friend\nDo you love it and leave it\nAgain and again?\nNow our story begins\nOf two little friends\nYou would've thought they were twins\nWould've thought they was kin\nWouldn't think they could manage\nAll the time they would spend\nFor each other they'd fend\nFor their friends till the end\nAnd their mothers know mothers\nSisters know brothers\nMothers know fathers\nSons know their daughters\nBlood thicker than water\nIf one had 50 cents\nThey'd both have a quarter\nIt only makes sense\nThat destined love was in order\nThey grew up together\nFrom pre-K to high school\nWinters in the snow\nSummers in the pool\nHe's an athlete\nShe's an actress\nBut hormones would lead them to the mattress\n\n[Chorus]\nI thought you were my friend (friend)\n...\n\n",

        "Another bridge I have burned\nA lesson I learned\nOne more mistake to my cause\nOne more hand got lost\nIn a game.\n\nSo I was up for awhile\nLivin' in style\nFeelin' high on the hog\nAnd people just don't wanna know\nI was down.\n\nNow some say I lost\n...\n\n",
