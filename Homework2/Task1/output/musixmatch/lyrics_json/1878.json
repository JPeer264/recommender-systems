        "Bells will be ringing\nThe glad, glad news\nOh, what a christmas\nTo have the blues\nMy baby's gone\nI have no friends\nTo wish me greetings\nOnce again\n\nChoirs will be singing\n\"silent night\"\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Our day will come and we'll have everything\nWe'll share the joys falling in love can bring\nNo one can tell me that I'm too young to know\nI love you so and you love me\n\nOur day will come, If we just wait awhile\nNo tears for us, Think love and wear a smile\nOur dreams have magic because we'll always stay\nIn love this way, Our day will come\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)", 
        "Won't you go away (little girl)\nWish you wouldn't stay (little girl)\nWon't you go away (little girl)\nWooo ooo go away.\n\nGo away little girl\nGo away little girl\nI'm not supposed to be alone with you\nOh yes I know that your lips are sweet\nBut our lips must never meet\nI belong to somebody else and I must be true.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409613209382)",
