        "Justice League\nYou been on the run around\nAnother night, another town\nA little weak, he put you down\nUntil you fell and hit the ground\nSo you went around the block again\nAnother man, another friend\nThe little lies you tell yourself\nTo better sleep, but they never help\n\nSo you click your black heels three times\nBut you never get home\nYou're still there, in his bed\nFeeling dirty and alone!\nYou toss and turn cause\nYou know you don't belong\nLost inside this lonely fairytale gone wrong\n\nSo you wanna runaway\nYou always wanna runaway\nYou always wanna runaway\nHey, hey, hey\nYou don't wanna be alone\n...\n\n", 
        "A nigga hustle around the streets to keep the paper straight\nLegal or illegal, I do what it take\nShawty she the shit, you know she put it down\nMake a nigga always wanna be around\nI blow that paper in La Perla then rip the shit when we at it\nFor her I'm a fanatic, I happen to be her habit\nWe have the same temperament, hell yeah when we're intimate\nBlindfolds, butterflies, BDSM and restraints\n50 shades of 50, yeah, we freaky when ya ain't\nLights off, she get erotic with glow in the dark paint\nI'm like give it to me baby, she know how I like it, boy\nO-D-B, baby, I like it raw\n\nYesterday was your birthday\nSo I had to put it down in the worst way\nPut the cake on your plate, then I let you eat the whole damn thing\nYeah last night was one to remember, I'm sure you'd agree\nHad such a good time, felt like I was celebrating me\n...\n\n", 
        "Thought you were just another Romeo\nThe shoe you pass by in the store window\nBut soon as I got home I wish I bought you instead\nI got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red\nNo other man has ever, ever had quite this effect\nI sleep alone cause there's no room in my bed\nFor any other lover, you're no good to my head\nYour kisses hold me hostage\nAnd I don't wanna stop it\n\nCause I only wanna give it to you\nAnd I want you more than a new pair of shoes\nI only wanna give it to you\nAnd I sure do hope that you feel like I do\n...\n\n", 
        "I feel like the girl at the bar\nWho's been there too long, can't stand up\nI should be gone\nBut I just can't get enough, yeah\n\nFumbling, giggling, silly as ever\nI get like this after one too many\nBut right now I ain't even been drinking\nHe approached me and asked for a minute\n\nWhich turned into five, then turned into ten\nAnd right now I don't know how to say when\n\nSo can I get a refill\nCan I get a refill, can I get a refill\nYeah, of your time\n'Cause you're intoxicating my mind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "[Verse 1:]\nI can't help being depressed\nWhen I look down at my chest\nOh yes, my chest it might as well be nonexistent\nHow can I ever compete With 34 double D's?\n\nAnd I'm rollin my eyes\nWhen I look down at my thighs\nThey might as well tape everything that I eat,\nTo my legs.\nI am too broke for the knife\nToo lazy to excercise\nBut if I had hazel eyes\nMaybe I could be fly.\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf I had no cellulite\nBig breasts and pockets real wide\nThen maybe I\nMaybe I, I,\nI could be so fly.\nAnd if I had a small waist\nI'd make the boys go insane\nAnd maybe I\nMaybe I, I,\nI could be so fly.\nSo fly [x3]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nNow listen\n...\n\n"
