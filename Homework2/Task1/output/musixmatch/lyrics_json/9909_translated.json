        "At last\nMy love has come along\nMy lonely days are over\nAnd life is like a song\n\nAt last\nThe skies above are blue\nMy heart\nWas wrapped in clover\nThe night I looked at you\n\nI found a dream\nThat I could speak to\nA dream that I\nCan call my own\n...\n\n", 
        "Some folks like to get away\nTake a holiday from the neighbourhood\nHop a flight to Miami Beach\nOr to Hollywood\nI'm taking a Greyhound\nOn the Hudson River Line\nI'm in a New York state of mind\n\nI've seen all the movie stars\nIn their fancy cars and their limousines\nBeen high in the Rockies under the evergreens\nI know what I'm needing\nI don't want to waste more time\nI'm in a New York state of mind\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time\nIn thinking such a thing could be\nThat you could ever care for me\nI'm sure you hate to hear\nThat I adore you, dear\nBut grant me\nJust the same\n...\n\n", 
        "Before you walked into my life\nBaby I was lost\nI never dreamed that fate had planned a time\nFor our love to cross\nNo wheel of fortune stopped by chance\nCould have lead to this romance\nFalling in love with you\n\nWas by design\nOur love was meant to be, destiny\nEverything we're feeling here tonight\nWas by design,\nPart of the master plan, Take my hand\nYou and I will spend our lives together.\n\nThe shadows of our past all fade\nWhen I'm lying next to you\n...\n\n", 
        "The very thought of you\nAnd I forget to do\nThose little ordinary things\nThat everyone ought to do\nI'm feeling in a sort of daydream\nI'm happy as a king\nAnd funny though it may seem\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm not feeling like I usually do\nI think it might have something\nTo do with you\nEvery time you're near me\nMy body gets hot\nDon't need a doctor\nI know what I've got\n\nCaught a touch of your love\nIt came on overnight\n...\n\n", 
        "Someone screwed up about half past night\nWish I'd been up I could've had a blast then run\nBut I know know there's that one person everyone has\nThat messed them up and they're still thinking about them\n...\n\n", 
        "The temperature is rising from the heat\nI feel desire burning in the street\nUh I? m missing you, you said you love me too\nUh honey, where are you? Under this sky blue\n\nLouisiana Sunday afternoon\nLord, you got to help me make it through\nI can? t wait to see my baby soon\nLouisiana Sunday afternoon\n\nI can feel temptation in my bones\nBut I? m sitting here in my room all alone\nUh I? m missing you, you said you love me forever\nWish I was kissing you and we could be together\n...\n\n", 
        "The favorite doesn't always win\nNo matter what they are\nSince nobody knows how they'll come in\nI'll leave it to the God\n\nSo wish me a luck\nBecause I'm going to bet on\n...\n\n",

        "From too much talk to silent touches\nSweet touches, we turned our hearts to love\nThen tried it, first time romance\nThere in the quiet, love learns to dance\n\nWe loved, we slept, we left the lights on\nThe night's gone and morning\n...\n\n", 
        "It don't mean a thing\nIf it ain't got that swing\n(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah\nDoo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)\nIt don't mean a thing\n...\n\n"
