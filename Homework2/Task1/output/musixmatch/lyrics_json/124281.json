        "Here\u2019s a song that finally you can understand\nA minor statement meant to counteract the bland\nA list of wraithlike things\nThat quicken the heart\n\nJust another song; a faded memory\nA raison d\u2019etre for the entire family\nI don\u2019t remember it well\nI was in love for a spell\n\nCopies of Sight and Sound she left lying around on the floor\nThey said I\u2019d forget her voice\nThat\u2019s untrue\n...\n\n", 
        "Bury me\nLike dangerous waste.\nI'll lay dormant\nFor a thousand years.\nBut it's like dismantling\nA decommissioned spacecraft.\nSome parts you can't destroy.\n\nShe fidgets too much.\nI've got a bee in my bonnet.\n\nStay aspirant\nTo avoid accident\nOn my return\nI will smother you.\nIn everything that I've learned\n...\n\n", 
        "The comforting ache\nOf the summer holidays\nPointless days pining\nAfternoons whining\nThe suburbs scream\nAt passers by\nThey scream of escape\nA mute siren\n\nIn wasted light\nHope takes flight\n\nI don\u2019t mind losing self-respect\nI\u2019ve done it before and I\u2019ll do it again\nI\u2019m stifled tonight, which is fine\n...\n\n", 
        "Calm those vowels down\nNo-one's thinking of you right now.\nShe's dressed up - It's her duty to the town.\nIt's empty. It's vast.\nBut it imposes it's will.\n\nIn a crowded room\nHer painted features smothered in the gloom -\nAlready resigned\nAt night she scrapes\nAway the face that she creates\nThe mirror sighs...\n\nWhy can't we always meet\nUnder a cloud of mystery?\nThe noise from a hundred mouths\nWorking through memory\n\n...\n\n", 
        "How many words did you come up with today?\nHow many words do you want to hear tonight?\nYou flare up but beneath lies defeat.\nI see your eyes now and they are calm.\n\nI've answered enough phones for one life.\nI've worn too many ties around my neck.\n\nI wake up and I find a trace of you there.\nSo sullen, your words haunt the air\nI wake up and I find a trace of you there.\n...\n\n", 
        "You're looking so pleased with yourself.\nI'm gonna come over there and wipe that smile off your face.\nPetty crimes in your leisure time\nYou struggled to break out.\nWash away on your cheap mistakes.\nYour abstinence; your drought.\n\nIn another world you would've found me by now.\nBut you'll still end up on a revolving dance floor in the middle of the river.\n\nCome over here, my dear.\nI need to have a little word in your ear.\n...\n\n", 
        "Let's go back to your house\nAnd finish off the gin.\nIn your dishevelled room\nWe're gonna wash ourselves in sin.\n\nOoh! It's criminal when you whisper in my ear\nLet's get clinical the words delivered with a sneer\nLet's get clinical.\n\nI'd like to map your body out\nInch by inch\nNorth to South\nAnd I'm free for circumnavigation\n\nReawaken my delight\nYour fingerprints upon my skin\nYour voice is twisted; how we sink\n...\n\n", 
        "We shared a bed but never touched\nNext time we compensated in a rush\nWe're showing no signs of fatigue\nI've Got a friend to act as a go-between\nThere's a distant drawl to your delivery\nYou deliver me.\nAnd when I'm dry you resuscitate me\nYou resuscitate me.\n\nThis bed's too tight\nStepped upon your records in the night.\nPut on your favourite skirt\n've got a plan that will never work.\nThis isn't the first time but it still feels innocent\nI just want to kiss you.\nThere won't be a time when my mind strays to you\n...\n\n", 
        "The younger one\nDarkly tanned\nChewing gum\nMint on her mischievous tongue\nMingling with a taste of tin\nOn her gums\n\nEach layer removed\nRevealed a paler shade of skin\nEach subtle shade\nFelt like a secret shared\n\nShe was my reward\nAnd I was hers.\nThe summer glazed our skin\nBut it scorched everything.\n...\n\n", 
        "Questing,\nI am not coasting\nNor will I ever\nDespite this weather.\n\nI said...\nHey you!\nWhat's new?\nI know your face\nHey you!\nWhat's new?\nLet's go some place\nMy thoughts that flit\nMy loosening grip\nI need to connect to you now\n\nOn our knees against the window sill\nWatching the sheet lightening fly\n...\n\n", 
        "I've met so many people who look the same\nMost were forgotten but you still remain\nMost of the time, I don't care\nBut London's so far away when you are there.\nAnd so it saddens me to say\nI'm only happy when I move away\n\nI am young and I am lost\nEvery sentence has its cost\nI am young and I am lost\nYou react to my riposte\n\nAnd we look out upon the sea\n\nWe look out upon the sea\nThe coast is always changing\nI'll bring my camera out to sea\nThe coast is always changing\n\nAge makes no difference 'til you open your mouth\n...\n\n", 
        "1 in a million\n2 is a crowd\n3 is company\n4's not allowed\n\nI spent all night trying\nTo remember your address\nDrawing lines around your body\nMaking marks on the mucky floor\n\n5 little fingers\n6 digit fix\nMy lucky 7\nThere are 8 steps to my hips\n\n...\n\n",
