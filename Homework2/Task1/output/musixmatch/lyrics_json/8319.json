        "I went out walking the other day\nThe heat hung wet around my neck\nMy head it rung with screams and groans\nFrom the night I spent amongst her bones\n\nAnd I past beside the mission house\nWhere that mad old buzzard, the reverend\nShrieked and flapped\nAbout life after you're dead\n\nWell, I thought about my friend, Michel\nHow they rolled him in linoleum\nAnd they shot him in the neck\nA bloody halo, like a think-bubble\n\nCircling his head and I bellowed at the firmament\nLooks like the rains are hear to stay\nAnd the rain pissed down upon me\nAnd washed me all away, saying\n\n? Papa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, boy\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, boy?\n\n? Well, the road is long and the road is hard\nAnd many fall by the side\nBut Papa won't leave you, Henry\nSo there ain't no need to cry?\n\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\n\nWell, the moon it looked exhausted\nLike something you should pity\nSpent an age-spotted\nAbove the sizzling wires of the city\n\nWell, it reminded me of her face\nAnd her bleached and hungry eyes\nHer hair was like a curtain\nFalling open with the laughter\n\nAnd closing with the lies\nAnd the ghost of her still lingers on\nThough she's passed through me\nAnd is gone\n\nWell, the slum dogs, they are barking\n...\n\n", 
        "I had a dream\nI had a dream\nI had a dream, Joe\n\nI had a dream, Joe\nYou were standing in the middle of an open road\nI had a dream, Joe\nYour hands were raised up to the sky\nAnd your mouth was covered in foam\nI had a dream, Joe\nA shadowy Jesus flitted from tree to tree\nI had a dream, Joe\nAnd a society of whores stuck needles in an image of me\nI had a dream, Joe\nIt was Autumn time and thickly fell the leaves\nAnd in that dream, Joe\nA pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick\nAnd pointed his finger at me\n...\n\n", 
        "All the towers of ivory are crumbling\nAnd the swallows have sharpened their beaks\nThis is the time of our great undoing\nThis is the time that I'll come running\nStraight to you\nFor I am captured\nStraight to you\nFor I am captured\nOne more time\n\nThe light in our window is fading\nThe candle gutters on the ledge\nWell now sorrow, it comes a-stealing\n...\n\n", 
        "Brother, my cup is empty\nAnd I haven't got a penny\nFor to buy no more whiskey\nI have to go home\n\nI am the captain of my pain\nTis the bit, the bridle,\nThe trashing cane\nThe stirrup, the harness\nThe whipping mane\nThe pickled eye\nThe shrinking brain\nO brother, buy me one more drink\nI'll explain the nature of my pain\nYes, let me tell you once again\nI am the captain of my pain\n\nO brother, my cup is empty\nAnd I haven't got a penny\nFor to buy no more whiskey\nI have to go home\n\nI cannot blame it all on her\nTo blame her all would be a lie\nFor many a night I lay awake\n...\n\n", 
        "Christina the Astonishing\nLived a long time ago\nShe was stricken with a seizure\nAt the age of twenty-two\n\nThey took her body in a coffin\nTo a tiny church in Liege\nWhere she sprang up from the coffin\nJust after the Agnus Dei\n\nShe soared up to the rafters\n...\n\n", 
        "When I first came to town\nAll the people gathered round\nThey bought me drinks\nLord, how they quickly changed their tune\n\nWhen I first came to town\nPeople took me round from end to end\nLike someone may take round a friend\nO how quickly they changed their tune\n\nSuspicion and dark murmurs surround me\nEverywhere I go they confound me\nAs though the blood on my hands\nIs there for every citizen to see\n\nO sweet Jesus\nThere is no turning back\nThere is always one more town\nA little further down the track\n\n...\n\n",
