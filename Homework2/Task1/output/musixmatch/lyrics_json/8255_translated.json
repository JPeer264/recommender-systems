        "(Baritone and Chorus)\nCirca mea pectora\nmulta sunt suspiria\nde tua pulchritudine,\nque me ledunt misere.\nManda liet,\nManda liet\nmin geselle\nchumet niet.\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Face of spring turns to the world, sharp winter now flees, vanquished; bedecked in various colors Flora reigns, the woods praises in song. ...", 
        "The sun warms everything, pure and gentle, once again it reveals to the world April&#39;s face, the soul of a young man to love and joys are governed by the boy-god. ...", 
        "O Fortune, like the moon you are changeable, ever waxing and waning; hateful life now oppresses and then soothes as fancy takes it; poverty and power it melts them like ice. ...", 
        "SWAZ HIE GAT UMBE\n\nSwaz hie gat umbe, Those who go round and round\ndaz sint alles megede, are all maidens\ndie wellent an man they want to do without a man\nallen disen sumer gan! Ah! Sla! all summer long. Ah! Sla!\n\nCHUME, CHUM, GESELLE MIN\n\n...\n\n"
