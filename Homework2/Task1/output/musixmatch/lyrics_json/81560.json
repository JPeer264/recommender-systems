        "We've been climbing uphill together\nFor three years and counting\nLife kicks us when we're down but we\n(We just keep trying!)\n\nWhat else can we do?\nDwell on the past and it will bury you\nBut it's getting harder to look ahead\nWith all these conflicting thoughts in my head\n\nThe days are too dark\nAnd they last too fucking long\nThat's why we made a promise\n...\n\n", 
        "We came crashing down, right on time,\nLike the twenty-ninth of twenty nine.\nDays spent down on our knees,\nWatching stolen soil sift through our fingers.\nSo what the fuck are we still waiting for?\nFor some someone to save us?\nFor the rains to come?\nWatching strong foundations come undone.\n\nWe're not waiting for the dust to settle anymore.\n...\n\n", 
        "...\n\n", 
        "This marks the return of a threat\nThat we should have never taken back;\nTo live our lives with unwavering intent\nAnd in the spirit of a new romance\n\nGrowing up in an age where monotony reigns\nIt's so easy to keep your heart and mind locked away\nAnd it's up to you to rise up\nTo break away!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Prepare your soul! (x2)\n\nHow did it feel to fail?\nHow did it feel to feel?\n\nAll of those times\nWe tried our very hardest,\nAnd our best was never\nGood enough for them!\n\nWell those days have come\n(To an end)\nMy friends!\n\nWe no longer\nAnswer to anyone\nAnd this new life\n...\n\n", 
        "Force fed from the outside\nWe live a crowded life it seems\nFragile minds in a fast paced world\nCan't compute the images coming through the screens\n\nCan't seem to bridge the gap between\nA.M. reality and late night schemes\n\nCan't seem to focus\nAs the glitter\nFades to green!\n\nWe've lost control!\n(We've lost control!)\nWe've lost control!\n(We've lost control!)\n...\n\n", 
        "Between the world and me\nPressure-splitting seams\nImminent danger in the headlines\n\nGlamour on the T.V.\nChasing fools gold\n...\n\n", 
        "This is ambition,\nAs ugly as it gets;\nUncommon kids and their fight against an early death,\nBy common sense!\n\nThis is motivation,\nFree of contempt;\nOur generation has come of age,\nAnd left us here with bitterness!\n\nSo when you're feeling jagged,\nAnd you think you've gone fucking mad\n(Salt your wounds!)\nFeel the sting of the things you never had,\nThe things you always wanted,\n...\n\n", 
        "We were young, numb, and violent,\nAll at once!\nWe were always smashing glass but\nIt was never enough,\nTo make us feel okay\n\nAre we normal boys?\nIs this the normal way?\nWe've been dragging dead weight across Midwest towns,\nKilling our times with our frowns\n\nAlone in the crowd\n(Four years down!)\nfeeling torn and beaten down\n\nAlone in the crowd\n...\n\n", 
        "Another new beginning:\nDown the fucking drain!\n\nScreaming \"never again\"\nAs we watch it wash away!\nYeah!\n\nGod Damn!\n...\n\n", 
        "We've been abandoned!\nYeah, we've been left behind!\n\nRed hot daggers in our conscious through the long cold night\nAre we growing ugly?\nAre we wasting time?\n\nTell me your truth, kid\nI'll tell you mine\nI've crawled through obscurity to find\nThe heavy burden of a wasted life\n\nGo north\nEndure the pain in your burning young mind\n...\n\n", 
        "Down the old staircase\nI'm walking out the door\nI feel lost here tonight\nEverything has changed\nSince that summer before\n\nStumbling forward\nI'm glancing back\nThere's no one in the window begging me to come back!\n\nThe streetlights are burning\nBut I'm not yet ready for this day to be done\n'Cus I always come up short\nI'm always lusting for something more\n\nAnd so I push\nRight into the night!\n...\n\n", 
        "Is it wrong to want to walk away?\nWhen every day of your life looks like today\nAnd today looks like a rotting, lifeless grey!\n\nI don't know Where things went wrong with me\nBut I feel like I've become a timid shadow\nOf the person I've always wanted to be!\n\nAnd I've been thinking about my past today\nThinking of all those times I was afraid\nAnd all those times that I felt worthless and ashamed!\n\nI know, I thought I was strong, I said I would never change\n...\n\n", 
        "So what the fuck are you going to do, kid?\nStill ratting at the chains of the gates of the world...\nBut you can't quite pretend.\n\nStill tasting youth's bitter exile here in your empty generation's wasteland...\nWhere all the things that you've been clinging to are being ripped from your hands.\n\nRestless soul this place will never be your home.\nAnd if you wanna have it all...\nYou've gotta let it all go.\n...\n\n", 
        "Martin, I've seen, the ones you oughta bleed\nThey've been driving around, in their big stylish cars\nWell, I think they oughta feel your pain, yeah\nI think they oughta wear your scars\n\n'Cus what Ruby told you, well that was true\nNow you better lace up those boots\nOnly you knew how it felt when the pretty girls looked at you that way\nAnd somebody is gonna hafta pay\n\nHe's gonna get his revenge\n(Revenge!)\nHe's gonna crucify himself for the world's sins\nHis name was Atchet\nHe was one of them (x2)\n...\n\n", 
        "The neighbor boy is home from the war.\nHis father's pride...\nIt spills across the factory floor.\nAnd Jimmy, in the paper, I saw you...\nHolding that gun\n...\n\n", 
        "Driving in from the edge of town.\nIce cold winter sun is going down.\nAnd I'm staring just the way I used to through that dirty all night restaurant window.\nJust thinkin' bout the things I wish I could give up and the things that won't let me go.\nBut I know I'm gonna be alright.\nMy mind won't focus I take an out of the way drive in and around the north side of town where the smoke from hell's exaust pipe lingers above the cheap rent in the dark night.\n...\n\n", 
        "Making come true our modest, impossible dreams\nStuck in public school classrooms, at age fifteen!\nThose long hot days, just before the summer\nKnowing that we're stuck here!\n\nAnd there's something happening somewhere\nKnowing we know, we gotta get there\nIt's true what they say,\nDeath is more perfect than life\nThat's why we already died!\n\nWhat could have been?\nWe don't wanna know!\nTonight we'll get our kicks\nTonight we're all letting go,\n'Cus we're all Dead Ramones!\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm in an awful state, It's getting late, and I'm full of questions\nMy overactive mind has been wastin' all my time.\nSo I've been wandering aimless every night and sleeping every day\nBut it really doesn't matter anyways 'cus-\nThe second coming has been cancelled since\nSometime around '82 when Jesus looked down from his cloud and saw school kids-\nThey were duck and covering\n...\n\n", 
        "In this life, there are no clean breaks\nBut starting again is a chance that you can take\nI always thought that someday we would overcome the bad luck-\nAnd from the burden, the gift would come\nMaybe I shoulda known better\nBut I know we're coming closer to the end-\nOf whatever this has been\n\n...\n\n", 
        "I'm walkin' past liquor stores and immigrant homes...\nCheck into cash...\nAnd men with eyes like ghosts.\nAs boys we were taught to dream in stacks and rows...\nCause to dream any bigger is to dig yourself a hole...\nOne bigger than you're already in from the moment your life begins.\nI'm soaked to the bone at Lawson Arms at 3 a.m.\nThis cold world has convinced me to betray myself again.\nSome faceless men.\nShivering.\nBetrayal.\nI am one of them.\nNever again.\nI feel the loneliness of the long distance runner now.\n...\n\n", 
        "I promised myself I wouldn't lead you on.\nSo here it is confused and flawed.\n\nAs foolish as these words may seem.\nAs foolish as I may be.\nSee, I'm just a factory worker's son from a railroad town.\nAnd yeah, I can feel the steel mills rust.\nBut I've been doing my time and I've been thinking about getting out.\nI'm running fast the other way down a narrow dead end road.\nI know this won't be the last time I sing\n\"These dreams will be my anchor.\nThese dreams will be the death of me.\"\nThrough all this I've been feeling like\nI'm slowly burning out...\nNothing is all bad...\nNothing is quite right.\nSo I kept inking and screaming from my room...\nThe only way I know how to...\n...\n\n"
