I think you\u00b4re having trouble understanding\nWhat it takes to fly the globe and keep the crowds demanding\nMore of the type of the beats you felt\nThe kind of smoothness you associate to cream that melts\nAll over tracks distinctive patterns are created\nLike an emblem on the ground that says it's highly rated\nYou figured it out, how much energy when we lash it out\nHow much goes into a show just when we move and bash it out, eye\u00b4in them out\nIt's no coincidence were up here\nWe\u00b4re not the lucky team who had the lucky run & cup year\n\n...\n\n",
