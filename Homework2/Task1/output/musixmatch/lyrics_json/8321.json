        "How carelessly the bound daylight caresses\nOblivious to wandering eyes extinguished\nFree me reckless with the night\nElusive scenes enkindled burst to fire\nWhere splendor casts umbrageous twin\nAnd love sparks radiance\nTo guide the heart from within\nAll in search for you\nEve of brilliance\nTill the morning proves indifference\n...\n\n", 
        "I am my only thief\nAnd jailer keep\nBedeviled and priest beseech\nThe pander come to me\n\nBut mad love\nIs religion enough\nFor my heart\n\nAnd to those I gave life\nConfessions of a gift worth end\nI am the spirit's grin kissed\nWith the taste of silent tears\n\nAnd the glutton for emptiness\n...\n\n", 
        "A thousand dreamers crept as one\nJourney'd by the colder sun\nKnocked at the chamber's gate\nYet this sleeper does not wake\nIn the oracle overhung\nWith careless whispers, ivystung\nTheir tiny fingers cling to warmth\nA home for the love weary heart\nOnward sacrarium, time sojourns\nPolanquin leads this path adorned\n...\n\n", 
        "", 
        "Ophelia\nCordelia\nDesdemona\nAnd Kate\nMy sweetness and Beatrice\nSo precious your pain\nI sing for your lovers\nYour heavenly fathers to be\nYour possible futures\nYour obvious endings defeat me\nAlma\nBadoura\nDorothea\nAnd Jade\nBelphoebe is just like me\nSuch perfect disdain\nI sing for the daughters\nThe heavenly mothers to be\nInsanity's wanderings\nRitual fatherings greet me\n...\n\n", 
        "When to her lute Corinna sings\nHer voice revives the leaden strings\nAnd doth on highest note appeare\nAs any challeng'd echo cleare\n...\n\n", 
        "In kairos hour I bequeath\nConfusion of my sole belief\nConsider: am I god in mortal shell\nYet shine no brighter than myself\n\nInvaded by life's patriarch\nWho conquered me through hatred's art\nWith fists of all unspoken sin\n...\n\n", 
        "Here, thoughts cling airborne\nTo a sea of voice so glorious; mesmerizing\nThis is my body; this is my inner mind\nWhat lies beneath my eyes\n\nDiscarded years of elemental faith\nBeckoned to a watery embrace\nWith love upon his face\nMy appetite's unchanged\n\nSink into dream; these enchanted depths\nThe realm of muted wisdom\nSlowly descend; trust ignites the darkness\nAnd bliss is this drowning moment\n...\n\n", 
        "Come to life my deviltry\nPossess this poor company\nOur secret be benefit\nTheir unhappy lack of it\nAwaken my trusting friend\nMy undisturbed reflection\nSo fluid your beauty\nAll gears and teeth\n\nCome Alive\n...\n\n", 
        "Hear me my beloved; I beckon thee through waves of dream\nAnd in mine ears a voice whispers oceans of light\nAnd in thine eyes alone begins this journey of mine\nIs this love? Thou art love; thou art truth\nThou art a vision resplendent and I am born with recognition\nFor I have known thee a thousand years yet never known thee before\nWhen thy radiance spoke my name I was a king restored\nAnd my kingdom pales in the gloriousness of thee\nAnd my fortunes mask an emptiness filled only by this\nWhere our world exists beyond this brilliant dream\nI shall find thee, thou art the answer\n...\n\n", 
        "And if I'd the spell to claim your existence\nYour clandestine thoughts; your soul's soft persistence\nI'd follow the mirror aglow with your image\nYour water-grave eyes, and your lingering fragrance\n\nBut unknown by you; lost in the shadows\n...\n\n", 
        "O my dear brother I am damnified at Caer Siddi\nFor mine husband hath this twelfmonth treated me with cruelty\nAlbe to please thee I didst cheerfully accept his proffred hand\nI was ne'er wary he was ruler of y Uffern land\nFor when his gastful subjects they didst first espy hir friendless Queen\nEftsoone they wept for I to them was noughte but a living thing\nHence with despight his consorted kingdoms stony heart eshewde\nAnd I am thrall'd to sufferance in poverty and servitude\n\nFor I am one of three great queens of the Cymry\n\nLoneliness\n...\n\n", 
        "Low ye hills in ocean lie\n(Hob y derri dando)\nHide not Meirion from my eye\n(Hob y derri dando)\nStill one view, oh let me take\n(Down derri down)\nEre my longing heart do break\n(Down down hie derri down)\nMy darling Mary do not frown\n(Down down hie derri down)\nMy darling Mary do not frown\n\n...\n\n", 
        "Beneath the sediment of aeons\nIn ancient repose\nMy trust lay eroded by age\nThe old glory faded\nAnd past times forgotten\nMy reign given way to my rage\n\nHarmonious the centuries\nThe land and I were one\nMy soil, my water, my air\nBringer of light\nAnd master of night\nIn balance, the earth in my care\n\nBut with the passing of days\nA new wind came blowing\nWith whispers of change on its wing\nThis tide of corruption\n...\n\n", 
        "Come the tides\nWe hear tell of a mortal season\nFed rife with rhyme and reason\nTained with despair\n\nKill-darkened skies\nPainted black, so black with misery\nRaining down with the impunity\nOh, the cross we've brought to bear\n\nIn the treason fields\nWhere man again destroys what man built\nMan wears the weighted cloak of man's guilt\nFor the blind we must remind\n\nRaise your eyes\nBehind a martyr's mask of supplication\nI find you guilty by association\nMute, somehow divine\n\nI sing true\n...\n\n",
